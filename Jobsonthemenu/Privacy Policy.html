<strong>HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong>
</p>
<p> When you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, the employer customer who has hired CareerBuilder to create and operate this Talent Network on its behalf receives your Personal Information and may use your information to contact you directly.
</p>
<p> The use of your information by the employer customer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and CareerBuilder is not responsible for that company’s use of your information.
CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the employer customer does with your information.
You should review the privacy policy of the employer customer to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
</p>
<p> The employer customer for whom we act as a service provider to operate this Talent Network will receive reports that contain non-personally identifiable information about its Talent Network.
Non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Talent Network (including your internet protocol address) is used in order to operate, maintain and manage the Talent Network.
</p>
<p> Additionally, CareerBuilder may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about Talent Network users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for its users (typically employers or educators).
“Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.
Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.
For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five years’ experience that live within a certain geographic area.
All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.
</p>

<p> Personal Information may be shared with service providers who help in the delivery of the Talent Network.
These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on behalf of the Talent Network or as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p> Specific user information may be disclosed when a determination is made, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of the employer customer, CareerBuilder or other users of the Talent Network.
</p>
<p> In addition, Personal Information collected through the Talent Network may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of the employer customer or CareerBuilder.
