</ul>
<p>Also, Lydia Payment Accounts are not intended to serve as a channel for cash flow between different accounts or payment means. "Round trip" transactions, particularly between a deferred debit account and an immediate debit account, constitute improper use of Lydia. In the event of repeated use of this type of operation, Lydia reserves the right to close the Lydia Consumer Account and/or levy a penalty (see <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits</a> appendix) for non-compliance with these T&amp;Cs, taken directly from their Lydia Payment Accounts before closing the Consumer Account.If the Consumer wishes to obtain more information about the limits of the conditions of use, they can contact the Customer Care Service at the email address: support@lydia-app.com.</p>
<p>If the Service is used to purchase products or services resulting from such activities, the Consumer Account will be closed. In addition, the Consumer will be liable to a penalty (see Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix) for non-compliance with these T&amp;Cs, taken directly from his/her Consumer Account before its closure.</p>

<h2>6. How to install Lydia</h2>
<p>The list of countries in which the Lydia Application can be downloaded  from applications stores is available in the Lydia user Manual and is reproduced on the the following page: https://support.lydia-app.com/l/fr/article/lcu8v7dbca-pays-compatibles-avec-lydia. </p>
<p>In order to be able to access the Lydia Service, the Consumer must possess equipment that is compatible with the Lydia Application (a cell phone such as a smartphone, or a mobile tablet or any other compatible connected object). Although Lydia makes its best efforts to optimize the compatibility of its Service, it cannot guarantee its operation with all existing terminals on the market and in particular terminals equipped with obsolete Android or I.O.S operating systems.</p>
<p>In order to download the Application and to use the Service in good conditions, the Individual Consumer must also have sufficient access to the Internet network (public or private WIFI and/or access to the GSM network). </p>
<p>Under these conditions, access to the Lydia Service is then possible by downloading on the Consumer's equipment the Lydia Application, available free of charge on the application stores (Google Play, the App Store and Huawei AppGallery) and in rarer cases via dedicated websites. (see What other services and features does the Lydia application offer?) </p>
<p>The Consumer is also responsible for ensuring that he/she has installed the latest update of the Lydia Application in order to benefit from the whole Service in optimal and secure conditions. </p>
<p>After installing the Lydia Application, the Consumer must carefully read and accept these T&amp;Cs and the Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix, permanently available on the Lydia website and application. Lydia also invites the Consumer to review the Lydia Personal Data Protection Policy available in the same manner. </p>
<p></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB"></span></h2>
<h2>7. How much does Lydia cost?<span lang="EN-GB"> </span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p>By default, the Consumer subscribes to a free account, subject to the limits indicated in the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a>. Consumers who wish to use Lydia beyond these limits may obtain Verified User status (See Article 8) and/or subscribe to the paid Lydia service (See Lydia's Terms and Conditions of Sale for paid subscriptions).</p>
<p>Exceeding limits may result in extra costs, detailed in the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inactivity fees for inactive account maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In accordance with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eckert Law</span> of June 13, 2014, Lydia may charge an inactivity fee of up to €30 per year for an inactive payment account. The amount of the inactivity fee is indicated in the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a> and is limited to the balance available on the Payment Account. </p>
<p dir="ltr">A Consumer Account is considered as inactive if the two following conditions are met: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Consumer Account (or any Payment Account) has not been subject to any Transaction (excluding debit by Lydia, fees and commissions of any kind, and excluding the deduction of fees) at the initiative of the Consumer or any person authorized by him; </li>
<li>The Consumer has not contacted Lydia in any form whatsoever for twelve (12) consecutive months. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">An account is also considered inactive if the account holder has died and if, at the end of 12 (twelve) consecutive months from the date of death, the account meets only one condition: none of his / her heirs has informed Lydia of his / her wish to assert his / her rights on the assets and deposits registered on the accounts of the deceased. As soon as the inactivity is established, Lydia informs the beneficiaries known to its services of the consequences if the inactivity is maintained over time. This information is renewed annually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In case of an inactive account, Lydia will contact the Consumer by email and/or by text message using the email address and/or phone number provided in the Application. Lydia will offer to reactivate or close the Consumer's Account. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If the Consumer does not contact the Customer Care service via support@lydia-app.com and/or does not perform any operation from or to their Payment Accounts within the delay prescribed, Lydia will collect fees in accordance with the Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix if the Consumer Account balance is creditor. If the Consumer remains inactive for ten consecutives years, his/her Consumer Account will be closed and the balance remaining will be transferred to the Caisse des dépôts. The Consumer will be informed of such transfer six months in advance. The Consumer can contact the Caisse des dépôts within 20 years after the transfer to reclaim their funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Specific transactions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account operating incidents</span></p>
<p>Transactions requiring special treatment, in particular when they lead to an operating incident on the Consumer Account (insufficient funds, file fees, management of unpaid bank cards or rejected bank transfers, etc.), are subject to invoicing (see <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a>). </p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Seizure by bailiff and third party notice</u></p>
<p dir="ltr">When Lydia is notified with a seizure of money, whether contributory or conservatory, it is obliged to declare and block the available balance of the payment account opened in the name of the Consumer, even if this balance is higher than the amount of the seizure. Within 15 working days after the attachment or seizure, this balance may be affected (positively or negatively) by the transactions dated before the attachment. The Consumer may contest the seizure initiated against him / her before the execution judge. In the case of a seizure procedure, Lydia will proceed to the payment of the funds due to the seizing creditor upon presentation of a certificate of non-contestation or upon a written declaration by the Consumer indicating that he/she does not contest the seizure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Administrative seizure by third party holder: This procedure is used by the Trésor Public for the recovery of taxes, penalties and incidental expenses. It has the effect of blocking the available balance opened in the name of the Consumer, even if this balance is higher than the amount of the seizure. Within a period of 15 working days following the seizure, this balance may be affected (positively or negatively) by transactions whose date is prior to the seizure. At the end of a period of one month (unless a different period is specifically provided for), Lydia is obliged to pay the amount claimed to the Trésor Public, unless the latter releases it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In each of these situations, Lydia will leave at the Consumer's disposal, under the conditions and according to the terms defined by Article L. 162-2 of the Code of Civil Enforcement Procedures, and within the limit of the credit balance of the payment account or of the sub-accounts on the day of the seizure, a sum of money of a maintenance nature equal to the amount for a single recipient of the Active Solidarity Income (RSA), called the unseizable bank balance (hereinafter referred to as the “SBI”). </p>
<p dir="ltr">These various procedures initiated by the creditor, and with which Lydia is legally obliged to comply, give rise to the collection of fixed fees debited to the Payment Account and reducing the SBI if necessary. The amount of this fee is detailed in the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a> and may not exceed the available balance on the Consumer's Payment Account. Lydia will automatically deduct these fees when sending the funds to the relevant authority. </p>
<h2>8. How to obtain the Verified User status?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Remote Identity Verification</strong></p>
<p>Consumers who reach certain limits, detailed in the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a>, must obtain the "Verified User" status before being able to continue using their Lydia Consumer Account.</p>
<p>The "Verified User" status also allows Consumers to access specific services (for example, issuing Internet cards).</p>
<p>The Consumer may therefore request this status at any time from the Application. Lydia guarantees easy, direct and permanent access to the remote identity verification policy defined below.</p>
<p>To obtain the "Verified User" status, the Consumer is invited to follow a remote identity verification path:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) The user can opt for the main remote identity verification path</span>: in this case, the Consumer must transmit the following identification data from the Lydia Application:</p>
<p>(a) ​A color video, with a minimum resolution of 720p (280 × 720 at 25 frames per second), without digital alteration or the presence of effects or filters, of a valid official identification document in the user's name. The video is made by the Consumer with his / her cell phone and includes movements of the document in front of the video sensor, based on the rules that are displayed to the Consumer. The document must be a valid official identity document issued by a member state of the European Union ("EU"), or by the Principality of Monaco or Andorra or the Swiss Confederation and contain an MRZ ("Machine-Readable Zone") strip.</p>
<p>It is hereby specified that only official identity documents certifying both the identity and the nationality of their holder are accepted, namely :</p>
<p>- For French nationals, nationals of other European Union Member States, of a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area or of the Swiss Confederation, the national identity card (front and back of a national identity card OR , passport; front and back of a residence permit, front of a driver's license in the new European format or front of a driver's license in the new European format);</p>
<p>- For third-country nationals residing in France or in another Member State of the European Union, in a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, the residence permit, drawn up in accordance with the model provided for in Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1954 of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2017 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals and issued by the State of residence.</p>
<p>- For third-country nationals exempted from the short-stay visa requirement who do not reside in the territory of the European Union, a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, the passport, provided that the issuing country makes available the means necessary to verify the validity of the document. If the exemption from the visa requirement is accompanied by the requirement to have an electronic passport, only the electronic passport is recognized as an authoritative source for the country concerned.</p>
<p>- For third-country nationals who are refugees or recognized as stateless or beneficiaries of protection under Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, the passport is replaced by the travel document issued by the state that recognized the status of refugee or stateless person or granted protection. </p>
<p>Note: From 1 January 2014, the validity period of the national identity card has been increased from 10 to 15 years for adults (over 18). This extension of the validity period does not apply to persons who were minors at the time their national identity card was issued (article 10 of Decree No. 2013-1188 of 18 December 2013 relating to the duration of validity and conditions of issue and renewal of the national identity card).</p>
<p>AND,</p>
<p>(b) A color "video selfie", i.e. a video capture of the Consumer's face, with a minimum resolution of 720p (1280 × 720 at 25 frames per second) without digital alteration or the presence of effects or filters, during which the Consumer is asked to identify himself and/or to orally say a random sentence. The "video selfie" must also be taken in an appropriate setting and in appropriate attire, and Lydia retains the right to refuse any video selfie that contravenes this directive</p>
<p>Nota Bene: A biometric processing of the face of the Consumer, captured during the selfie-video, is performed by Lydia. This specific processing allows or confirms the unique identification of an individual based on his physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics. It also allows the detection of the "living" character of the User to verify that the User has not been physically or digitally altered. This biometric data is considered sensitive within the meaning of EU Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, known as the GDPR. In order to use this processing, Lydia therefore justifies a specific need to identify its users to allow access to the Service, under the control of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (hereinafter referred to as the "CNIL" ).</p>
<p>The Consumer is free to choose during the remote identification process to obtain the "Verified User" status whether to use the biometric device or not and may choose to use another authentication method offered by Lydia, without any additional constraint, incentive or special consideration. </p>
<p>The Consumer will also be asked to provide his/her home address during the main remote identity verification process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) The user can opt for the alternative remote identity verification path</span>, if the Consumer does not wish to take a "selfie-video", he/she will be required to transmit the following identification data from the Lydia Application: </p>
<p>(a) ​A color video, with a minimum resolution of 720p (280 × 720 at 25 frames per second), without digital alteration or the presence of effects or filters, of a valid official identification document in the user's name. The video is made by the Consumer with his / her cell phone and includes movements of the document in front of the video sensor, based on the rules that are displayed to the Consumer. </p>
<p>The following are accepted as official identity documents:</p>
<p>- Any title that meets the requirements set forth in Article 7, 1) a) of these T&amp;Cs OR,</p>
<p>- For nationals not residing in the territory of the European Union, in a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation the passport (provided that the issuing country provides the means necessary to verify the validity of the document) AND the valid visa as proof of entry and legal residence on French territory (in particular the Schengen short-stay visa, the temporary long-stay visa, the short-stay visa bearing the mention "student-competition", the "working vacation" visa, etc.). ).</p>
<p>(b) Aggregation of a Bank Account in the name and surname of the Consumer opened with a financial institution established in the European Union or the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>The Consumer will also be asked to provide his / her home address during the alternative remote identity verification process.</p>
<p>(c) At the same time, during the main and alternative remote identity verification paths, if the Consumer is between 14 and 17 years old, he/she will be asked to provide by e-mail a certificate from his/her legal representative, written on plain paper, dated and signed, stating that the Consumer is acting under his/her supervision and with his/her agreement, accompanied by a color copy of both sides of a valid official identity document of the latter. </p>
<p>(d) At the same time, during the main and alternative remote identity verification paths, if the Consumer benefits from a legal protection regime reserved for adults (safeguard of justice, curatorship, guardianship, future protection mandate), he/she OR his/her legal representative will be obliged to transmit to Lydia, spontaneously or upon request, additional supporting documents (in particular the decision of the competent protection judge stating the protection measure with regard to the Consumer and designating his legal representative and a copy of both sides of the legal representative's identity card in color).</p>
<p><strong>Face-to-face Identity Verification</strong></p>
<p>In the context of exceptional events, the Consumer may  also obtain the "Verified User" status verifying his identity with an authorized Lydia Agent, face to face. In this case, the Consumer presents his/her official title and valid ID to the authorized Lydia Agent, who verifies its validity. The Lydia Agent takes a double-sided copy or a color video of this document and formalizes the face-to-face meeting by sending an e-mail. It is hereby clarified that the official identity document presented to the Lydia Agent must meet the requirements set forth in Article 7, 1) a) hereof.  The Consumer will also be asked to provide the Lydia Agent with his/her residence address. </p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB"></span></h2>
<h2>9. How does Lydia work?</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1: Opening a Payment Account</strong></p>
<p>To benefit from the Service, the Consumer accepts the opening of at least one Payment Account when subscribing. Lydia sends the Consumer a message acknowledging receipt of their request and informing them of the opening of a Payment Account, under the conditions described in Article 17 hereof.</p>
<p>A Payment Account is denominated in Euros (€) and records the payment, collection and transfer operations carried out by or for the benefit of the Consumer. The Payment Account and all sub-accounts attached to a Client Account are denominated in the same currency and have the same international account identifier (IBAN, International Bank Account Number). A Consumer can only issue or receive payments in the currency in which their Payment Accounts are denominated. Thus, if the Consumer's Bank Account is in a different currency to their Lydia Payment Accounts, its banking institution might charge conversion fees.</p>
<p>Lydia expressly reminds the Consumer that according to Article L314-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, a payment account is an account held in the name of one or more persons, used for the purpose of executing payment transactions; that a Payment Account can in no way be assimilated to a Bank Account and that the balance of a Payment Account cannot be debited.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><b> Adding a payment method to the Consumer Account</b></p>
<p>Consumers can register a bank card, of which they are the holder, in the Application in order to use it as a means of payment for payment transactions or to recharge one of their Payment accounts.</p>
<p>Lydia has set up a priority selection mechanism for bank cards issued by the CB group of bank cards. Consumers can override the automatic priority selection by choosing another brand from those displayed as "accepted" by Lydia (see<a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/xjwfni0o3m-we-accept-the-following-bank-cards"> Lydia Manual&gt; Accepted bank cards)</a>.</p>
<p>The deposit account agreement governing the bank card must authorise the transfer of funds by card. The Consumer then receives confirmation of the addition of a payment means under the conditions provided for in Article 18 "Methods of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" &gt; "Communicating with the Consumer".</p>
<p>The Consumer accepts that the data relating to their card is kept by Lydia's technical service providers in charge of debiting and managing user payment cards (service providers responsible for implementing the secure software and protocols required for registration, transmission and secure processing of card fund transfer orders), for the sole purpose of executing their payment transactions or recharging of their Payment Accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><b> Payment transaction</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The Consumer can initiate a payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either as part of a face-to-face payment with the Beneficiary, via a QR code or via Bluetooth (if device is compatible);</li>
<li>Or as part of a remote payment:</li>
<ul>
<li>With the Lydia Application, by selecting the payment beneficiary from the contacts in their directory (which implies that the Consumer has agreed to link the contact directory to the Lydia application) or by entering their telephone number, email address or IBAN number;</li>
<li>With the Lydia Application, by accepting a request for payment issued by another Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service;</li>
<li>With a bank card, outside the Lydia Application, by performing a payment transaction through a CB Form offered by a Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The payment means (Lydia balance, bank card or Bank Account) of the paying Consumer is debited immediately and the Beneficiary's Payment Account, if the latter has a Lydia Consumer Account, is credited upon receipt of confirmation from the Lydia technical service provider in charge of debiting the payment method. The transaction cannot be cancelled either by the payer or by Lydia. Only the beneficiary can, by whatever means, return the funds to the payer (see 15. The responsibility of the Consumer &gt; Final payment order).</p>
<p>Unless the Consumer directly enters the IBAN of the Beneficiary, if the beneficiary does not hold a Lydia Consumer Account, they then receive an SMS or an email inviting them to install the Lydia application or to perform a transfer to their Bank Account by entering their IBAN within seven days. After this period, the transaction is cancelled and the payment means used is re-credited.</p>
<p>When consenting to the execution of a payment, the Consumer selects the payment means they wish to use to debit the funds. The operation can only be carried out if the selected payment means is linked to an account with sufficient funds.</p>
<p>An electronic transaction receipt is sent to the Consumer, under the conditions set out in Article 17 "Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" &gt; "Communicating with the Consumer".</p>
<p>Lydia and the PSP may refuse a payment order. The Consumer will be informed of the reason for refusal the day following the refusal at the latest, unless a national or European provision prohibits it.</p>
<p>The Consumer is solely responsible for the payment transactions they issue. Once a transaction has been carried out and confirmed, the selected payment means is debited. Lydia cannot be held responsible in the event of an error made by the Consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Receipt of funds (collection)</strong></p>
<p>The funds are credited to the Beneficiary's Consumer Account instantly if the latter is a professional or is already a Consumer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Beneficiary is informed of the transaction by SMS or email and can receive funds within seven days:</p>
<ul>
<li>By downloading the Lydia Application;</li>
<li>By making a transfer to the Bank Account of their choice. To do this, the Beneficiary provides their IBAN </li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, after seven days, the transaction is cancelled and the Consumer Account issuing the payment is re-credited.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong><b> Transferring funds to the Bank Account</b></p>
<p>Consumers can, if they wish, transfer all or part of their Lydia balance to the Bank Account of their choice, within the limits set out by the conditions in the Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix. To do this, the Consumer is requested to provide the IBAN relating to the Bank Account to which he/she  wish to make a transfer. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregating their bank to the Application. In this case, they must accept the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Budget Insight General Conditions of Use</span> or the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TINK AB General Terms of Use</span> depending on the bank holding the account. </li>
<li>Directly entering their IBAN in the Application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Consumer Account is blocked, they should refer to the Article 14 "How Lydia ensures the security of its Service".</p>

<p><strong>Gift Card</strong></p>

<h1><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Security</span></span></strong></h1>
<h2>12. What to do in case of loss or theft of the device linked to the Consumer Account</h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as they become aware of the loss, theft or any fraudulent use of the telephone or tablet on which the Lydia Application is installed, the Consumer should either:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">If possible, connect to their Lydia Consumer Account from another phone/tablet and block their Consumer Account manually, from the Security section (4th tab &gt; Security &gt; Block my account). The Lydia Account Consumer will be temporarily blocked;</span></li>
<li>Request the blocking of their Consumer Account via Customer Care Service , without delay, by sending an email to support@lydia-app.com or by phone on 01 82 88 11 69 (Monday to Friday from 9am to 7pm).</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia cannot be held responsible for the consequences of a blocking request which does not come from the Consumer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The unblocking of the Lydia Consumer Account will take place after analysis by our services and in consultation with the Consumer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
<h2>13. What to do in the event of unauthorised or incorrectly executed transactions</h2>
<p>The Consumer must, without delay, notify Lydia of any unauthorised or incorrectly executed operations that they dispute by filling in the appropriate form, and at the latest within 13 (thirteen) months following the date of debit from their Consumer Account.</p>
<p>The dispute of said operations must be made by email or by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt to the addresses indicated in Article 18 hereof.</p>
<p>Once the legitimacy of the dispute has been established, Lydia will reimburse the Consumer, at the latest, on the working day following receipt of the dispute, except in the event of suspected fraud.</p>
<h2>14. How Lydia ensures the security of its Service</h2>
<p><b>Protection of Consumer fund</b><strong>s</strong></p>
<p>The funds of the Consumer are deposited in an account opened with a credit institution in the name and on behalf of the SFPMEI. Thus confined, the funds benefit from the guarantee provided for in article L312-4-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code, up to the amount of 100,000 Euros per Consumer (as provided for in article 5 of the decree of 27 October 2015). which means that all creditor accounts with the same credit institution are added together to determine the amount eligible for the guarantee (subject to the application of the legal or contractual provisions relating to compensation with its debit accounts). The indemnity ceiling is applied to this total (for more information on this point, see the website of the Fonds de garantie des dépôts et de résolution).</p>
<p><strong>Identification through strong authentication</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accessing a Consumer Account</span></p>
<p>When subscribing to the Service, Consumers must register their identifiers on the Lydia Application. Consumers must register two identifiers, their email and their mobile phone number, associated with a password. The Consumer must take all the measures necessary to ensure the security of their tablet or mobile phone and their personalised security device. They must keep their personalised security devices absolutely secret and not communicate them to anyone.</p>
<p>To ensure that passwords are secure, they must respect a certain format. The identifiers allow the Consumer to login when the Application is opened for the first time, when the Application is disconnected and each time a connection is made with a new mobile device.</p>
<p>The combination of one of the two identifiers and the password constitutes the personalised security device made available to the Consumer by Lydia, which is specific to the Consumer and placed under their protection.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the use of the personalised security device is coupled with a single-use password, with the aim of performing strong authentication of the Consumer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performing an operation</span></p>
<p>When using the Application, the Consumer must register a four-digit personal security code. This code must be entered during recharging, payment and reimbursement operations carried out at the request of the Consumer, as well as when consulting sensitive payment information.</p>
<p>By entering and validating their personalised security device and confirming the transaction, the Consumer gives their definitive consent to the payment order. From this moment, the Consumer can no longer revoke their order. It is also at this moment that Lydia receives the execution order, except in the case of a face to face transfer, where the reception of the order occurs during the code scan by the beneficiary of the transfer (see Lydia user manual).</p>
<p>For more information on personalised security devices, the Consumer should consult the Lydia Manual.</p>
<p>Each time they register or enter their personal identifiers, the Consumer must ensure that their environment is secure.</p>
<p>Communications with the Service are made only through secure channels. Lydia does not, for example, ever request the provision of confidential data via a website. If the Consumer has a doubt about the legitimacy of a request relating to the provision of confidential data, it is recommended they do not provide this data and should contact Customer Care Service via the email address support@lydia-app.com.</p>
<p><b>The fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism</b></p>
<p>In application of the provisions of articles L.561-2 and subsequent of the Monetary and Financial Code relating to the participation of financial organisations in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, the Partners in their capacity as electronic money or payment service establishments, ​​digital asset service provider (PSAN) or credit institution and Lydia as PSP Agent, are bound by certain regulations and obligations ​​to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing and against corruption. </p>
<p>As such, Lydia and its Partners . can carry out all the procedures necessary for the identification of the Consumer and the beneficiary (Know Your Customer obligations,). They are also required to exercise constant vigilance over the business relationship, in accordance with applicable laws, and to examine the transactions carried out by the Consumer, ensuring that they are consistent with the current knowledge of the Consumer. In this respect, they may have to set up monitoring systems and, in the presence of transactions that appear to them to be inconsistent or suspicious, unusual or exceptional, to inquire of the Consumer or, where applicable, his or her agent, as to the origin or destination of the funds, the purpose and nature of the transaction or the identity of the person benefiting from it. If they fail to do so, Lydia and its Partners reserve the right not to execute the transaction or to cancel it or to terminate the contractual relationship.</p>
<p>The Consumer also recognises that Lydia and its Partners may issue reports to the competent authorities (Tracfin alerts for the fight against clandestine financial circuits), voluntarily or on request, voluntarily or on request (response to judicial or administrative requisitions).</p>
<p>The Consumer acknowledges that Lydia or its Partners may at any time terminate or postpone the opening of the Lydia Consumer Account, or the execution of an operation in the absence of sufficient information on its object or nature.</p>
<p>In this respect, no prosecution based on article 226-13 of the penal code and no civil liability action can be brought against Lydia or its Partners, their managers or their employees who have in good faith made the declarations mentioned in articles L.561-15 and subsequent of the Monetary and Financial Code.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Politically Exposed Persons</span></p>
<p>As part of its obligations to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, Lydia and its partners are required to apply additional due diligence measures with respect to politically exposed persons (hereinafter referred to as "PEPs"), who are subject to specific regulations due to the particular risks they and/or their close relations face in terms of financial support for terrorism, attempted corruption or the circulation of capital of fraudulent origin for money laundering purposes. In view of this higher risk, Lydia and its Partners are subject, in addition to the due diligence measures provided for any Consumer, to enhanced control and additional due diligence measures at the inception of the business relationship and during the execution of the Service.</p>
<p>Lydia reminds you that a PEP is defined under Article L. 561-10 of the Monetary and Financial Code as: "a person who is exposed to particular risks by reason of the political, jurisdictional or administrative functions that he/she performs or has performed or those performed by direct members of his/her family or by persons known to be closely associated with him/her, or who becomes so during the course of the business relationship".</p>
<p>Consequently, any Consumer corresponding to this definition undertakes to perform all necessary diligence to enable Lydia and its Partners to carry out an enhanced review of the transactions carried out on his/her Consumer Account, to inform them of any exceptional transaction compared to the transactions usually recorded on his/her Consumer Account and to provide them with any document or information required in order to enable Lydia and its Partners to justify compliance with this specific regulation to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International Financial Sanction</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></p>
<p>In the event that: </p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1) The Consumer and, if applicable, the Agent, or the country or territory in which it is located or established, becomes subject to economic or financial sanctions, trade embargoes or similar measures taken, promulgated or implemented by the United Nations, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union or any Member State or any other legal sanction recognized by Lydia or,</p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">In the event of a suspected unauthorised or fraudulent transaction;</span></li>

<h1><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Rights &amp; duties of the Lydia Consumer</span></span></strong></h1>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB"></span></h2>
<h2>15. The responsibility of the Consumer</h2>
<p><b>Veracity of the personal information</b></p>
<p>On request, the Consumer undertakes to provide Lydia and its Partners all the information necessary to verify their identity and their transactions. </p>
<p>The Consumer declares and guarantees that the documents provided to Lydia and its Partners, as well as the information and / or certificates communicated to Lydia and its Partners when opening the account and throughout the duration of the Service, are, on the date on which they were delivered, correct, regular and sincere. Lydia draws the attention of the Consumers to the fact that it is their exclusive responsibility to comply with the legal obligations applicable to them. Lydia can in no way replace him/her in this area. In particular, the Consumer must comply with the tax obligations that apply to him, both in the various countries concerned by his / her transactions or investments concluded with Lydia or through its intermediation and in the country (ies) of his/her nationality or of his/her residence. He/she is committed to ensuring that any transaction carried out with Lydia or through its mediation complies with these laws, in particular in the fight against corruption and in tax matters.</p>
<p>Lydia reminds the Consumer that the use of false documents is punishable under articles 441-1 and subsequent of the Penal Code. Consumers using false documents will be penalised by the closure of their Lydia Consumer Account and will be subject of a declaration and/or a complaint against them filed with the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>In addition, any Consumer providing false information will be liable for the payment of a penalty (see <a href="https://lydia-app.com/en/about/price.html?tab=limit">Pricing &amp; Limits Appendix</a>).</p>
<p><b>Strictly Personal Consumer Account</b></p>
<p>Lydia also reminds Consumers that their Lydia Account is strictly personal. It is strictly forbidden for the holder of the Consumer to lend it or to dispossess it. Any assignment or transfer of a Lydia Consumer Account to a third party is strictly prohibited and will result in the termination of the Consumer's access to the Service by Lydia, without notice.</p>
<p><b>Duty of vigilance</b></p>
<p>When the Consumer makes a payment transaction, whether face to face or remotely, they must ensure the identity of the recipient and verify the amount of the transaction.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the case of remote payment, on the Internet for example, the Consumer must be vigilant in ensuring that the payment platform used by the seller is secure.</p>
<p>Lydia and its Partners are not responsible for any loss due to a technical breakdown of the payment system if such is reported to the Consumer by a message on the device or in another visible manner.</p>
<p><b>Normal use</b></p>
<p>The Consumer undertakes not to use their Lydia Payment Accounts for the purchase of services or products illegal or contravening public order or good morals. In addition, the Consumer undertakes to make normal use of their Consumer Account and Payment Accounts in order to exclusively perform the operations for which the Application is intended.</p>
<p><b>Positive Payment Account</b></p>
<p>The Consumer undertakes to honour any payment order made with their Lydia Payment Accounts. </p>
<p>Before each and every payment or withdrawal operation, the Consumer must systematically ensure that the balance of the Payment Account selected to support the operation is sufficient and available to be able to perform the operation and must stay that way until the operation is completed.</p>
<p>The existence of a dispute between the Consumer and a third party, notably due to the non-conformity of an item or service sold, may not justify the refusal to honour a payment order.</p>
<p><b>Rectification of a negative balance</b></p>
<p>Theoretically, the Consumer Account balance cannot become negative (less than 0). However, the Consumer Account balance may become negative following certain events (cf. Lydia Manual). If such a situation occurs, the Consumer should recharge his account. </p>
<p>The Consumer will immediately be informed of the situation and should recharge his account without delay.</p>
<p>If the Consumer does not recharge his Account within a reasonable delay, the Consumer accepts that Lydia will debit the credit card or payment card connected to the Consumer Account up to the amount required to make the Consumer balance null.</p>
<p>Under the condition provided in the “Communicating with the Consumer” article, the Consumer will be informed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount debited</li>
<li>The credit or payment card concerned ;</li>
<li>The date of the debit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Consumer should make sure that the balance of the account connected to the credit or payment card concerned has sufficient funds.</p>
<p>If he/she wishes the debit to be made on another account, the Consumer must contact the Customer Care Service before the communicated debit date (see Article 18: "Methods of communication between Lydia and the Consumer").</p>
<p>In accordance with Article L111-8 of the Code of Enforcement Procedures, the costs of enforcement, undertaken with an enforceable title, for the recovery of the debit balance are the responsibility of the Consumer. Recovery costs undertaken without an enforceable title remain the responsibility of Lydia. However, Lydia will be able to justify the necessary nature of the steps taken to recover its debt and ask the enforcement judge to leave all or part of the costs thus incurred to be borne by the bad faith debtor.</p>
<p><b>Final payment order</b></p>
<p>Consumers cannot revoke their consent once their payment orders have been received by the beneficiary's service provider.</p>
<p>Consent to carry out a payment transaction is given by Consumers, before or after determining the amount, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entering their confidential code on their phone or tablet;</li>
<li>Remote communication and/or confirmation of the data;</li>
<li>Communication or use of any personalised security data during a payment transaction;</li>
<li>Presenting and holding the smartphone or tablet in front of a device identifying the presence of "contactless" technology;</li>
<li>The use of a biometric recognition device (e.g. fingerprint sensor on the mobile phone).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Consumer provides their banking data as part of a series of payment transactions, they give their consent once for all transactions. The Consumer may however withdraw their consent no later than the working day preceding the execution of a transaction.</p>
<p>In all cases, any Consumer facing bankruptcy cannot revoke their consent to a payment order.</p>
<h2>16. The responsibility of Lydia to the Consumer </h2>
<p><b>Correct execution of payment orders</b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia, in its role as a PSP Agent, is responsible vis-à-vis the Consumer for the proper execution of payment transactions ordered or received via the Service, namely:</span></p>

As such, Lydia cannot be held responsible for any delays in execution that may be caused.</p>
<p><b>Professional secrecy</b></p>
<p>Transactions and personal data are covered by professional secrecy to which Lydia and its Partners are bound. However, this secrecy can be lifted at the express request of the Consumer or with his express authorization on a case-by-case basis or, in accordance with the law and international conventions and this, in particular at the request of the supervisory authorities, the tax or customs administrations, as well as that of the criminal judge.</p>
<p>In accordance with the law, Lydia is also authorized to share professional secrecy for the purposes of business relationship management for the benefit of its service providers and business partners or to third parties during credit transactions, on financial instruments and products, on precious metals, crypto-assets, guarantees or insurance intended to cover a risk associated with a payment account, or in the event of assignments or transfers of receivables or contracts. In addition, the Individual Client authorizes Lydia to share professional secrecy with its partners for marketing and research purposes under the guarantee conditions of its Lydia personal data protection policy.</p>
<p><b>Continuity of service and malfunctions</b></p>
<p>Lydia will make its best efforts to ensure the continuity of the Service. However, Lydia cannot be held liable with respect to the Consumer in the event of a malfunction, error or interruption of the Service as long as it has taken all the necessary measures at its disposal to remedy these malfunctions.</p>
<p>Consumers acknowledge that their access to the Service may be occasionally restricted to allow the correction of errors, maintenance or the introduction of new features or new services.</p>
<p>Consumers must ensure that their equipment is compatible with the Lydia Application and that they have installed the updates necessary for the proper functioning of the Service. The Consumer is personally responsible for the rental or acquisition, installation and maintenance of equipment and the rights to use the software.</p>
<p>The Consumer must have ensured, under his responsibility, the compatibility of his hardware terminal with the Lydia Service and to have installed all the updates necessary for the proper functioning of the Service, available on the application stores. </p>
<p>Although Lydia makes its best efforts to optimize compatibility, it cannot guarantee that the Service will work with all existing terminals. Consequently, Lydia is not involved in any dispute that may arise between the Individual Client and the supplier of the equipment or in the use of fixed or wireless telecommunications networks and their access providers.</p>
<h2>17. Lydia's use of Consumer personal information<span lang="EN-GB"> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia attaches great importance to the protection and respect of privacy of its Consumers. For this reason, a </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy">Personal Data Protection Policy</a> was created to inform the Consumers about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">The way in which Lydia, as data controller, collects, uses and shares the personal data given directly by its Consumers and/or collected indirectly by Lydia during the use of the Service by Consumers;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">The rights of Consumers over their personal data and how to exercise them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">By accepting these T&amp;Cs, the Consumer acknowledges having read and accepts Lydia's </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy">Personal Data Protection Policy</a></span>, accessible at any time on https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In accordance with the legislation relating to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, Lydia is required by the French legislator to keep the below items in transitional archiving (restricted access, transitional stage before deletion) for five years from the closing of the Consumer Accounts of its Consumers, or if no transaction is carried out for twenty-four consecutive months on a Lydia Consumer Account:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Documents relating to the identity of regular or occasional Consumers;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Documents and information relating to transactions made by Consumers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">For more information, the </span>Consumer <span lang="EN-GB">can refer to the</span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/6ogzqxbjos-lydia-personal-data-protection-policy"> Lydia Personal Data Protection Policy</a></span> and to that of its Partners</p>

<h2>18. Methods of communication between Lydia and the Consumer</h2>
<p><b>Communicating with the Consumer</b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When Lydia wishes to pass information to the Consumer, it can use various communication means such as smartphone notifications, notifications in the app, emails or SMS. </span>Consumers can at any time, via the 4th tab in the app, "Preferences", activate or deactivate certain means of communication or the communication of certain information.</p>
<p><b>Contacting the Service to obtain information</b></p>
<p>The Lydia Support service is accessible from Monday to Friday, from 9:00am to 7:00pm:</p>
<ul>
<li>By postal letter addressed to the Customer Care Service at 14 avenue de l’Opéra 75001 Paris France;</li>
<li>By email to support@lydia-app.com.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Contacting the Service for claims</b></p>
<p>Any complaint relating to these Terms of Service for Consumers is to be made by the Consumer to the Lydia Claims Department at the following address:</p>
<ul>
<li>By postal letter: Service Réclamation, 14 avenue de l’Opéra, 75001 Paris France;</li>
<li>By email: support@lydia-app.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help with the rapid processing of claims and with a view to perserve the environment, Lydia prefers to respond to claims by email rather than on paper.</p>
<p>The Consumer agrees to receive registered letters with electronic acknowledgment of receipt, as defined in Article 100 of the Code des postes et des communications électroniques (Post and Electronic Communications Code). This sending will be preceded by an email from the service provider responsible for sending the letter, allowing the Consumer fifteen (15) days to refuse this means of communication.</p>
<p>In the event of a complaint and if no agreement is reached with the Claims Department, or in the absence of a response within fifteen working days, thirty five days if the response is beyond Lydia's control, the Consumer may take the matter to the competent court (see 20. Recourse in the event of litigation &gt; Competent jurisdictions).</p>
<h2>19. Intellectual property </h2>
<p>Lydia grants the Consumer a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable and terminable right to use the Lydia mobile applications, APIs and website for the sole purposes of using the Service. The Consumer acknowledges that the mere use of these mobile applications, APIs and Lydia website does not allow them to claim intellectual property rights of any kind over them.</p>
<p>Lydia retains exclusive ownership of the rights attached to the Lydia mobile applications, APIs and website, as well as all of their content, including the names, brands, domain names, logos or other distinctive signs that it owns. Reproduction of these elements is only permitted for information or reproduction purposes for strictly private use.</p>
<h2>20. Validity</h2>
<p>If any of the provisions hereof is declared null or inapplicable under the law and regulations, it will be deemed unwritten. However, it will not affect the validity or the applicable nature of the other provisions of the Individual T&amp;Cs, and in any event, it will not affect the continuity of contractual relations, unless this clause is likely to modify the subject hereof.</p>
<h2>21. Recourse in the event of litigation</h2>
<p><b>Litigation between a User and a third party to Lydia</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt; text-align: justify;">Lydia is not party to any dispute, even regarding the Service, between a Consumer or Money Pot User and a third party, Professional, Participant, Money Pot Organiser or even distributor of gift card.</p>
<p><b>Burden of proof</b></p>
<p>Proof of the operations carried out on the Payment Accounts by the Consumer is the responsibility of Lydia and results from the accounting entries of the latter, unless proven otherwise by any means provided by the Consumer who is responsible for keeping documentary evidence of transactions (statements of account).</p>
<p><b>Applicable law</b></p>
<p>The law applicable to these Terms of Service is French law. Only the English language version hereof is valid. Lydia and the Consumer agree to use English in their contractual relationships.</p>
<p><b>Amicable settlement of disputes</b></p>
<p>For any dispute not resolved by making a complaint and relating to the management of a Consumer Account, to the execution, non-execution, interpretation, validity and termination of the application hereof, and before any legal action, Consumers are invited to make their complaint directly to the Mediator of the SFPMEI, by post, to the following address: M. le Médiateur de l'Association des Sociétés Financières 24 avenue de la Grande Armée, 75854 PARIS CEDEX 17 or via the website http://lemediateur.asf-france.com/.</p>
<p>Recourse to mediation is a free procedure which is carried out in written form in the French language. The Parties (the Individual Customer and the PSP) may be represented by a lawyer or assisted by a third party of their choice and at their own expense. Each party may seek the advice of an expert at its own expense. </p>
<p><b>Competent jurisdictions</b></p>
<p>In the absence of an amicable settlement within the time limit (cf. Article 18 “Methods of communication between Lydia and the Consumer”) and unless otherwise provided by public order, the competent courts to deal with any dispute between the Parties are the French judicial Courts.</p>
<p>As a consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in these terms and conditions, including this agreement, affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.</p>
