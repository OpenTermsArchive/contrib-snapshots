<b>Security</b>
<br>
GM uses administrative, technical and physical security to protect the personal information we maintain and to help ensure that it is used according to this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies/Tracking Technologies</b>
<br>
GM websites use “cookies” and other tracking technologies to gather information about your visit (such as demographic data, browser type, IP address, pages visited, activities conducted on the page, and the day and time of your visit).
Cookies remember user preferences and maximize the performance of our website and services. Using cookies on our websites provides benefits to you, such as allowing you to maintain your account login information or contact information on Request a Quote forms between visits, or locating a nearby dealer.
In addition, we use information gathered from cookies to autofill fields on forms such as the city, state or zip code associated with your IP address.
This information can be corrected by you before submitting any form or inquiry or you can disable the cookie as discussed below and the information will not be collected.<br>
<br>
Similarly, we may also place Web beacons in our emails to measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns by identifying the individuals who open or act upon an email message, when an email message is opened, how many times an email message is forwarded, the type of software, device, operating system and browser used to deliver the email and any URL accessed through our email message.<br>
<br>
To measure site activity, provide a better user experience, and tailor our marketing communications, we or our service providers or business partners may compile information from the cookies, Web beacons or other technologies on our websites.  This information may be combined with other information collected online or offline about you, including data provided by third party sources, and may be used or shared for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
 We may also allow third party advertising and personalization partners to use this information to develop personalized content and appropriate advertising based on your visits over time on GM web sites and non-GM web sites.  This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not honor “do no track” signals from a web site browser.

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>

A: Your GM telephone and email opt-out preferences will be honored in accordance with applicable law and will remain in effect unless you take action to opt back in to receiving materials from us (for example by Request a Quote or completing a Business Reply Card). Your GM direct mail opt-out preferences will expire three (3) years from the date of your submission.

<br>
Q2: Does my vehicle have a black box to record data?<br>
A: GM vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance.
GM vehicles use on-board vehicle computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the vehicle in difficult driving situations.
Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions.
other information is stored only in a crash event by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR). To learn more about vehicle recording and privacy, refer to the Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy section of your vehicle’s owner manual.</p>
<p>Q3: Does my vehicle have an RFID feature that transmits my personal information?<br>
A: No, many GM vehicles contain sensing and transmitting devices using the same type of radio frequency transmission technology used in RFIDs that can contain personal information.
These devices are used to perform functions such as checking tire pressure.
The devices do not store or transmit personal information. To learn more about vehicle recording and privacy, refer to the Vehicle Data Recording and Privacy section of your vehicle’s owner manual.</p>
