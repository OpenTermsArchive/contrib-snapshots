<strong>What Is Collected:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Part 1- <em>Personal Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Personal Information generally means information that might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include information such as your name, address, age, email and phone number.
This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information that we receive, regardless of how it is gathered or stored.
We collect such Personal Information when you provide it to us or use our services, such as when you:</p>

or</li>
<li>Otherwise communicate with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of the services that we offer require registration as a condition of use.
We may also receive Personal Information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.
For example, our Salesify division may collect information about you from databases provided by its customers, from public sources, or via telephone research efforts.</p>
<p>Please note that Ziff Davis is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in our forums, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile or other areas that allow users to upload or post content.
We discourage users from posting personally identifiable information in this fashion, and any personally identifiable information you post to these areas is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
You can change your publicly available information at any time via your profile page or to request removal of your Personal Information from these areas, please see our section on Updating Your Registration Information in this Privacy Policy.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Please refer to the Terms of Use for our websites for more information.</p>
<p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our emedia web sites in addition to other endorsements and we display personal reviews of products on PCMag.com.
With your consent we may post your testimonial or review along with your name and company.
If you wish to update or delete your testimonial or review, you can contact us at ZDLegal1@ziffdavis.com <strong>and be sure to include “Privacy Policy” in the subject line.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Referrals</em>  If you choose to use our referral service to send an article to a friend, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.
Ziff Davis does not store your friend’s email address.</p>
<p>
<em>Import Contacts</em> You can import contacts from your Outlook or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our website.
We collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and will only use your personal information for that purpose.</p>
<p>
<strong>Part 2-</strong>
<strong>
<em>Other Information That is Collected:</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies</em> are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
Please see our Cookie Policy for more information, including a more in-depth explanation of what cookies are, the different types of cookies used on Ziff Davis sites, and how to change or delete them.</p>
<p>
<em>Log Files</em> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>
<p>
<em>Web Beacons</em> are electronic files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information.</p>
<p>
<em>ETag</em> We and our e-commerce partners, affiliates, or analytics providers, use technologies such as tags to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
<p>
<em>Pixel Tags</em> also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s computer to a third party website.
Used in conjunction with cookies, Ziff Davis may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns.
Pixel tags are also used as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement, and they are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications.
We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose.
We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.</p>
<p>
<em>Local Shared Objects and Local Storage</em>  We use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store user settings and video viewing history.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity also use Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage/HTML5.
To manage Flash Local Shared Objects please click here.</p>
<p>
<em>IP Addresses</em> are a unique string of numbers that identifies each computer attached to the Internet.
We use IP Addresses to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users’ location, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We may connect information about your IP Address to known corporate information and use associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market business-to-business services to the originating corporation or corporations.
IP Addresses that we collect are sometimes linked to personally identifiable information.
We use registration and email addresses that you provide together with IP Addresses and other information that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.
By combining the information, we are better able to understand our users and to better market services and products to our users.</p>
<p>
<em>Device ID (identification)</em> is a distinctive number associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device.
Device IDs are different than hardware serial numbers.
iOS uses the Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) and Android uses Advertising ID.
Some of our apps and mobile sites may create a unique device ID for your smartphone or other mobile device using our own algorithm.
We use Device IDs – either our own, IDFA or Advertising ID- to analyze trends, administer our mobile sites and apps, track mobile users’ location, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We may connect information about a visitor’s Device ID with other information we gather about that visitor as described in this Privacy Policy.
By combining the information, we are better able to understand our users and to better market services and products to our users.</p>
<p>
<em>Mobile Analytics</em> We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
<p>
<em>Third Parties.</em> To improve the quality of some of our services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties, including third party affiliate network operators, referral sources, and social networking sites or services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn).
For example, if you access My IGN (my.ign.com) using a third party connection or log-in (such as Google+, Facebook or Yahoo!), we may also collect your user ID, username or email address associated with that third party service or any information you have made public in connection with that service or the third party shares with us.
In addition, we may use data collected by a third party operator/licensee of localized versions or editions of PCMag.com, IGN.com, or AskMen.com.</p>
<p>
<em>Speedtest—Broadband Performance Data Services.
</em> When using our Speedtest application, we collect test results, approximate location of the server and user machine (using publicly available information and if made available by your mobile device) as well as the network address and the ISP, college or organization that operates the network you test.
The information we collect via the broadband and mobile performance tests run on the Speedtest app, speedtest.net or pingtest.net is done so anonymously and is then aggregated for a few different broadband performance data services.
We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for users around the world.
This anonymous, aggregated data can be accessed via subscription services.</p>
<p>
<em>Offers.com—Merchant Preferences.
</em> When using the Offers.com service, we may collect information that is about you but does not identify you, such as your merchant, brand and coupon preferences, and your interactions with Offers.com and its merchants.
This and certain other information about you as described above (including personal information) may be collected when you: (1) search for merchants, brands or coupons, (2) view, display, click, print or download a coupon.
(3) submit or redeem a coupon to a merchant.
or (4) interact with advertisements appearing on the Offers.com website.</p>
<p>
<em>Social Media Widgets.</em> Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, which include the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.
These features may collect your IP Address, track which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites.
<strong>Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Online Ad Serving.</em> Ziff Davis and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our sites or use our apps.
Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie, pixel tag and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web, app and email advertisement and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or apps, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites.
We will also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.
Ziff Davis and/or these third party advertisers may collect non-Personal Information about you for online behavioral advertising (OBA) purposes- which includes mobile devices and apps- in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising from us in the future but see below – Interest Based Ads- for more information on OBA.
<strong>The specific providers we use are subject to change.</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>What We Provide to Third Parties:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Statistical Reports and Contact Lists</em>. The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience—which are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites—help us sell advertising by, among other things, describing the demographics of our visitors, and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands.
In addition, we make some information collected by our B2B, emedia and Salesify divisions, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer’s name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g.
sale) to third party providers of goods and services when such information is provided in connection with webcasts and white papers or other sponsored downloads.
Please note that we only take such actions in connection with emails collected by PCMag, Toolbox.com, ITtoolbox, Inside CRM, IT Management, IT Security, and Voip-News.
Please see the sections <br>
Webcasts and White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads below to learn more.
To learn how you can make choices about how this information is used or shared, please visit the How You Can Change or Control What is Collected section below.</p>
<p>
<em>Email Deployment, Data Analysis E-Commerce and Other Services</em>. We provide customer lists, email addresses and other information to third party companies and contractors who provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, data and website hosting, and other data and transaction processing.
These companies work on our behalf, and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own permanent use.
Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service.
They should also maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Please note that we engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the sale of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services.
These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
<p>
<em>Webcasts</em>. At times we produce and host sponsored webcasts for a variety of companies (“Sponsors”).
Data collected during the registration process and the actual event may be shared with those Sponsors and others.
The data is governed by our Privacy Policy and the third party’s privacy policy, and it may be used by us and the Sponsor for follow-up purposes.</p>
<p>
<em>White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads</em>. Ziff Davis hosts product listings and offers informational downloads for a variety of third party vendors.
When registration is required in order to receive or view the download, some or all data collected during product registration and/or Ziff Davis website registration may be shared with the vendor (and other third parties) in order to send information related to the topic of the white paper or product download.</p>
<p>
<em>Contests, Competitions, Sweepstakes and Prize Draws</em>. Data collected during the registration for contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws is used by us and may be shared with sponsors and other third party companies involved in administration and prize fulfillment.
Please read the official rules carefully before you submit your personal information.</p>
<p>
<em>Co-Branded Sites and Services. </em>When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ziff Davis), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner.
Use of your information by such partners is subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
<p>
<em>Speedtest Results. </em>We license the results from all tests run through our Ookla brand—including speedtest.net and pingtest.net—to third parties.</p>
<p>
<em>Online Data. </em>All Online Data is collected anonymously as described here.
However, data collected on Speedtest.net is not anonymous as follows: Ookla collects users’ IP Addresses as described in the above section.
Ookla licenses the online data collected on Speedtest.net to various companies around the world, including IP addresses and results from the speed tests taken.
In most cases, the IP addresses are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information.
For some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses for that company’s customers upon request for use in customer insights and assistance.
Ookla may also provide full IP addresses to equipment manufacturers and core network, or wholesale, providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes.
In the cases in which we provide the full IP address, it is because the company, typically an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or mobile carrier, owns those IP addresses and provides them to their customers when their customers enter into a service contract.
Because the company owns the IP address, we provide that full information to those companies when they specifically request that information.See below Interest-based Ads for data that we may sell, license or transfer to third parties.</p>
<p>
<em>Ecommerce</em>. When shopping on some of our sites or pages, users may need to provide personally identifiable information that is necessary to fulfill an online order, including name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card number (with expiration date), and any of the above information needed to send a package to a gift recipient.
If a user creates an account, the credit card information above will not be stored under their account.
When placing an order, credit card information will be immediately entered onto a secure server of a PCI-compliant third party.
We partner with a number of third parties to process and fulfill orders, send transactional emails, collect payment/credit card information and ensure delivery of downloads and packages.
While these third parties may have access to Personal Information in order to perform their duties, they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.
For Offers.com, we may disclose personal information to referral sources to the extent necessary to process and record the referral and to merchants and third party affiliate networks to the extent that you have submitted or redeemed a coupon offered by the merchant or participated in an offer or other activity sponsored or offered through Offers.com on behalf of the merchant, to the extent necessary to process and record the submission or redemption of the coupon and/or to facilitate your participation in the activity.</p>
<p>
<strong>What Ziff Davis does with the Information it Collects</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Personal Information </em>.
 We only use Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected.
How we use personal information is further described in the section What We Provide to Third Parties.</p>
<p>
<em>Emails</em>. We use email addresses to send offers of services or products (and as set forth in the section What We Provide to Third Parties).
Any recipient will be able to unsubscribe from receiving these emails by following the instructions at the bottom of the email.</p>
<p>
<em>Other Information: Ad Serving and Ziff Davis</em>. At times we display ads both on our network of owned and operated websites and apps and on non-Ziff Davis websites and apps.
When you visit one of our websites, use one of our apps or view ads that we serve off of our network elsewhere, you may see multiple kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results and graphical ads shown on web pages and apps.
Sometimes these ads are based on the content of the page on which they appear.
Other times these ads are generated by matching the ad to your interests as inferred from your browsing activities collected online.
or the ads may be based on your location using your IP address and/or browser- see Interest-based Ads below.
Either way, Ziff Davis tries to show you relevant ads, and to do so, we may use information we know or receive about you, such as your browsing habits, gender, location or interests.</p>
<p>
<em>Interest-based Ads</em>. We use cookies, Javascript, pixel tags, Device ID tracking and other technology to collect information about (i) your visit to our sites, your engagement with our apps and other third party partner websites and apps that we do not own or operate but with whom we have agreements and (ii) your interaction with emails we deliver (“Online Data”).
We analyze what pages you visit on our sites and the third party sites, what products or services you view, and whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you.
We use this information to send you interest-based ads.
All such data is also collected anonymously, and is aggregated with other data we collect and/or similar data collected by partners to create segments, groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived from your IP Address or mobile device, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using our sites and services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services.
We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note that we may sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your contact information or other data that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address), which we obtained as described above under Personal Information-however in some situations we combine the Online Data with your email address.</strong>
</p>
<p>We will engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data.
and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
These efforts do not result in the collection of personally identifiable information such as name or address.
and we do not intentionally collect data that we consider to be sensitive, such as financial, health, or medical information or data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or sex life.
Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire.
However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits one of our sites or a partner’s site.</p>
<p>
<em>To allow other users to find you</em>.  In order to locate My IGN Members that a user may already know in the physical world and/or want to get to know in the online world, we allows users to search for members using information the user already knows, such as username, full name, or gamer profile, and identifies users matching that search information.</p>
<p>
<em>To ease future form filing</em>. Some of our services use a registered user’s data to “pre-populate” online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional individual data by our websites, selected third party sites, and/or sponsors and advertisers.</p>
<p>
<em>Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting</em>.  We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites.
Our ad network partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our owned and operated sites and third party websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
Even though we do not disclose your personal information for targeted advertising purposes without your consent, if you click on otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising.
You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
