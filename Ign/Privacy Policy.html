<b>IGN Collected Information</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>IGN Site Activity Information.</b> When users access the IGN Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.
For example, in order to permit your connection to the IGN Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access the IGN Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.
Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.
We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the IGN Services, including your actions while using the IGN Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, advertisements you have seen, as well as other anonymous, non-personally identifiable information.
IGN may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the IGN Sites to personal information obtained from you or a third party.
For example, if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the IGN Sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
However, we will not coordinate your personal information and cookie or click stream information in this manner without first obtaining your express affirmative consent.</p>
<p>Third parties that support the IGN Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
IGN does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies).
Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html.
Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the IGN Services.</p>
<p>
<b>Third Parties.</b> To improve the quality of the IGN Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties.
If you access the IGN Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with partner services.</p> 3.
