It is our objective to take steps reasonably necessary to help secure your information and to treat your information that we have collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.
For example, we collect information when you use our Services, book travel, register for our Services or set up a Southwest account, SWABIZ<sup>®</sup> account, or Rapid Rewards<sup>®</sup> account, subscribe to our e-mails, mobile messages, or social media notifications, post on our forums or blogs, participate in the Rapid Rewards<sup>® </sup>Program, a sweepstakes, contest, promotion, survey, or poll, communicate with us via third party social media sites, shop our Services, order physical or digital gift cards, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us through the Services.</p>
<p>The types of information we may collect include Personal Information.
"Personal Information" is information that could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household, including information that can be used to identify an individual (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, e-mail address, zip code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information, social media account information, travel preferences, birth date, redress number, and demographic information.
“Personal Information” also may include sensitive information, such as present and future health status, and genetic information, to allow us to better serve your needs (for example, to assist you with boarding a flight if you need a wheelchair or with meeting safety requirements).</p>
<p>You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Services, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information that you  submit to us.</p>
<p>If you apply for or inquire about employment with us, “Personal Information” may also include your education, occupation, and employment history.
 This Privacy Policy is not intended to be a substitute for disclosure or authorization obligations regarding background checks, which may be required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar laws.  If we conduct a background check on you, at that time we will provide you with separate disclosure and authorization forms informing you of our intent to check your background, and requesting your consent to do so.</p>

<li>
<em>In-App Tracking Methods: </em>There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.

<br>Back to Top Advertising &amp.
Analytics Services and Online Tracking<p>We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics about the use of our Services.
In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Services visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges.
These entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your use of the Service, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.
This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.
Data collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a non-affiliate for such purposes.</p>
<p>This means that some information about your browsing of the Service and certain third party sites may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on the Services and certain third party sites, and Southwest may receive from some of these companies information about third party sites that you have visited.
This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed "retargeting" to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer.</p>
<p>These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Service.</p>
<p>We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).</p>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit.
There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, Southwest currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.
To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>
<p>Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads.

We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.</p>

Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Southwest in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on our Service in accordance with the terms of the third party website or service.
Also, both Southwest and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Services and the third party site or service.
In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web pages, profile pages, or similar pages on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>
<p>The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy.
The information collected and stored by the third parties remains subject to those third parties’ privacy practices, including whether the third parties continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on those third party websites or services.</p>
<br>Back to Top Refer-a-Friend<p>You may use a referral feature to inform a friend about our services.
Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature to send a single e-mail to such designated recipients about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide news and information we think will be of interest to such designated recipients.
By using a referral feature, you represent that you and your friend are United States citizens and that you have permission to provide your friend’s email address.
Southwest will not be responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.</p>
<br>Back to Top Third Party Websites<p>The Services contain hyperlinks to other websites or locations that we do not control and are operated and controlled by third parties ("Third Party Websites").
We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of such Third Party Websites and encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your Personal Information.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third Party Websites.
You should read the privacy policy of each Third Party Website as these Third Party Websites may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to independently collect information about you.
In addition, these Third Party Websites may solicit Personal Information from you.</p>
<br>Back to Top TSA Guidelines<p>The TSA requires us to request, and you to provide, your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C.
section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560.
