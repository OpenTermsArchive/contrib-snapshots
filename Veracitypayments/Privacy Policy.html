<p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites or Services.
We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>
<p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.
You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).</p>
<p>
<strong>• Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process, or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites and Service.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to do control cookies.
Visitors to our Sites who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function.</p>
<p>
<strong>• Clear GIFs.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of Sites visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Sites usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
<p>
<strong>• Third Party Analytics.</strong> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites and, to the extent permitted, our Application.
We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.
We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.
We do not share your personal information with these third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Links</strong>
<br>
Our Sites and Services may contain links to third-party websites.
Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites.
We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>
<p>
<strong>User Content</strong>
<br>
If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to the public.
We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy</p>
<strong>
<br>
Security of My Personal Information</strong>
<p>We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.
We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to our clients.
You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail.
Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.
