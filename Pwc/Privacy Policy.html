Personal data collected by PwC may be transferred to other individual PwC firms, which are member firms of the worldwide PwC organisation, where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information.
By submitting data on PwC's website, the visitor is providing explicit consent to transborder transmission of data collected on the website for the fulfilment of their voluntary requests.

Typically, identifying information is collected to: Register for certain areas of the site Inquire for further information Distribute requested reference materials Submit resumes Demographic information, including gender and occupation, is not actively sought, but may be submitted when a visitor responds to an online job application.
It is PwC's policy to limit the information collected to only the minimum information required to complete a visitor's request.
In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection.
Although most publications are provided as downloads, visitors may also have the opportunity to purchase PwC publications either online, by calling toll free numbers, or by faxing order forms to our fulfilment houses.
We will collect order information and a customer's credit card information, where applicable, in order to facilitate shipment and payment for the publication.
Visitors are also able to send email through the site.
Their messages will contain the user's screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message.
Because we use the website as a recruiting tool, a visit to the website may also result in the user sending a resume to an individual within PwC.
PwC's intention is not to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting purposes.
Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record.
We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature.
If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, PwC accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.

This data is not shared with other entities in the network for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.
If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.
PwC makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.
If a visitor believes the site has collected excessive information, we encourage the visitor to contact us at privacy@pwc.

Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.
