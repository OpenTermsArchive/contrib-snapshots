<p>
<b>Your choices about collection and use of your information</b>

<b>How we protect your personal information</b>
<br> We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
<p>
<b>Blogs</b>
<br> We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others.
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service.
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>
<p>
<b>Children's privacy</b>
<br> Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>
<b>Visiting our websites from outside the United States</b>
<br> This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States.
If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
<br> We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services.
When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website.
We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>

<b>Cookies:</b>
<br> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes.
Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.
A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site.
When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or account ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer.
We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in.
For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies.
In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier.
We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings.
(Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p>
<p>We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site.
These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites.
They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you.
The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy.
This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.
Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).</p>
<p>
<b>Web Beacons:</b>
<br> Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies.
Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns.
We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>
<p>FAQs for Privacy Policy Changes</p>
<p>
<b>Why has the privacy policy changed?</b>
<br> As of December 1, 2010, we are no longer part of the IAC/InterActiveCorp family of companies.
As of December 1, 2010, Gifts.com joined the Liberty Media family of companies (www.libertymedia.com) and we have updated this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes.</p>
<p>
<b>What changes have been made to the privacy policy?</b>
<br> No, our underlying practices have not changed.
We have simply removed our association with the IAC businesses to reflect our current ownership structure.</p>
<p>
<b>Who are the businesses in the Liberty Media family of companies?</b>
<br> A full list of the Liberty Media companies can be found at www.libertymedia.com.</p>
<p>
<b>Do you/will you sell my personal information to third parties?</b>
<br> No, we wonÕt sell your personal information to third parties.
As described in our privacy policy, we may share your personal information with selected business partners with which we partner to provide you with special promotions, offers, sweepstakes, contests or other activities, when you elect to participate in those offers or promotions.
We may also share personal information in other limited circumstances, including to law enforcement, with your consent or after providing you with the option of not having such information shared.</p>
<p>
<b>To whom does the updated privacy policy apply?</b>
<br> This updated privacy policy applies to all of our website visitors in the United States.
It generally covers the personal information visitors provide to us on this website.</p>
<p>
<b>When do revisions take effect?</b>
<br> The updated privacy policy is effective as of December 1, 2010.
It applies to personal information we collect from this date going forward.</p>
<p>
<b>Will this updated policy apply to the information I have already provided to you?</b>
<br> No, the new provisions of this updated privacy policy will not apply to the personal information you have provided before December 1, 2010.
