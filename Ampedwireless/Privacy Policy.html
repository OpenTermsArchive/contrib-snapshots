You and Amped Wireless agree to the following resolution process.
<br>
<br>
To begin with, you agree that that any claim that you might have against us regarding these Terms of Use or your purchase of any Amped Wireless product or use of that product must be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association using its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of our agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or part of this agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to decide the arbitrability of any claim or dispute between you and Amped Wireless.<br>
<br>
Because we prefer to resolve our issues with you directly, you agree to arbitrate with Amped Wireless only in your individual capacity, not as a representative or member of a class.
As such, your claims may not be joined with any other claims and there shall be no authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or brought by a purported class representative.
<br>
<br>
It is important that you understand that the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If the arbitrator rules against Amped Wireless, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, we will reimburse your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
<br>
<br>
It's important to us that we address any issues you might have promptly.
To help us do that, you agree to begin any arbitration within one year after your claim arose.
otherwise, your claim is waived.
<br>
<br>
Unless you and Amped Wireless agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county where you reside.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
<br>
<br>
If your claim against Amped Wireless is for less than $10,000, Amped Wireless will pay all arbitration fees.
If your claim against Amped Wireless is for $10,000 or more, you are responsible for paying your own portion of the fees set forth in the AAA’s fee schedule for consumer disputes, and Amped Wireless will pay all remaining arbitration fees.
If you believe you cannot afford the AAA’s fee, you may apply to the AAA for a waiver.
<br>
<br>
As an exception to this arbitration agreement, Amped Wireless is happy to give you the right to pursue in small claims court any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction as long as you proceed only on an individual basis.
<br>
<br> We would hope that our customer services agents could resolve any disputes you have with us without resort to arbitration.
Before initiating any arbitration proceeding, you agree to first discuss the matter informally with Amped Wireless for at least 30 days.
To do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern and your proposed solution by mail to us at:<br>
