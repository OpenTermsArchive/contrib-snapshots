In addition to the information you provide, HP may also collect information during your visit to an HP website, or a website “powered by” another company on behalf of HP, through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links.
These tools collect certain traffic information that your browser sends to a website, such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived.
They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier, clickstream behavior (i.
e.
the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with HP websites or “powered by” websites) and product information.

HP also collects information from commercially available sources that it deems credible.
Such information may include your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic/profile data.
The information HP collects from its commercial sources may be used along with the information HP collects when you visit HP’s sites.

For example, HP may use your information to assist you in completing a transaction or order prevent and detect security threats, fraud or other malicious activity communicate with you about products and services provide and improve service and support update you on new services and benefits provide personalized promotional offers select content to be communicated to you personalize some HP websites measure performance of marketing initiatives, ads, and websites “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf allow you to participate in contests and surveys contact you regarding HP products or services.

4.
How we share your information HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement.
HP shares personal information in the following ways: HP retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist HP with marketing and communication initiatives.
These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, marketing, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for HP.
From time to time, HP participates in marketing initiatives with other companies, including websites “powered by” another company on behalf of HP.
As part of these initiatives, certain HP services and marketing communications may be delivered at the same time as those from other companies.
Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both HP and the other companies participating in these initiatives.
For example, you may receive marketing communications from HP and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies.
If you choose to provide personal information only to HP, HP will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative.
If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies, which may differ from HP’s policies and practices.
HP will require the export of your personal information to other HP-owned business entities in the US and Worldwide in accordance with this Statement to satisfy your request.
Such export is a requirement of providing the information to HP.
Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the personal information you provide to HP with non-HP third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity; (iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of HP or its subsidiaries; or (v) protect the rights or personal safety of HP employees and third parties on or using HP property.
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is HP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

We give you a choice regarding delivery of HP general communications by postal mail, email, telephone, and mobile device.
You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data collection point or by using other methods, which are listed in the following sections.
This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, driver updates, or other administrative and transactional notices as the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.

Keeping your personal information secure HP takes seriously the trust you place in us.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, HP utilizes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
HP retains data only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose.
When collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information we use a variety of additional security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
The personal information you provide us is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities which have limited access.
When we transmit highly confidential information (such as credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes.
As part of real-time payment processing, HP subscribes to a fraud management service.
This service gives you and HP an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.

November 2011 How HP uses automatic data collection tools The following sections provide additional information about commonly-used web technology tools.
Cookies A “cookie” is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive.
HP or its service providers send cookies when you surf our site or sites where our ads appear, make purchases, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services.
Accepting the cookies used on our site, sites that are “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf, or sites where our ads appear may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience.
Cookies are typically classified as either “session” cookies or “persistent” cookies.
Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser.
If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.
You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your cookie preferences at the following websites: Microsoft Internet Explorer: http://www.
microsoft.
com/info/cookies.
htm Mozilla Firefox: http://www.
mozilla.
org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_priv_help.
html From time to time, HP will use Flash local shared objects (LSOs) to store Flash content information and preferences.
LSOs perform similar functions to HTML browser cookies and deposit small files on your computer, which are commonly called Flash cookies.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and cookie management tools provided by your browser may not remove Flash cookies.
To learn more about Flash Cookies and how to manage the related privacy and storage settings, please visit the Adobe Systems website .
Web beacons Some HP.
com and third-party Web pages and HTML-formatted email use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email, as well as to measure performance on hp.
com and websites “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf.
A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.
Depending on the context, web beacons may also refer to content on a third-party server, and may be used by service providers to deliver relevant advertising to you.
You may be able to disable Web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer).
However, doing this may not always disable a Web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities.
For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider.
If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from HP as specified in Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences, HP may automatically collect personal information about you.
For example, through Web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, HP can track whether you’ve opened those messages and whether you’ve clicked on links contained within those messages.
For more information on embedded Web links, see below.
Embeded Web links Emails from HP, Internet keyboard keys preconfigured by HP, and promotional icons preinstalled on your PC desktop often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through HP’s servers.
The redirection system allows HP to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.
In emails, such web links may also allow HP to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity.
If you do not want HP to collect information about the links that you click, you can: change your choice about how you receive communications from HP (i.
e.
choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in an email that HP sends delete the promotional icons preinstalled by HP on your PC desktop or choose not to click on those reconfigure the Internet keyboard keys on certain PC models to launch a destination URL of your choice by using the instructions provided with your PC HP ads and offerings on third-party websites HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties.
In addition, some websites may be “powered by” a service provider to provide HP offers on HP’s behalf.
These service providers may send cookies from and use Web beacons on these third-party websites and on hp.
com.
The cookies and Web beacons may enable HP to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.
