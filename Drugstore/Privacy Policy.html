Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive.
Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do tie cookies to a customer member ID which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes.
Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular web site or advertisement).
Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server.

The third party is required to protect the privacy of the information it receives using Web beacons or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us.
In addition, we may use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered (which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened).
This information may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail communications.<br>
<br>
<strong>Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</strong>

Be assured that, in accordance with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer list to third parties.
You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes "harvest" your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses.
If you opt out of receiving e-mail advertisements from drugstore.com, we may share that information with third parties in order to instruct them not to send advertisements on our behalf to you.
If drugstore.com shares opt out information with a third party, we will direct such third party to use this information solely to eliminate potential recipients from any e-mails they send out on our behalf.<br> Please note that all e-mail that originates from us will either display the drugstore.com™ or Beauty.com™ logo (HTML e-mails) or contain the drugstore.com, inc.
or Beauty.com, Inc.
copyright notice (text emails).
