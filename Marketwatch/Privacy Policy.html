Personal Information We Receive from Third Parties We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications.
For example, if you access an Online Service through a third party connection or log-in, such as Facebook Connect, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to us.
This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
Other Information "Other Information" is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as browser information, information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information, and aggregated information.
We may combine Other Information with your Personal Information, and when we do, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.
Other Information You Submit We collect Other Information when you submit it to us.
It may include your gender, education, occupation, financial information (such as your income, investments, portfolio transactions and value, and other information), interests, photos, connections, and comments.

We may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Online Services to Personal Information obtained from you or a reputable third party.
For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or clickstream data about your activities on our Online Services may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
Third parties that support our Online Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect Other Information.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION We use the Personal Information we collect from and about you for the purposes set forth below.
Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.
To improve the quality of our products and services, we may combine the Personal and Other Information we collect with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of other Dow Jones products, services and websites, or information from third parties.

Some Online Services use the information we collect in site-specific ways.
For example: FINS Resume Database.
FINS (fins.
com) offers you the opportunity to create an online profile and store it in our database.
When you create a profile on our system, you can choose one of the following options: (a) you can designate your profile as "Private" which means that your profile will not be shared with employers or recruiters unless you apply directly for a job, or (b) you can designate your profile as "Searchable" which means you allow your profile, including your name and contact information, to be searchable and viewable by employers or recruiters.
IF YOU ELECT TO MAKE YOUR PROFILE SEARCHABLE, ALL INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION) THAT YOU INCLUDE IN YOUR PROFILE MAY BE VIEWED BY RECRUITERS AND EMPLOYERS.

We do not screen the credentials of employers or recruiters before allowing them to conduct searches in our database.
Dow Jones is not responsible for the retention, use or privacy practices of that employer or recruiter after it has received your information.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, third parties who accessed the database or obtained a copy of your resume may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances.
FINS Job Alerts.
FINS offers you the opportunity to sign up for job match alerts.
These matches are generated by comparing a user's profile to our job database using our matching software.
If you would like to review, change or delete your resume or job match alert, you can do so by signing in here and following directions to edit.
To deliver relevant content and recommendations.
To make your experience more interesting and personalized, we may use any of the Personal and Other Information we collect to assist us in delivering content on our Online Services.
