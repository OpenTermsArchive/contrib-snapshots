<strong>The best way to avoid getting tricked by scammers is to know the tricks they use – and the red flags that signal scams.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Know the red flags</strong>
<br>The most common types of scams will target you through fake emails (a technique known as phishing), text messages (SMSishing or smishing) voice calls (vishing), letters or even someone who shows up at your front door unexpectedly.
No matter which technique the scammer uses, you may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressured to send money</li>
<li>Threatened with law enforcement action</li>
<li>Told to purchase gift cards and provide codes as a form of payment</li>
<li>Asked to cash a check for a stranger or send money via wire transfer or Zelle<sup>®</sup>
</li>
<li>Asked to deposit a check that overpays for something you're selling, and then send the difference elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The best ways to avoid getting scammed</strong>
<br>If you provide your information or send money to a scammer, there is often little we can do to help get your money back.</p>Expand all panelsShow all panels | Hide all panelsDon't send gift cards as payment or buy gift cards for someone you don’t know , closed Don't cash checks for strangers or return funds for overpayment , closed Don't provide account or personal information via email or text , closed Never Trust Caller ID , closed Don't give an unsolicited caller or solicitor your personal information or codes , closed Don't pay upfront for a promise , closed Don't click on unsolicited links or attachments sent via email or text , closed Never give an unsolicited caller remote access to your computer , closed Don't wire money without verifying instructions , closed Don't feel pressured to act immediately , closed Don't send gift cards as payment or buy gift cards for someone you don’t know , closed Expand all panelsWhether masquerading as IRS agents, tech-support personnel or the attorney for the grandchild who’s supposedly in jail, criminals pressure their targets to buy gift cards for iTunes, Google Play, Best Buy and other popular retailers — and ask them to provide the code numbers, or PINs, on the back of the cards so they can be redeemed.
Don't cash checks for strangers or return funds for overpayment , closed Expand all panelsIf someone you don’t know wants to pay you by check and asks you to wire some of the money back or give them cash, beware! It could be a scam that could cost you thousands of dollars.
When making a check deposit, remember that Bank of America may give you immediate access to the funds, but the check can still be returned unpaid.
Don't provide account or personal information via email or text , closed Expand all panelsWe will never email or text you requesting you to call or respond with your account number, PIN or access code.
Never Trust Caller ID , closed Expand all panelsScammers may pose as government officials, law enforcement or even Bank of America employees to steal your personal information.
Always validate a person’s organization by calling them back through an official phone number.
Don't give an unsolicited caller or solicitor your personal information or codes , closed Expand all panelsBank of America will never call you or visit your home asking you to verify your account numbers, password or access code.
If you receive a call, text or email, or someone comes to your home asking for this information, don’t give it out.

Don't pay upfront for a promise , closed Expand all panelsScammers may ask you to pay in advance for things like debt relief, credit and loan offers, mortgage assistance or a job.
They may say you've won a prize, but first you need to pay taxes or fees.
If you do, they will probably take the money and disappear.
Don't click on unsolicited links or attachments sent via email or text , closed Expand all panelsScammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving them your personal information.
These messages seem identical to official correspondence.
Check it out first by calling a phone number you trust and talk with someone about the notification.
Don't call phone numbers mentioned in the questionable message.
Never give an unsolicited caller remote access to your computer , closed Expand all panelsScammers may pose as an employee of a large telecommunications company or a technical support provider to tell you that your computer is experiencing technical problems.
They will ask for remote access to solve the problem before demanding that you buy software or pay a fee to fix the computer.
Don't wire money without verifying instructions , closed Expand all panelsUse caution when wiring funds to unknown people or businesses.
Scammers posing as a government official, relative, closing agent or some other trusted source often modify wiring instructions to route your money to the wrong account.
Don't feel pressured to act immediately , closed Expand all panelsScammers typically demand immediate responses and payment.
Sometimes they even threaten law enforcement or legal action.
If you feel threatened or are asked not to provide details to others or your bank about the reason for transaction, it could be a scam.
Always ask us for help.<p>Contact us immediately if you feel you may have been a victim of a scam.</p>
