We may use personal information we have collected or that you have provided to assist our non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps to select bank ads or offers that may appeal to you, display them to you and monitor your responses.

<li>If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.</li>
</ul>Additional InformationAggregation Services<p>Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider").
To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.</li>
<li>You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.</li>
<li>Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.</li>
<li>We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.</li>
<li>If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.</li>
<li>If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.</li>
<li>You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.</li>
</ul>Social Media<p>Bank of America engages with customers on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, YouTube® and LinkedIn®.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.</li>
<li>When interacting with official Bank of America social media pages, Bank of America's privacy notices, Social Media User Terms and Community Guidelines may apply.</li>
<li>Please review the privacy policy for the specific social media service you are using to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may allow certain non-affiliated third party widgets (for example social share buttons) on our sites that enable users to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform.
The non-affiliated third parties that own these widgets may have access to information about your browsing on pages of our Sites and Mobile Apps where these widgets are placed.</p> U.S.

</ul>Additional InformationAggregation Services<p>Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider").
To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.</li>
<li>You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.</li>
<li>Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.</li>
<li>We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.</li>
<li>If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.</li>
<li>If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.</li>
<li>You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.</li>

<li>Advertising Practices layer</li>Advertising Practices<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful.
Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit.
This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising.
If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising.
In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill.
These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
