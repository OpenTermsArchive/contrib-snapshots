<p>Across the United States, Americans replace their mattress in under 10 years</p>
<p>More than 45% of mattress' buyers take into consideration the indication of friends, relatives and/or third part "reviews" in their shopping decision making</p>Welcome to Sleepsys Our belief: "SLEEP better, FEEL better, LIVE better"<p>Mattresses are not exactly a new invention, but you may be surprised to find out how old they are.
According to a 2011 study the earliest known evidence of man-made bedding dates back to the Middle Stone Age and is estimated to be around 77 thousand years old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the centuries, mattresses have evolved in relation to their structure and materials. In the 21st century, however, manufacturers started to assembly cutting-edge sleep technology inside 'dumb' mattresses.
This trend has been creating a new sector in the bedding market, called the smart mattress or smart beds, which solutions and systems are being incorporated along with top premium materials and sensors, to analyze your sleep patterns, provide information about the quality of your sleep, and in some cases, actively improve your sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sleepsys is a direct selling Company which the main objective is to offer "smart", differentiated and high-quality products, as well as solutions that have been designed for well-being and sleep quality improvement to our customers.
We are part of the Tender Sleep, LLC group, whose mattresses are manufactured in the United States (Chicago / IL and Los Angeles / CA), and along with our main partners, we are focused on improving the sleep experience, as well as, developing and selling the concept of special mattresses, using globally recognized therapies (Magnetic Therapy) combined with the benefits of Smart Beds.</p>
