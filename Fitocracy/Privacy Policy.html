</ul> Privacy Policy <p>It is Fitocracy’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website(s).</p> Website visitors <p> Like most website operators...
</p>
<p>Fitocracy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Fitocracy’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Fitocracy’s visitors use its website.
From time to time, Fitocracy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Fitocracy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.</p> Gathering of Personally Identifying Information <p>Certain visitors to Fitocracy choose to interact with Fitocracy in ways that require Fitocracy to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Fitocracy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
In each case, Fitocracy collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Fitocracy.
Fitocracy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p>If you create your Fitocracy account using Facebook authentication, we pull in your birthday, email address, and profile picture if they are available to us from your Facebook profile.
All of these can be changed later in your Fitocracy settings.</p>
<p>When you connect your Fitocracy account to Facebook we store some information (access token, your ID, and the names and IDs of your friends) so that we can find which of your friends are using Fitocracy.
or let you know if they join in the future.
If you choose to disconnect your Facebook account from Fitocracy, which you can do at any time, we delete this information from our servers.</p> Correcting updating or removing information <p>Fitocracy users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time.</p> Links <p>Fitocracy may contain links to other sites.
Our site is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.
When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site.</p> Aggregated statistics <p>Fitocracy may collect statistics about the behavior and attributes of visitors to its websites.
For instance, Fitocracy may monitor and identify the most popular types of user interactions on the Fitocracy site.
Fitocracy may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Fitocracy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p> Protection of certain Personally Identifying Information <p>Fitocracy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Fitocracy’s behalf or to provide services available at Fitocracy’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.
by using Fitocracy’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Fitocracy will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Fitocracy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Fitocracy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Fitocracy, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of an Fitocracy website and have supplied your email address, Fitocracy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Fitocracy and our products.
We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
Fitocracy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
Fitocracy uses cookies to help Fitocracy identify and track visitors, their usage of Fitocracy website, and their website access preferences.
Fitocracy visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Fitocracy’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Fitocracy’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p> Business transfers <p>If Fitocracy, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Fitocracy goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Fitocracy may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p> Privacy Policy changes <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Fitocracy may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Fitocracy’s sole discretion.
Fitocracy encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
