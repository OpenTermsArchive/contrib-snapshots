<strong>1.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</strong>
<p>We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or through the Service.
We use that information to provide the Service’s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations.
Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process.</p>
<p>Please also note:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create a Yelp account, we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such as your full name, email address, zip code, physical address, and other information you may provide with your account, such as your gender, phone number, and birth date.
We may publicly display your first name and last initial, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the registration process, as part of your account profile.
You can modify some of the information associated with your account through your account settings.
If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by flagging it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Public Content:</strong> Your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, Collections, compliments, Ask the Community posts, Yelp Talk posts, and edits to business listing information.
Your account profile (e.g., first name, last initial, city, neighborhood, month and year joined, profile photos and friends) is also intended for public consumption, as is some of your other activity through the Service, like how you vote on other people’s contributions (e.g., useful, funny, cool, helpful, not helpful), which contributions you like, where you check-in or where your friends check-in on your behalf, which contributions or users you follow, and which businesses you bookmark.
You can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your account settings.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Contacts:</strong> You can invite others to join or become your friend on Yelp by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access your contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which individuals you want to invite.
If you allow us to access your contacts, we may transmit that information to our servers long enough to process your invitations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Communications:</strong> When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other users, businesses, and Yelp.
You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Yelp.
For example, if you make a reservation, order food, place yourself on a waitlist, or request a quote from a business through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number.
We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages.
<strong>If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</strong> We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation.
If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed.
Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive.
We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person.
If you are a representative of a business listed on Yelp, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business.
Our calls with you may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Transactions:</strong> If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation or purchase, we may collect and store information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration date), as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions.
This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes.
When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology.
If you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses.
For example, if you make a dinner reservation through the Service and write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your dinner reservation through the Service.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Activity:</strong> We may store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visit, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and reservations, purchases, or transactions you make through the Service.
We may also store information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs and mobile applications.
We may also receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such information in the course of using the Service.
You may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the "Location Services" settings for our applications in iOS privacy settings.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Different Devices:</strong> You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or personal computer) and different platforms (e.g., the Yelp website or Yelp mobile apps).
The information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one Yelp platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all other Yelp platforms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> For residents of the EEA and Switzerland only, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the specific information concerned and the context in which we collect it.
We, however, will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for instance, to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations).
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate our Services, communicate with you in relation to our Services, or for our other legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, to analyze and improve our platform, engage in marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing fraud.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at the address listed below in the “Contact” section.

Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages.
Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use.
Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.</p>
<p>The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:</p>

Notifications Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service.
For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.

THIRD PARTIES</strong>
<p>Third parties may receive information about you as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as we do.
In doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.
We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative,Omniture and Digital Advertising Alliance.
Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.
Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), with third parties in connection with advertising programs and data analytics, including with third parties that help determine the efficacy of such advertising programs by aggregating information they receive from multiple services like the Service.
You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service’s settings.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Content Partners:</strong> We allow third party partners to use and display some of the public content available through the Service, such as your photos, reviews, and other information detailed in Section 1(b) above.

In such cases, please note that the information you provide is being provided to the third party.

(b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public, such as disclosures in connection with Yelp’s Consumer Alerts program.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<strong>4.
CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
<p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly.
You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service.
Yelp users can also use the Find Friends feature to find one another based on their names or email addresses.
You can adjust the settings for this feature in your account settings.
Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service are only private to the extent that both you and the person you are communicating with keep them private.
For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it.
Also, we may access, review, and disclose such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, you have the right to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information.
You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.
Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You also have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.
The Service generally provides you with a reasonable means to view and change your profile information and you can opt-out of marketing communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you or in your account settings.
However, if you have any questions or concerns about the processing of your personal information, you may contact us as outlined in the “Contact” section below.
Please note that the “data controller” responsible for protecting your personal data related to the Service is: (i) if you are a resident of the United States or Canada, Yelp Inc., a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in San Francisco, California.
or (ii) if you are a resident in the EEA or anywhere else outside of the United States or Canada, Yelp Ireland Ltd., a limited liability company established and resident under the laws of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<strong>5.
DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</strong>
<p>You can close your account by clicking here.
We will remove certain public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law.
For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations.
Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings, ratings, or reviews by closing their accounts.</p>
<strong>6.
CHILDREN</strong>
<p>The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us here.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>
<strong>7.
SECURITY</strong>
<p>We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</strong>

We take the privacy of our users seriously and therefore take steps to safeguard your information, including ensuring an adequate level of data protection in accordance with E.U.
standards.
These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection laws.
We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
