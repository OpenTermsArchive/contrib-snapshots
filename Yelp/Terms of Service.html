<strong>Additional Terms for Business Accounts</strong>
<p>Last Updated on <strong>March 29, 2019.</strong>
</p>
<p>The following terms (“<strong>Business Terms</strong>”), in addition to the Terms of Service above, govern your access to and use of your Business Account.
In the event of any conflict between these Business Terms and the Terms of Service, the Business Terms apply.
If you have purchased products or services from Yelp on behalf of your business (e.g., advertising or business tools), the terms of that purchase apply in the event of any conflict with these Business Terms.
Capitalized words used but not defined in these Business Terms have the meanings described in the Terms of Service.
By creating, accessing, or using your Business Account, you are agreeing to these Business Terms and concluding a legally binding contract with Yelp.
You are not authorized to create, access, or use a Business Account if you do not agree to these Business Terms.</p>
<p>Please read these Business Terms carefully as they require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>In the event of any termination of these Business Terms, whether by you or us, these Business Terms in their entirety will continue in full force and effect.</p> 1.
