You assume all risks associated with Your Content, including anyone’s reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability, and any risks associated with personal information you disclose. You represent that you own or have the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of Your Content as described herein.

<p>You may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your Content contains material that is false, intentionally misleading, or defamatory; violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; contains material that is unlawful, including illegal hate speech or pornography; exploits or otherwise harms minors; violates or advocates the violation of any law or regulation; or violates these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Our Right to Use Your Content. </strong>We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including by publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, distributing it, and allowing others to do the same in connection with their own websites and media platforms (“<strong>Other Media</strong>”). As such, you hereby irrevocably grant us world-wide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, assignable, sublicensable, transferable rights to use Your Content for any purpose. Please note that you also irrevocably grant the users of the Service and any Other Media the right to access Your Content in connection with their use of the Service and any Other Media.

Excluded Claims may be brought in court. Any issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision will be resolved by the arbitrator. If any Claim cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision, then only that Claim may be brought in court and all other Claims remain subject to arbitration. Notwithstanding this paragraph, Business Claims, as defined in Section 3 of the Additional Terms for Business Accounts, are governed by that section.</li>
<li>Excluded Claims and Claims that cannot be arbitrated must be brought in court. California law will govern these Terms (to the extent not preempted or inconsistent with federal law), as well as any such Excluded Claim or Claim that cannot be arbitrated, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Excluded Claims and Claims that cannot be arbitrated are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction in, and the exclusive venue of, the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such Claim. </li>

For more information, visit <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or, in the United States, call (800) 778-7879. Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. </li>
<li>Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, Yelp will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. We waive any right to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any non-frivolous arbitration between you and us.</li>

<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Service at our sole discretion, at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice or liability.</li>
<li>Except as otherwise stated in Section 10 above, nothing herein is intended, nor will be deemed, to confer rights or remedies upon any third party.</li>
<li>The Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreement between you and us on such subject matter. The parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any representation made but not expressly contained in these Terms.</li>
<li>Any failure on Yelp’s part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. The Terms may not be waived, except pursuant to a writing executed by Yelp.</li>
<li>If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, then only that provision shall be modified to reflect the parties’ intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</li>
<li>The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Yelp’s prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment by you shall violate these Terms and be void.</li>
<li>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, agency, special or fiduciary relationship exists between you and Yelp as a result of these Terms or your use of the Service. </li>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Last Updated on December 13, 2019.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The following terms (“<strong>Business Terms</strong>”), in addition to the <a href="https://terms.yelp.com/tos/en_gb/20200101_en_gb/">Terms of Service</a> above, govern your access to and use of your Business Account. In the event of any conflict between these Business Terms and the Terms of Service, the Business Terms apply. If you have purchased products or services from Yelp on behalf of your business (e.g., advertising or business tools), the terms of that purchase apply in the event of any conflict with these Business Terms. Capitalized words used but not defined in these Business Terms have the meanings described in the Terms of Service. By creating, accessing, or using your Business Account, you are agreeing to these Business Terms and concluding a legally binding contract with Yelp. You are not authorized to create, access, or use a Business Account if you do not agree to these Business Terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE BUSINESS TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE</strong>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the event of any termination of these Business Terms, whether by you or us, these Business Terms in their entirety will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>REQUIREMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong>
<ol>
<li>In order to access or use the Services, you agree that:
<ol>
<li>you have the authority to act on behalf of the business or businesses associated with or claimed through your Business Account and bind any such business (including any corresponding business entity) to the Business Terms (such business or businesses, your “<strong>Business</strong>”);</li>
<li> your access to or use of the Business Site will only be in your capacity as an authorized representative of your Business; </li>
<li>you will not use the Consumer Site for business activities, including but not limited to flagging reviews or messaging people who have reviewed your Business;</li>
<li>your Business complies with applicable laws and does not offer, advertise, sell, or lease illegal products and/or services;</li>
<li>you grant Yelp a non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free limited license to display your public website on the Services, or allow for its display through iframes or other framing technology;</li>
<li>you agree that we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business, and that our communications (including phone calls) with you may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes;</li>
<li>you understand that we may display health score information for your Business, and may place a Consumer Alert regarding that health score, on the business page for your Business;</li>
<li>you understand and agree that we may share certain aggregate or otherwise deidentified information about your responses to Request a Quote leads with other Businesses, for example, the number of total Businesses responding to the lead and the speed of those responses; and</li>
<li>you understand and acknowledge that non-disparagement clauses in certain consumer contracts, such as clauses that seek to restrict or prohibit reviews (including provisions that penalize consumers for posting reviews) about your Business, are prohibited under California law (Cal. Civil Code § 1670.8) and under the federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (15 U.S. Code § 45b) and you agree that you will not include such clauses in your consumer contracts, or otherwise attempt to enforce non-disparagement or ‘gag’ clauses against consumers under any circumstances. You understand that we may publicly notify consumers, including by placing a Consumer Alert on the business page for your Business, if we have a good faith belief that such clauses are used by your Business.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You represent and warrant that you will not, and will not authorize or induce any other party, to: 
<ol>
<li>offer incentives of any kind, such as discounts, freebies, refunds, gift cards, contest entries, offers, or deals in exchange for the posting of reviews of your Business, or to prevent or remove reviews, and you understand and acknowledge that Yelp, through its Consumer Alerts, may publicly notify consumers about such incentives and other attempts to obtain, prevent, or remove reviews;</li>
<li>solicit or ask for reviews from your customers;</li>
<li>write reviews or vote on Content (e.g., voting user reviews as useful, funny, or cool) for your Business or your Business’s competitors;</li>
<li>pay or induce anyone to post, refrain from posting, or remove reviews, or otherwise attempt to circumvent Yelp’s Recommendation Software (defined below) or fraud detection systems;</li>
<li>attempt to generate automated, fraudulent, or otherwise invalid ad impressions, inquiries, conversions, ad clicks, or other actions;</li>
<li>use any automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access, query or otherwise collect Yelp data, content and/or reviews from the Consumer Site or the Business Site, except as expressly permitted by Yelp (for example, as described at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/robots.txt">www.yelp.com/robots.txt</a>);</li>
<li>use any Yelp trademark or service mark in any manner without Yelp’s prior written consent; or</li>
<li>misrepresent your identity or affiliation to anyone in connection with Yelp.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You understand and acknowledge that Yelp allows consumers to post Content about your Business, including photos, ratings, and reviews. You understand and acknowledge that Yelp employs automated software in an effort to showcase the most reliable and useful reviews while displaying other reviews less prominently (<strong>“Recommendation Software”</strong>). You understand and acknowledge that while Yelp uses its Recommendation Software to identify potentially less helpful reviews, the Recommendation Software may sometimes suppress legitimate reviews or fail to detect illegitimate reviews. You understand and acknowledge that any purchase of advertising or other paid features from Yelp will not influence the Recommendation Software or otherwise allow or enable You, directly or indirectly, to alter reviews or impact whether, where, or how reviews appear on Yelp.
<p><strong>The following Sections 2 and 3 apply if you are a resident of </strong><strong>the United States or Canada only:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY<br /></strong><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY SINCE IT LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF THE YELP ENTITIES TO YOU. FOR CLARITY, THE BELOW APPLIES IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DETAILED IN SECTION 12 OF THE TERMS.<br /></strong>The federal Communications Decency Act (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">47 U.S. Code § 230) </a>limits the liability of interactive computer services, like Yelp, for their role in publishing third-party Content, including consumer reviews. Additionally, anti-SLAPP laws, such as <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/code-of-civil-procedure/ccp-sect-425-16.html">Cal. Civ. Proc. Code  § 425.16</a> in California, may require you to pay Yelp&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees if you attempt to impose such liability on Yelp through legal proceedings.</li>
<li><strong>ARBITRATION, DISPUTES, AND CHOICE OF LAW<br /></strong><strong>FOR CLARITY,</strong> <strong>THIS SECTION GOVERNS ANY BUSINESS CLAIM BROUGHT BY YOU OR YELP. ANY CLAIM NOT SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION IS INSTEAD GOVERNED BY SECTION 13 OF THE TERMS.<br /></strong>Except for Excluded Business Claims, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to: (a) these Terms, or the breach thereof; or (b) your access to or use of your Business Account Business Site; (each such controversy or claim, a “<strong>Business</strong> <strong>Claim</strong>”), shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will issue a reasoned award in writing, including all findings of fact and law upon which the award was made. The arbitrator will not have the power to commit errors of law, and the award may be vacated or corrected through judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction under the California Arbitration Act for any such error. “<strong>Excluded Business Claims</strong>” means Claims related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks) or violations of Section 7 of the Terms of Service (Representations and Warranties).
<p>Business Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. Arbitrations will be held in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose for themselves whether to appear in person, by phone, or through the submission of documents. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FOR ANY BUSINESS CLAIM THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EXCLUDED BUSINESS CLAIMS, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS THE PLACE OF PERFORMANCE OF THESE BUSINESS TERMS.</p>
<p>YOU AND YELP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN BUSINESS CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND YELP AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE BUSINESS CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF A BUSINESS CLAIM IMPLICATES THIS SECTION, AND THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL BY A COURT, SUCH BUSINESS CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR. </p>
