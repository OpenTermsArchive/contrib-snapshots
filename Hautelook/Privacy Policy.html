<strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong> California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties for third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Unless you request us to or consent to us doing so, HauteLook does not sell any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
If you have questions about these practices, please contact us at privacy@nordstrom.com.
California law also provides residents with rights to request access to and deletion of certain personal information, to know whether personal information is shared, and to opt out of the “sale” of personal information.
Some California laws also may define “personal information” differently from this Policy.
To understand how we honor these California rights, to make requests regarding these rights, and to learn more about how California law defines “personal information,” please visit Your California Privacy Rights.
