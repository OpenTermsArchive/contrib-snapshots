The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users' session expires or they return to complete a purchase within that time frame.
For the convenience of our users, we also place a cookie on the users' computer when they log in to our talk forums.
This gives the advantage of not having to log back in when moving between the talk forums and the rest of the site.
We do not link cookies to Personally Identifiable Information.
