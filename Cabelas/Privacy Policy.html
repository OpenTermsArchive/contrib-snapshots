<b>E-mail Customer Service</b>
</p>
<br>Welcome to the Cabela's Online Store.
In order to make you feel comfortable and secure in our online store, Cabela's has taken numerous precautions to guard your security while making purchases online.
Our goal is to make you feel as comfortable shopping here as you would from our catalog or retail showrooms.
For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name and e-mail address (where possible).
<br>
<br>
<b>What personally identifiable information is being collected?</b>
<br> When you visit the Cabela's Web site, in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information.
For example, when you order a product, we may ask you to become a registered user of our site, during which you will be asked for your name, shipping and billing addresses, your e-mail address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information.
If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives, we will also store a record of your request along with your e-mail address.
In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as you computer's IP address and which pages you visited, however that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you.<br>
<br> We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name.
We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.<br>
<br> When you order a gift certificate you are given the opportunity to include the name and a message for the party receiving the gift certificate.
This information is only captured as part of this specific order process and is not stored.<br>
<br>
<b>How is the information being used?</b>
<br> The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested or that we think you might have an interest in.
It is also used to improve the content of our Web site, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our Web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>With whom do we share your information?</b>
<br> In order to operate this Web site and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, we occasionally need to share information with third parties.
We may transmit your personal information to service providers who assist us in processing orders, shipping products to you, processing your payment information, sending you catalogs, conducting surveys, on and offline sweepstakes, processing job applications, sending you e-mails and newsletters, and helping us decide whether to extend credit to you (for example, the Cabela's CLUB Visa card).
We have agreements with these service providers that they will protect your privacy in accordance with our standard Privacy Statement.
Some of those organizations may have their own Privacy Statements which may give you additional protections, so you are encouraged to read those statements when presented to you.
<br>
<br> We use Webtrends, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers (anonymous traffic, and from time to time, individual user activity) on our website.
Webtrends' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services.
They are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
<br> We also use a service provider, Kenexa, for tracking and processing of job applications.

This information is only used in connection with applying for a position at Cabela's Inc.
You may review the Kenexa Privacy Statement or to have your information deleted from the career database, please email "Privacy@Kenexa.com".<br>
<br> We contract with Dotomi to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site.
They will collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services.
They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.
These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on other sites that you visit.
The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.

<b>What information will be disclosed if required by law?</b>
<br> If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request.

It is important to understand that when you participate in online discussions, any information you choose to provide is considered "public knowledge" and it is your responsibility to protect your own privacy.
If you register to use the chat or message board features, we will keep your information private, in accordance with this policy.

<b>What are cookies and how do we use them?</b>
<br> A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on the user's hard drive by a Web site you've visited.
These types of cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration.
Cabela's uses cookies to observe our site visitor's navigation throughout the site.
This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience.
<br>
<br> Cabela's also uses a session cookie, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server, which helps to do things like keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart, and other information.
The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users' session expires or they return to complete a purchase within that time frame.
For the convenience of our users, we also place a cookie on the users' computer when they log in to our talk forums.
This gives the advantage of not having to log back in when moving between the talk forums and the rest of the site.
We do not link cookies to Personally Identifiable Information.

<br>
<br> If you provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic catalogs from us, or other notices containing information about new products and services or upcoming events.
On occasion, we may make our postal mailing address lists available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the Cabela's family of companies.

<b>Security</b>
<br>
<b>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?</b>
<br> Cabela's values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure.
As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Cabela's.
<br>
<br>
<b>Secure Ordering Process</b>
<br>
<br> Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
The Cabela's Web site uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer.
These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server.
Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.
<br>
<br> Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end.
We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks.
Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches.
Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse.
<br>
<br> If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us.
For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 1-800-237-4444.
Our fax number for orders is 1-800-496-6329 (for US/Canada 1-308-254-2200).
Or, send your order to: <br>
<br>
<b>Cabela's</b>
<br>
<b>Attn: Order Processing</b>
<br>
<b>One Cabela Drive</b>
<br>
<b>Sidney, NE 69160</b>
<br>
<br> If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 1-800-237-8888 or e-mail Customer Service.
<br>
<br>
<b>Children</b>
<br> In accordance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without the verifiable permission of a parent or guardian.
If you are under age 13, you are welcome to browse our Web site.
However you are not permitted to use any of the features of our site that require the collection of any personally identifiable information.
If we determine that we have erroneously collected a child's information, we will immediately undertake to delete that data from our records.
