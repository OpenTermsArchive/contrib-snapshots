Softpedia allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Softpedia site.
These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Softpedia site.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks Softpedia to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Softpedia Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as message boards (comments) or forums, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons.
