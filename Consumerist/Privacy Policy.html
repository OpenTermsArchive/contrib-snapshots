 What’s Up With Consumerist? RSS Twitter Facebook The Consumerist You are here: Home / Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Last updated on March 25, 2010 This Privacy Policy applies to the Consumerist web site (located at www.
consumerist.
com or www.
consumerist.
org) and any other web sites (our “Sites” and each individually, a “Site”) owned and operated by Consumer Media LLC (“Consumer Media”, “we” or “us”).
Consumer Media is a non-profit organization and an affiliate of Consumers Union of United States, Inc.
(“Consumers Union”), the independent, non-profit consumer advocacy and testing organization, and publisher of Consumer Reports, whose mission is to work for a fair, just and safe marketplace for consumers and to empower consumers.
To maintain our independence and impartiality, Consumer Media, like Consumers Union, accepts no outside advertising, no freebies, and has no agenda other than the interests of consumers.
Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use the information you provide when you visit our Sites.
This Privacy Policy is part of the Consumer Media LLC User Agreement.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT You can visit our Sites and view our content anonymously.
For certain activities, we collect information about you.
The information we collect falls into two main categories: (1) personal information you voluntarily supply to us to take advantage of certain features of our Sites, some of which may identify you personally, and (2) tracking information we collect as you navigate through our Sites.
Personal Information.
You will need to provide us with personal information if you are interested in obtaining certain information or participating in certain activities.
Personal information we collect may include your email address and a user name and password.
For example, if you wish to subscribe to a newsletter offered by one of our Sites, we ask you to provide your email address.
You may also elect to register to leave comments on particular blog entries of interest.
If we produce a mailing list for a Site to provide mailing list subscribers with relevant information, for example, breaking news, or weekly or daily news round-ups, then users will have to provide a valid email address to sign up for emails from the list.
We may ask mailing list subscribers to provide demographic information, such as geographic location, and to describe their personal interests.
Mailing list subscribers will receive regular emails from our Site.
Most of the time, these emails will contain solely content from Consumer Media, but we may send emails from an affiliated organization, that is, on behalf of Consumers Union or the Consumers Union Action Fund, a non-profit organization that helps work for pro-consumer legislative reform.
To enhance the user experience, we may also provide forums, including message boards, where users can discuss topics of common interest.
To sign up for a forum, users may have to submit personal information, including name, a valid email address and certain demographic information.
You may also provide us with information about other people.
For example, you might submit a person’s name and email address in order to share an online article.
Aggregate information collected through technology When you use our Sites we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the Sites.
None of this information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on Site activity.
For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on a Site or which pages or features get the most attention.
We use this information to make our Sites more useful to you.
Most aggregate information is collected via cookies or other technical methods.
We use cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies for analysis and personalization services, which are described in more detail below.
Cookies: We use “cookies” to store, and sometimes to track, user information in certain areas of our Sites.
Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us.
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
A cookie contains a unique number that allows a Site to recognize your computer.
We use temporary and persistent cookies.
A temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser.
We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit web pages in our Sites.
Persistent cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter that information each time you visit a Site (or Site area) that requires you to sign in.
The Help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely.
However, if you don’t accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of certain features on our Sites, for example, you will not be able to use products or services that require you to “sign in” with a user name and password.
Log Files: We use log files to track usage of our Sites.
Log files track Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and the number of clicks in order to enable us to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ navigation in the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
This data is not linked to any personally identifiable information we collect.
We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.
Web beacons: Our Sites and e-mails may use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons.
We use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) on some of our Sites in conjunction with cookies to compile statistics about Site usage.
Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites.
We use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Sites and to measure the effectiveness of a given Site.
We also use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send visitors to our Sites who have agreed to receive e-mail from us, to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.
These technical methods allow us to make our Sites, and any emails you have agreed to receive, more interesting to you.
You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information.
However, if you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies or Web beacons.
These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to other parties authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.
The following vendors provide services to us and may employ Web beacons on our behalf.
Because Web beacons utilize a cookie that can only be placed and “read” by the third party provider, you should review the privacy policy of each provider to answer any questions you may have regarding its cookie policy as well as other options available to you, such as opting out of its specific cookies.
24/7 Real Media provides us with ad serving, trafficking and reporting services for our Sites.
This visit analysis is facilitated by the use of Web beacons which utilize an 24/7 Real Media cookie.
To view its privacy policy and learn how you can opt out of cookies set to facilitate Web beacon reporting by them, please click here.
Our ads and content on other sites Except for our affiliates, we do not allow third-party ads on our Site.
We may place ads for products and services provided by our affiliates, which include two non-profit organizations: Consumers Union and its various publications and other products, and Consumers Union Action Fund, Inc.
, which works to educate the public about consumer rights and consumer safety issues and to advance consumer protection policies, among other advocacy activities.
Consumers Union may use cookies on our Site, for example, to advertise its products and services.
Consumers Union’s use of cookies is governed by its privacy policy, which is accessible here.
To prevent other sites from placing cookies on your computer, you will need to visit each Web site and use their cookie-removal process or set your browser cookie filter accordingly.
HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED We use the information you provide for the purpose for which it was collected.
We may also use your information to customize your experience.
We may track what online content you are interested in or use aggregate user information to assess general user interest in various products and services.
We do this to focus our communications and provide you content and services we believe may be of interest to you.
We also use the information you provide to ensure compliance with our User Agreement.
If you contact us for help or for additional information about a particular service, we will use the personal information you provide to reply to you.
We may also use the information you provide to send you information and materials produced by us or our affiliates that we believe may be of interest to you, for example, we may send you an email about a consumer protection legislative proposal that Consumers Union Action Fund is supporting before Congress or we may send you information about how to subscribe to Consumer Reports or another Consumers Union publication.
If you prefer not to receive these types of communications, you can opt-out by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the email communication and we will honor your request promptly.
We also use the information you provide about others to enable us to send them the online content you requested, for example, to send an article to a friend.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect to your personal information.
We will share your information only with our affiliates, which include Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine and ConsumerReports.
org, and Consumers Union Action Fund, Inc.
, the affiliate of Consumers Union that helps work for pro-consumer legislative reform.
Except for sharing with our affiliates, and as described below, we will not share, exchange, sell or rent your email address with any other third parties.
Sharing with service providers We contract with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf, including hosting and email distribution.
We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services.
These service providers are restricted from using the information we provide in any way other than to provide services for us and they may not share or resell this information.
Sharing for legal purposes From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.
In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.
We reserve the right to share your personally identifiable information with legal authorities if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or if we determine in our sole discretion that it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, any violations of our User Agreement, or in connection with any safety or security concerns.
Please be aware that if you register as a commenter on one of our Sites and a third party subsequently complains that one or more of your comments breaches our User Agreement (e.
g.
, libels them or infringes their intellectual property rights), then in accordance with our User Agreement, we will make reasonable efforts to contact you and alert you to the situation.
If we are required to by law to disclose your contact information, we will first attempt to contact you to provide an opportunity to respond to such request.
SECURITY We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.

Information use by our employees and agents.
Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information.
Using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, our policies restrict access to personal information only to those employees who need to access it for business purposes.

We will investigate, and, if necessary, take action to halt any violation of the security of your personal information of which we become aware.
Security of Access to Your Online Account Information If you register to engage in certain activities on a Site, you are asked to establish a user name and password.
Providing an email address is optional, but if you forget your password, we can send you an email to the email address you used when you first registered with us that allows you to reset it.
If we do not have a valid email address associated with your user name and password, then you will have to re-register if you forget your user name and password.
We urge you to keep your password confidential and not disclose it to anyone.
