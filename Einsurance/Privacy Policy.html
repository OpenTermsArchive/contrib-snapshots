</p> Introduction <p>This privacy policy applies to http://www.einsurance.com owned and operated by E-Insure Services, Inc..
E-Insure Services, Inc.
("E-Insure"), recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information about our clients and others who visit our Web site.
Within this context, the term "personal information" includes any personally identifying information you provide, whether online or by any other means.
You may give E-Insure personal information when you register for an account or service, or when you communicate with us via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
E-Insure's policy is never to share your personal information with any third party except as you specifically permit or as required by law and only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
We do not sell your personal information to third parties.<br>
</p> Information Collection <p>E-Insure Services, Inc., is the sole owner of the information collected on <strong> einsurance.com</strong>.
E-Insure collects information from our users at the following points on this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Support Requests</li>
<li>Topics &amp.
Editorial Comments</li>
<li>Insurance Quotesli&gt;User Profile Maintenance</li>
<li>User Registration </li>
</ul>User Registration <p>Many of the services available on <strong>einsurance.com</strong> require no registration, and may be accessed anonymously.
Others, such as insurance quotes, require that a user first complete a registration form.
During registration a user must provide a minimal set of identifying information, including the user's name, e-mail address, and zip code.
This information uniquely identifies the user's account with E-Insure Services and enables us to select insurance providers that do business in the user's geographic region.
The user may provide more extensive contact and personal information as well, such as cell phone, fax number, home phone number, height and weight, medical history and personal business affiliation though this is not required.
We will occasionally contact the user via the provided e-mail address regarding the administration of the user's account.
Subject to the user's approval, we may also use this information to contact the user about services on our site about which the user has expressed an interest.</p> Insurance Quotes <p>During the insurance quoting process, we require collecting the user's zip code if it was not already collected from the registration process.  Additionally, for each quote request we may collect a user's email address for the purposes of email notifications related to the status of the quote request submitted by the user.
In some cases, we may collect additional personal information from the user relevant to the product under consideration.
Depending on the nature of the quote, this information may relate to the user's business, demographic, financial, legal, medical, residential, or other history or current status.</p> User Profile <p>E-Insure consolidates all personal information collected about an individual user into that user's User Profile.
Each user has the ability to add, edit, or delete this information at will by logging into your account online and changing this information via your online profile.
Apart from the user, only selected E-Insure employees have direct access to the entirety of this information, in order to facilitate customer service.
E-Insure partners have limited access as required to service insurance quotes requested by the user.
No other party has access to User Profile information, except as the user <em>specifically</em> permits or as required by law.</p> Information Use <p>E-Insure makes use of information collected from our users in a number of ways.
Some of these uses are intrinsic to the operation of the website.
in other words, this website would be unable to fulfill essential functions without access to such information.
Other uses enable E-Insure to provide the best possible customer experience, while still others assist us in formulating business strategy.
The following is a list of the most significant ways in which E-Insure makes use of your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance Quotes </li>
<li>User Profile </li>
<li>Cookies </li>
<li>Log Files </li>
<li>Communications </li>
<li>Sharing </li>
<li>Links </li>
<li>Feedback </li>
<li>Discussion Topics (e Insurance Journal)</li>
</ul>Insurance Quotes <p>E-Insure is in the business of connecting businesses and consumers with insurers and providers of insurance information that can meet their specific needs.
An essential part of the process involves sharing relevant personal information about the user with prospective providers, so that providers can provide an appropriate and useful response.
Our partners receive this information in one of two ways, depending on the type of service requested.
Online quoting engines generally provide their own applications.
In the case where the user has elected to be serviced by an online quoting engine, E-Insure will frame the quote engine's application, meaning that any information entered by the user will pass directly to the partner.</p>
<p>E-Insure generally does not have the option to retain or make use of this information, although in some cases E-Insure can contribute to it (and add convenience for the user) by pre-filling relevant application fields with data from the user's User Profile.
Most E-Insure Partners are insurance agencies that lack the capacity to provide their own online capacities.
When a user elects to be serviced by a human insurance agent, relevant information from the user's User Profile is displayed directly to the user's selected insurance agent.</p> User Profile <p>As described above, a user's User Profile serves as a central repository of all contact and insurance-related data entered by the user.
The user has the ability to add, edit, or delete information from his User Profile at any time.
In addition to user-entered data, the User Profile also contains administrative information such as a running record of E-Insure employee interactions with the user.
This information enables E-Insure's support staff to provide a consistently high-quality customer service experience across its client base, and is not accessible to the user.</p> Cookies <p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by E-Insure and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers.
These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.<br> We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g.
language preference), and for authentication.
Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p> LSOs <p> We use LWe use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information.

These communications fall into two general categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative communications</li>
<li>Targeted announcements</li>
</ul>
<p>Administrative communications are generally one-of-a-kind in nature, and involve specific issues regarding the user's account.
Examples of such communication are registration confirmations and confirmations of e-mail address change.
Users may opt to receive e-mailed communications of new content or products of interest to the user.
Such targeted announcements are strictly limited to users who have opted to receive them.
For example, such communications might announce the publication of a new <em>E-Insure Journal</em> article or the release of a new insurance product in the user's geographical region.
Users who have received such announcements and wish to opt out of them in the future may do so by completing one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Instant Unsubscribe tool or change e-mail settings on your User Profile and Account Registration page</li>
<li>Reply to such e-mail with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line</li>
<li>Send Customer Service request with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line</li>
</ul>
