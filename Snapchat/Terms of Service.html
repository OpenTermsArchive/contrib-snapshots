Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.</p><p>One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets hold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here‚Äôs a big warning:&nbsp;if you lose or forget your Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of Memories. We don‚Äôt offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/">Support Site</a>&nbsp;for more details on passcodes.</p><p>Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account.

We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs.

Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver and Jury Waiver</h2><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND SNAP AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p><p>a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 18 (the ‚ÄúArbitration Agreement‚Äù), You and Snap agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms of the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and <span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span> are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. To be clear: the phrase ‚Äúall claims and disputes‚Äù also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrariness of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p><p>b. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (‚ÄúADR Services‚Äù) (http://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. ¬ß 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum‚Äôs rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p><p>d. Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at http://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/. If Snap is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Snap will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Snap, you will be responsible for the first $100 toward the non-refundable Initial Filing Fee, and Snap will pay the remainder of your Initial Filing Fee and both parties' Administrative Fee.</p><p>e. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum‚Äôs rules and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.</p><p>f. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND&nbsp;SNAP&nbsp;WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and&nbsp;Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and instead elect to have the dispute resolved by a judge.</p><p>g. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement of ADR Services' Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</p><p>h. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set out in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>i. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor&nbsp;Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify&nbsp;Snap&nbsp;in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one) and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: <span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>, Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@snap.com.</p><p>j. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p>k. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap.</p><p></p></div></div><div id="exclusive-venue"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e lmWxTu"><h2>19.

When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights to that content you had to begin with. But, you grant us a licence to use that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.</p><p>For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licencable, and transferable licence to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyse, transmit, and distribute that content. This licence is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This licence includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, other service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services.</p><p>We call Story submissions as ‚ÄúPublic Content" that are set to be viewable by everyone as well as content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Snap Map, or Lens Studio. Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners all of the same rights you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as a worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronise, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content (including the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained therein) in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed. When you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Public Content (including your Bitmoji), you also grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to use the name, likeness, and voice, of anyone featured in your Public Content. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, likeness, or voice are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. The licences granted by you for Public Content continue for so long as the Public Content is on the Services and for a reasonable period of time after you remove or delete the Public Content from the Services (provided we may retain server copies of your Public Content indefinitely).

You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it‚Äôs important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to create a strong password that you don‚Äôt use for any other account. If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please reach out to Snapchat <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/a/hacked-howto/">Support</a>, immediately. Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device‚Äôs settings.

Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.</p><p>One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets hold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here‚Äôs a big warning:&nbsp;<b>if you lose or forget your Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of Memories</b>.

Please go to our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/">Support Site</a>&nbsp;for more details on passcodes.</p><p>Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can‚Äôt promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion.
