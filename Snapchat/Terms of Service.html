Memories</h2><p>Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.</p><p>One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets a hold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning: IF YOU LOSE OR FORGET YOUR MEMORIES PASSCODE, OR IF YOU ENTER THE WRONG ONE TOO MANY TIMES, YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ANY CONTENT YOU SAVED IN THE RESTRICTED AREA OF MEMORIES. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/" target="_blank">Support Site</a>&nbsp;for more details on passcodes.</p><p>Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account.

We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion. And just as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges.</p><p>You may not resell any Memories features.

Arbitration, class-action waiver and jury waiver</h2><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p><ol><li><p>Applicability of arbitration agreement. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.</p></li><li><p>Arbitration rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> as of the date of these Terms or by calling the AAA on 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p></li><li><p>Additional rules for non-appearance arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p></li><li><p>Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;will reimburse you for your filing fee, and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected,&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;will pay that forum’s fees as well.</p></li><li><p>Authority of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp; The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span></p></li><li><p>Waiver of jury trial. You and&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.</p></li><li><p>Waiver of class or consolidated actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration;instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set out in Section 18.</p></li><li><p>Right to waive. Any rights and limitations set out in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</p></li><li><p>Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.

Safety</h2><p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</p><ul><li><p>You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.</p></li><li><p>You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other users’ information.</p></li><li><p>You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent.</p></li><li><p>You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, affect negatively or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Services.</p></li><li><p>You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.</p></li><li><p>You will not solicit login credentials from another user.</p></li><li><p>You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech or incitements to violence.</p></li><li><p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.</p></li><li><p>You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorised to access.</p></li><li><p>You will not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.</p></li><li><p>You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.</p></li></ul><p>We also care about your safety while using our Services.

Your account</h2><p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</p><ul><li><p>You will not create more than 1 account for yourself.</p></li><li><p>You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.</p></li><li><p>You will not buy, sell, rent or lease access to your Snapchat account, Snaps, a Snapchat username or a friend link without our written permission.</p></li><li><p>You will not share your password.</p></li><li><p>You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorised third-party applications or clients.</p></li></ul><p>If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please contact <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/a/hacked-howto/" target="_blank">Snapchat Support</a> immediately.</p></div></div><div id="sgl-memories"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h2>10. Memories</h2><p>Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.</p><p>One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets hold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning:&nbsp;<b>if you lose or forget your Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of Memories</b>. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/" target="_blank">Support Site</a>&nbsp;for more details on passcodes.</p><p>Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things such as an operational glitch or a decision to terminate your account at our end. As we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of the content you save to Memories.</p><p>We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time at our sole discretion. And just as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges.</p><p>You may not resell any Memories features. This means you can’t do something like use Memories to operate your own file-storage or distribution service for other people.</p></div></div><div id="sgl-data-charges-and-mobile-phones"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h2>11. Data charges and mobile phones</h2><p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</p><p>If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.</p></div></div><div id="sgl-third-party-services"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h2>12. Third-party services</h2><p>If you use a service, feature or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we offer jointly with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Neither Snap Group Limited nor&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>&nbsp;is responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.</p></div></div><div id="modifying-the-services-and-termination"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h2>13. Modifying the Services and termination</h2><p>We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. This means that we may add or remove features, products or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand – but this won’t always be possible.</p><p>Though we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.</p><p>Snap Group Limited may also terminate these Terms with you if you fail to comply with these Terms, our&nbsp;<a href="/en-GB/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>&nbsp;or the law, or for any reason outside of our control. And while we’ll try to give you advance notice, we can’t guarantee it. Our right to terminate these Terms means that we may stop providing you with any Services or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p><p>Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Group Limited continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10 and 13–22 of the Terms.</p></div></div><div id="sgl-indemnity"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h2>14.
