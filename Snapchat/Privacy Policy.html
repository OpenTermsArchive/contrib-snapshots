For example, most of our services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Other services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p><p>Of course, you‚Äôll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: don‚Äôt send messages or share content that you wouldn‚Äôt want someone to save or share.</p><p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we‚Äôll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p></div></div><div id="information-we-get-when-you-use-our-services"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h3>Information we get when you use our services</h3><p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you‚Äôve used and how you‚Äôve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific advert for a certain period of time and sent a few Snaps. Here‚Äôs a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p><ul><li><p><b>Usage information.</b> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:</p><ul><li><p>How you interact with our services, such as which Filters you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you‚Äôre using Spectacles or which search queries you submit.</p></li><li><p>How you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Content information.</b> We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</p></li><li><p><b>Device information.</b> We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:</p><ul><li><p>Information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, keyboards installed, language, battery level and time zone.</p></li><li><p>Information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones and headphone connection.</p></li><li><p>Information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address and signal strength.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Device phone book.</b> Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may, with your permission, collect information from your device‚Äôs phone book.</p></li><li><p><b>Camera and photos.</b> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device‚Äôs camera and photos. For example, you won‚Äôt be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</p></li><li><p><b>Location information.</b> When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, mobile towers, Wi-Fi access points and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses.</p></li><li><p><b>Information collected by cookies and other technologies.</b> Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons, web storage and unique advertising identifiers to collect information about your activity, browser and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. For example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant adverts. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device.

On our end, that means most messages ‚Äì like Snaps and Chats ‚Äì sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect they‚Äôve been opened by all recipients or have expired. Other content, like Story posts, are stored for longer. For detailed information about how long we store different types of content, please check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/article/when-are-snaps-chats-deleted">Support Site</a>.</p><p>We store other information for longer periods of time. For example:</p><ul><li><p>We store your basic account information ‚Äì such as your name, phone number and email address ‚Äì and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.</p></li><li><p>We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap ‚Äì like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map ‚Äì we‚Äôll retain that location as long as we store the Snap. Pro tip: you can see the location data we retain about you by <a href="https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata"><u>downloading your data</u></a>.</p></li></ul><p>If you ever decide to stop using Snapchat, you can just&nbsp;<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/a/delete-my-account1">ask us to delete your account</a>.

There may be legal requirements to store your data, and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations or if your account or content created by you is flagged by others or our systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.

For example, most of our services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Other services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p><p>Of course, you‚Äôll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: don‚Äôt send messages or share content that you wouldn‚Äôt want someone to save or share.</p><p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we‚Äôll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p></div></div><div id="information-we-get-when-you-use-our-services"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e gGLgWG"><h3>Information we get when you use our services</h3><p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you‚Äôve used and how you‚Äôve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific advert for a certain period of time and sent a few Snaps. Here‚Äôs a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p><ul><li><p><b>Usage information.</b> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:</p><ul><li><p>How you interact with our services, such as which Filters you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you‚Äôre using Spectacles or which search queries you submit.</p></li><li><p>How you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Content information.</b> We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</p></li><li><p><b>Device information.</b> We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:</p><ul><li><p>Information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level and time zone.</p></li><li><p>Information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones and headphone connection.</p></li><li><p>Information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address and signal strength.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Device phone book.</b> Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may, with your permission, collect information from your device‚Äôs phone book.</p></li><li><p><b>Camera and photos.</b> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device‚Äôs camera and photos. For example, you won‚Äôt be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</p></li><li><p><b>Location information.</b> When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, mobile towers, Wi-Fi access points and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses.</p></li><li><p><b>Information collected by cookies and other technologies.</b> Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons, web storage and unique advertising identifiers to collect information about your activity, browser and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. For example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant adverts. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device.

For example, if you use the Map, we store information about your favorite places for up to 40 days so we can personalise and improve your experience. If location information is associated with a Snap ‚Äì like those saved to Memories or posted to Our Story ‚Äì we‚Äôll retain that location as long as we store the Snap.</p></li><li><p>We‚Äôre constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements.
