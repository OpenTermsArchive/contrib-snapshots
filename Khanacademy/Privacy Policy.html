We established ourselves as a not-for-profit organization so that a for-profit motive will not interfere with our mission of providing a trusted educational resource.

<p>
Our Privacy Notice describes what information we gather from our members and others who visit and use our Properties, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it.
By visiting or using our Properties, you consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Notice.

</p>
Khan Academy collects the following information about you and your use of our Properties: Personal Information.
<p>
When you register for, browse and use our Properties, you may provide to Khan Academy what is generally called “personally identifiable information” or “personal data” (such as your full name, email address, or a photograph of yourself) that can be used to identify you.
At Khan Academy, we call this data “Personal Information”.
</p> Information from Integrated Services like Facebook or Google.
<p>
If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking or integrated service (what we call an “Integrated Service”), such as Facebook Connect or Google, Khan Academy may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account.
You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Khan Academy through an Integrated Service.
If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Khan Academy the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.
</p> Information about your use of our Properties and other User-provided Information.
<p>
We may collect usage information about your use of certain features on our Properties, such as the number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed, and the amount of time spent to complete a problem.
This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.
</p> Information obtained from other Users.
<p>
We make available certain features on our Properties that allow other Users to provide us information about you.
This information may include Personal Information.
Generally, this occurs when parents or teachers provide information relating to a Child User.
For example, a parent may register an account for their child and provide us with certain information, such as the Child’s User name and birthday.
</p> Location Information.
<p> We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region, but we don’t collect the precise geolocation of you or your device.
You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.
</p> Information from Other Sources.
<p> In certain situations, we may obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties or sources other than our Properties.
For example, if you donate to Khan Academy via PayPal, we may obtain your name and mailing address to send a thank you note, or if you apply for a job with Khan Academy via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in your application for that purpose.
If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through our Properties, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
</p> Khan Academy uses this information in the following ways: To enhance our Properties and the services we provide.
<p>
Khan Academy uses the information you provide or that we collect to enhance our relationship with you and to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on our Properties.
Khan Academy, for instance, remembers your recent activity so we can recommend the most appropriate content for you on your next visit.
If you have given Khan Academy consent, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with information about Khan Academy’s features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you.
Under certain circumstances and if we obtain your consent (for example, if you submit a testimonial and agree to make it public), we may post your Personal Information on our Properties.
</p> To understand how you and other Users use our Properties.
<p>
Khan Academy uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends, learning behaviors, and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Properties work and look, and to create new features and functionality.

</p> To enable your participation in Khan Academy partnership arrangements.
<p>
Khan Academy will not share Personal Information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.
You can grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Khan Academy.
In these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties.
</p>
<p>
If you participate in special programs, Khan Academy may collect personal information from you to facilitate those programs.
For example, LearnStorm participants may be asked to provide information related to event logistics and prize awarding and processing (e.g., contact information, dietary restrictions, shirt sizes, etc.), and College Board program participants may provide information regarding study habits and test scores (e.g., the number of hours studied, modules or tests taken, scores earned, etc.).
This information may be shared with our program partners for research or evaluation purposes or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
Khan Academy may send information or offers to you on behalf of these third parties.
For example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in your region and send you an email notifying you of the partnership, we will only share your information with the third party if you opt-in to participate in the contest, and if so, the information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize.
</p> Data Retention.

Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant, or administrative request.
In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.
</p> We may share data in the context of a change of business, including a merger or acquisition.

Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Properties.
</p> Child Users Khan Academy is committed to children’s privacy.
<p>
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Khan Academy.
For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (“Child Users”).
Khan Academy does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our Properties.
If Khan Academy learns that Personal Information of a Child user has been collected on our Properties without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian (“Parent”) and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Properties without your consent, please alert Khan Academy at privacy@khanacademy.org and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.
</p> How children may register for and use our Properties.
<p>
Child Users cannot register for a Khan Academy account themselves.
If a Child User attempts to register for our Properties, Khan Academy will request the email address of that Child User’s Parent in order to seek consent from that Parent.
No information about Child Users is retained during their registration attempt, except the Parent email address for purposes of seeking consent.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Parent, you may provide consent for your child’s registration by first registering yourself on our Properties.
Once registered, you can create a restricted account for your Child User, monitor the data on your Child User’s account, or revoke a child’s permission to use the Properties by deleting the account.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, your child can be registered to use the Properties through his or her school, or through an integration with the Properties that is supported by the child’s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar adults who assist in the educational process (“Coaches”) who have taken steps to obtain parental consent.
Parents always have the option to delete their Child User’s account.
</p> Restrictions on Child Users.
<p>
Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User’s access to certain features that could result in disclosure of Personal Information by the Child User.
A restricted account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Restricted accounts do not include the Child User’s real name or biography section.
only the Child User’s username is displayed </li>
<li> The Parent can edit Personal Information found in the restricted account </li>
<li> The Parent can restrict Child Users from adding Coaches </li>
<li> The profile is not shared publicly, and only the Parent and other permitted Coaches can see the user’s profile </li>
<li> The Child User cannot post to public discussion forums </li>
</ul>
<p>
Some other features of our Properties may, however, permit a Child User to enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal Information that would be visible to other Users.
This may occur, for instance, if a Child User enters Personal Information in answering an exercise problem or creating other projects on our Properties.
If you are the Parent of a Child User, please advise your Child User of the risks of posting Personal information on our Properties or any other online services, as information posted may be used by others without restriction.
</p>
<p>
As a Parent, you can choose to share information about your child as you deem appropriate.
Khan Academy won’t share Personal Information about your child or his/her progress with anyone other than you, your child and any permitted Coaches, unless we receive your permission (or as otherwise noted in this Privacy Notice).
</p>
<p>
As a Parent, you have the ability to control information about your Child User.
To review, update, or delete information collected from your Child User, you can do so in the “Your Children” section within your account.
To refuse future collection or use of your child’s Personal Information, you can delete your Child User’s account or contact us at privacy@khanacademy.org.

</p> California Children’s Privacy Rights <p>
If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a User under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on our Properties.
If you would like to request removal of your or your child’s content or information, please email us at privacy@khanacademy.org for assistance, or you can delete specific information (or delete your or your child’s account) directly.
Please note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be deidentified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.
Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.
</p> Our approach to Data Security Data security is important to you, and to us.
<p>
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.
For example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Properties.
You should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.
</p> We try to ensure that our Properties and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.
<p>
Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Properties.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies.
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
</p> We will notify you electronically or via the Properties if Khan Academy experiences a data security incident that could affect you.
<p>
If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
We may also post a notice on our Properties if a data security incident occurs.
</p> How we maintain data integrity <p>
At Khan Academy, we only use Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of Personal Information relating to you.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
If you discover that Personal Information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact us as outlined below.
</p> Links to other sites <p>
The Properties may link to and may be linked by websites operated by other entities or individuals.
Some of these websites, such as the Khan Academy Facebook page, may be co-branded with our name or logo.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot always control the activities of, such other third-party websites.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third-party websites.
</p> International visitors <p>
Our Properties are operated and managed on servers located within the United States.
If you choose to use our Properties from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S.
law, then you acknowledge and agree that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States and that, by providing your Personal Information on the Properties, you consent to that transfer.
</p> Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice <p>
Khan Academy may modify or revise this Privacy Notice from time to time.
Khan Academy will notify Users of any changes to our Privacy Notice by posting the revised Privacy Notice with an updated date of revision on our Properties, along with a short notice of the revision posted on our homepage.
We will not change how we use any Personal Information in any material way without also providing notice of the change via email to you (or in the case of a Child User, to your Parent) or through the Properties, and obtaining consent to any new uses.
