</p>
<p>Your PII will be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies, to fulfill your request and to provide other products and services to you.</p>
<p>In addition, if you provide your PII through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services or dealer communication services (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services"), your PII will be shared with vehicle dealers, and may also be shared with the vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and contractors, who may use that information to contact you.
In addition, if the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service you use is "co-branded" (<em>i.e.</em>, the page or screen on which it appears displays the name of both Edmunds and one of our partners), your PII may be shared with that partner.
Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies or other entities, distributors, agents, contractors or partners use your PII.</p>
<p>If you use the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services to call, email, text or chat with a dealer, or if we otherwise act as an intermediary through which communications between a dealer and you are transmitted, a recording of your conversation, or the email, text or chat communications, between you and that dealer (as well as the phone number or email address from which you make such call or initiate such email, text or chat communications), will be made available both to us and that dealer (unless we choose to shield your email address or certain other information from that dealer), as well as any company requested by us or the dealer to facilitate those communications (including any social media website or application from which you initiate a communication).
When we receive that phone number or email address, we may use it to obtain or associate additional information about you, and we may provide that additional information to the dealer and/or those other companies.
In addition, that recording or email, text or chat communication, that phone number or email address, and that additional information, may be provided to vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and contractors.</p>

<p>In addition, we may disclose whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, without first providing additional notification to you or obtaining your consent: (a) to third-party service providers that provide advice, products or services to us, or that assist us to improve our products, services or information, or to better understand their value to our visitors or to the companies with which we do business or are considering doing business.
(b) in connection with any merger or acquisition of Edmunds or its parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by Edmunds to another entity.

<p>From time to time, we may also receive information requests for, and disclose to third parties, portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used or other visitor information.
that information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.</p>
<p>
<strong>Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
</p>
<p>In certain locations on the Edmunds Automotive Network where we obtain your PII, we may include a "check box" (or another process) for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive promotional and marketing communications and/or other information from other entities selected by us.
By providing your consent (such as by "checking" the box, or leaving the box "checked"), you are agreeing to receive promotional and marketing communications from those other entities, and you are consenting to our providing your PII to those other entities.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive promotional and marketing communications from us or our partners, you may do so (i) if you are an Edmunds Insider, by modifying your  profile, (ii) if you received a promotional or marketing email from us, by following the link for that purpose located at the bottom of the email, or (iii) by sending a request to us through our Contact Us form.
However, withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that previously received your PII to continue to send communications to you and otherwise use your Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you are an Edmunds Insider, we may send you certain administrative and service messages in connection with the products and services available to you.
you cannot opt out of receiving those communications, except as may be otherwise required under the CCPA or other United States law.</p>

<strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong>

<p>The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet.
Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.</p>
<p>The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate Web sites, for the purpose of using such data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors.
(The Program does not apply to a Web site's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a Web site.)</p>
<p>Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online services.</p>
<p>In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable Web site usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other Web sites and online services.

These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across Web sites and online services.</p>
<p>Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one.
