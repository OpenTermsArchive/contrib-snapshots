CONFIDENTIALITY.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, each Party will protect each other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use each other’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information (a) solely to the employees and/or non-employee service providers and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by terms of confidentiality intended to prevent the misuse of such Confidential Information.
(b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction.
or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation.
The provisions of this Section 3.1 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties and such agreement shall have no further force or effect.

<strong>3.2</strong> The Zendesk Group will maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Service Data, as described in the Agreement, the Supplemental Terms entitled, “How We Protect Your Service Data” attached hereto, and Supplemental Terms for the Deployed Associated Services, as applicable.
Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure of Service Data by Personnel except (a) to provide the Services and prevent or address service, support or technical problems.
(b) as compelled by law in accordance with Sections 3.1(b) or 3.1(c).

<p>
<strong>3.3</strong> To the extent Service Data constitutes Personal Data, You and the Zendesk Group hereby agree that You shall be deemed to be the data controller and the relevant entity in the Zendesk Group Party shall be deemed to be the data processor as those terms are understood under the Applicable Data Protection Law.
Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Zendesk, Service Data may be hosted by the Zendesk Group or their respective authorized third-party service providers in the United States, the EEA or other locations around the world.
In providing the Services, Zendesk will engage entities within the Zendesk Group and other authorized service providers, to Process Service Data, including and without limitation, any associated Personal Data pursuant to this Agreement within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories.
Under no circumstances will any entity in the Zendesk Group be deemed a data controller with respect to Service Data under Applicable Data Protection Law or any relevant law or regulation of any Member State as defined in Applicable Data Protection Law.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> If Personal Data originates from an Agent or End-User in the EEA, We will ensure, pursuant to Applicable Data Protection Law, to the extent that any Service Data constitutes Personal Data, if Service Data is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), such transfer will only take place if: (a) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection.
(b) one of the conditions listed in Article 26(1) of Directive 95/46/EC (or its equivalent under any successor legislation) is satisfied.

or Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks.
Upon Your request and subject to Your entry into Zendesk’s DPA, We will further ensure that the transfer is subject to the standard contractual clauses designed to facilitate transfers of Personal Data from the EEA to all third countries that have been adopted by the European Commission (known as the, “Model Clauses”), which have been incorporated into the DPA.
As a Subscriber, You can execute Our DPA by emailing Your request to Us at privacy@zendesk.com.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.5</strong> You agree that the Zendesk Group and the third-party service providers that are utilized by the Zendesk Group to assist in providing the Services to You shall have the right to access Your Account and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Service Data to the extent necessary to provide or improve the Services, including, without limitation, in response to Your support requests.
Any third-party service providers utilized by the Zendesk Group will only be given access to Your Account and Service Data as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services and will be subject to (a) confidentiality obligations which are commercially reasonable and substantially consistent with the standards described in Section 3.2.
and (b) their agreement to comply with the data transfer restrictions applicable to Personal Data as set forth in Section 3.4.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.6</strong> Whenever You, Your Agents or End-Users interact with Our Services, We automatically receive and record information on Our server logs from the browser or device, which may include IP address, “cookie” information, and the type of browser and/or device being used to access the Services.
“Cookies” are identifiers We transfer to the browser or device of Your Agents or End-Users that allow Us to recognize Agent or End-User and their browser or device along with how our Services are being utilized.
When We collect this information, We only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify Your Agents or End-Users personally.
For example, this aggregate data can tell Us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and We can use that knowledge to improve the Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.7</strong> We receive and store any information that You knowingly provide to Us.
For example, through the registration process for Our Services and/or through your Account settings, We may collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, phone number, credit card information and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for third party sites that integrate with the Services as further detailed in Section 3.9) of You and Your Agents.
In addition, We may communicate with You and Your Agents.
For example, We may send You and Your Agents product announcements and promotional offers or contact You and Your Agents about Your use of the Services.
If You or an Agent does not want to receive communications from Us, please indicate this preference by sending an email to privacy@zendesk.com and provide us with the name and email address of each Agent that no longer wishes to receive these communications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.8</strong> We never sell, rent, or lease Your Service Data to any third party.
We do not share Your Service Data with third parties, except as permitted by Section 3.5 of this Agreement and in order to provide and support the Services.
We may, however, share aggregated and anonymized information regarding Your use of the Services with third parties as described in this Section.
To be clear, we would never disclose aggregated and/or anonymized information to a third party in a manner that would identify You as the source of the information or Your Agents or End-Users personally, as an individual.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.8.1</strong> Zendesk Benchmark.
You have the choice whether to enable (i.e., opt-in) Zendesk Benchmark from within the settings in the Services.
If You do not wish to participate in Zendesk Benchmark then You should not enable Zendesk Benchmark.

<p>
<strong>3.8.2</strong> Improving the Services.
The Zendesk Group uses third party analytics providers in the following ways for the purpose of assessing and improving the usage of our Services.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Usage Data.</strong> Third party analytics providers may collect metrics information regarding Your use of the Service(s), including evaluating how Agents and End-Users use the Services (“Usage Data”).
To be clear, although Usage Data may be derived from aggregated and anonymized Service Data, it does not include actual Service Data or Personal Data.
Usage Data is used to compile reports on activity within the Services for the Zendesk Group to improve the Services.
The third party analytics providers will not share or otherwise disclose Usage Data, although We may make Usage Data publicly available from time to time.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Anonymized Data.</strong> We may anonymize the Personal Data of your Agents or End-Users so they cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to third party analytics providers for analysis.
We will use this information to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Service(s) and to personalize the user experience.
The third party analytics providers will not share or otherwise disclose this information.
</li>
<p>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>3.9</strong> Zendesk may also obtain other information, including Personal Data, from third parties and combine that with information We collect through Our Services such as in the case where You use a Third Party Service or where we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if You log into Our Services through such service or otherwise provide Us with access to information from such service.
Any access that We may have to such information from a third party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service.
By authorizing Us to connect with a Third Party Service, You authorize Us to access and store Your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other Personal Data that the Third Party Service makes available to Us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Agreement and the Zendesk Privacy Policy as in effect from time to time and available here.</p>

<strong>6.
BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.1</strong> Unless otherwise indicated on an Order Form or SOW referencing this Agreement or in the Supplemental Terms, and subject to Section 6.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of a Service (“Subscription Charges”) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or, with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed.
If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or other charges indicated on any Order Form within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.2</strong> If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade.
In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.3</strong> No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan.
Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.4</strong> Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”).
You are responsible for paying Taxes, except those assessable against the Zendesk Group measured by its net income.
We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.5</strong> If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g.
upon card renewal).
The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status.
You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred.
If applicable, You hereby authorize Zendesk and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish such prepaid credit.
You agree to promptly update Your Account information with any changes (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.
The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.6</strong> Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Zendesk Service are billed and processed by Zendesk’s Payment Agent.
To the extent the Payment Agent is not Zendesk, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.7</strong> If You mandate Zendesk use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal which charges Zendesk a subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required cost of doing business, You shall be invoiced by Zendesk for, and You are obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
PROMOTIONAL CREDITS POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>We may, at Our sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Services in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns and referrals for Zendesk services such as training.
Zendesk reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion.
Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by You to offset Your subsequent payments of Subscription Charges for the applicable Service.
Credits may only be applied to Subscription Charges due for the Service specifically identified by Zendesk when issuing the credit.
Credits can only be used by You and are non-transferable.
To the extent that You have been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.1</strong> Either Party may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to a Service as of the end of Your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with this Agreement, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term.
Unless Your Account and subscription to a Service is so terminated, Your subscription to a Service (including any and all Deployed Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term.
Unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to a Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services to which You have subscribed or which You have deployed, as applicable, as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.2</strong> No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.3</strong> Except for Your termination under Section 8.5, if You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Sections 8.4 and 8.5, in addition to other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term.
This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by Zendesk, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to Zendesk and afford Zendesk no less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach as provided for in Section 8.5 herein.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.4</strong> We reserve the right to restrict functionality, suspend or terminate the Services (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Agents’ or End-Users’ rights to access and use the Services, and remove, disable and quarantine any Service Data if We believe that You, Agents or End-Users have violated this Agreement.
This right includes the removal or disablement of Service Data in accordance with Our Copyright Infringement Notice and Takedown Policy available at www.zendesk.com/company/trademark-property/DMCA/.
Unless legally prohibited from doing so, We will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions.
We shall not be liable to You, Agents, End-Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Services.
Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Agents or End-Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.5</strong> A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the breaching Party’s receipt of such notice.
or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
If this Agreement is terminated by You in accordance with this section, We will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.
If this Agreement is terminated by Us in accordance with this section, You will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all applicable Order Forms.
In no event will termination relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.6</strong> Upon request by You made within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, We will make Service Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation.
After such 30-day period, We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Service Data, and, as provided in the Documentation, will have the right to delete or destroy all copies of Service Data in Our systems or otherwise in Our possession or control, unless prohibited by law.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES AND CONSULTING FEES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF WE WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN.

or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service(s) with other hardware or software where a Service would not by itself be infringing.</p>

To the extent that You have or are required to prepay for expected usage of Zendesk Talk, Your credit card will automatically be charged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when You first establish a prepaid credit for Zendesk Talk, or by such additional amount You request as a regular prepaid credit.</p>
