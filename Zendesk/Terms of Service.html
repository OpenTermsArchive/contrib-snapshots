You may extend Your rights, benefits and protections provided herein to Your Affiliates and to contractors or service providers acting on Your or Your Affiliates’ behalf, provided that You remain responsible for Your and their compliance hereunder.</p>
<p>
<strong>SECTION 2.
USE OF THE SERVICES</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.1</strong> Login Management.
Subject to any limitation on the number of individual Agents available under the applicable Service Plan(s) to which You subscribed, or applicable Deployed Associated Service, access to and use of the Services is restricted to the specified number of individual Agents permitted under Your subscription to the applicable Service.
You agree and acknowledge that each Agent Login shall only be used by one (1) designated individual Agent.
You further agree and acknowledge that an Agent Login cannot be shared or used by more than one individual, but that Agent Logins may be reassigned to new individuals replacing former individuals who no longer require ongoing use of the Services.
You and Your Agents are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Agent Login information for Your Account.
Absent a written license from Zendesk expressly stating otherwise, You agree and acknowledge that You may not use the Services, including but not limited to the API, to circumvent the requirement for an individual Agent Login for each individual who (a) leverages the Services to interact with End-Users.
(b) Processes data related to interactions with End-Users.
or (c) Processes data related to interactions originating from a Non-Zendesk Service that provides functionality similar to functionality provided by the Services and which would, pursuant to this Agreement, require an individual Agent Login if utilizing the Services for such interaction.
Should Zendesk discover that Your use of a Zendesk Service is not in compliance with this Agreement or the Service Plan features and limitations on Our Site, Zendesk reserves the right to charge You, and You hereby agree to pay for, said usage in addition to other remedies available to Us.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2</strong> Compliance.
As between You and Zendesk, You are responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by Agents and End-Users and for any and all activities that occur under Your Account, which Zendesk may verify from time to time.
Without limiting the foregoing, You are solely responsible for ensuring that the use of the Services to store and transmit Service Data is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations You may maintain or enter into with Agents or End-Users.
You also maintain all responsibility for determining whether the Services or the information generated thereby is accurate or sufficient for Your purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3</strong> Content and Conduct.
In addition to complying with the other terms, conditions and restrictions set forth below in this Agreement, You agree to the Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy available on Zendesk’s Policies and Procedures Website, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.
Further, in Your use of the Services You agree not to (a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time-share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Services available to any third party, other than authorized Agents and End-Users in furtherance of Your internal business purposes as expressly permitted by this Agreement, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk.

(g) use the Services to store or transmit files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content that infringes on any person’s intellectual property rights.
(h) use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services and its components.
(i) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any Software making up the Services.

(k) use the Services to store or transmit any “protected health information” as defined in 45 C.F.R.
160.103 provided that You are a “business associate” or “covered entity” as defined in 45 C.F.R.
160.103, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk.
(l) use the Services to knowingly post, transmit, upload, link to, send or store any Malicious Software.
(m) use or launch any automated system that accesses a Service (i.e., bot) in a manner that sends more request messages to a Service server in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online web browser.
or (n) attempt to use or use the Services in violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.4</strong> System Requirements.
A high-speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Services.
You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Your network to the Services, including, but not limited to, browser software that supports protocols used by Zendesk, including the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zendesk, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols.
We are not responsible for notifying You, Agents or End-Users of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data, including Service Data, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities (including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Zendesk.
We assume no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this section.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.5</strong> Internal Business Purposes Only.
Unless otherwise authorized by Zendesk in this Agreement or expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk, You may not use the Services in any manner where You act as a service bureau or to provide any outsourced business process services on behalf of more than one (1) third party (other than Affiliates) through a single Account.
For the avoidance of doubt, this section means You may not resell or outsource the Service(s) except as expressly authorized by Zendesk.

Unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to a Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services to which You have subscribed or which You have deployed, as applicable, as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2</strong> Cancellation.

<strong>3.3</strong> Mutual Termination for Cause.
A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the breaching Party’s receipt of such written notice.
or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p>If this Agreement is terminated by You in accordance with this section, We will refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>If this Agreement is terminated by Us in accordance with this section, You will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all applicable Order Forms.
In no event will termination relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> Payment Upon Termination.
Except for Your termination under Section 3.3, if You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term, or if We terminate or cancel Your Account pursuant to Section 3.3, in addition to any other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.5</strong> No Refunds.
Except for Your termination rights under Section 3.3, if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term, no refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.6</strong> Export of Service Data.
For thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, upon Your request, We will make Service Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation.
Thereafter, We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Service Data, and, as provided in the Documentation, We will, unless prohibited by law or legal order, delete Your Service Data in Our Services in accordance with Our Data Deletion Policy available on Zendesk’s Policies and Procedures Website.</p>
<p>
<strong>SECTION 4.
BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.1</strong> Payment and Billing.
All Subscription Charges are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or, with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, an Order Form, a Statement of Work, or in Supplemental Terms, or as otherwise agreed for Usage Charges.
You are responsible for providing valid and current Account information and You agree to promptly update Your Account information, including payment information, with any changes that may occur (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date).
If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or other charges indicated on any Order Form within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2</strong> Upgrades.
If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term, any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such upgrade will be charged in accordance with the remaining Subscription Term.
In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such upgrades.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3</strong> Downgrades.
You may not downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents under any Service Plan during Your Subscription Term.
If You desire to downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents under any Service Plan for a subsequent Subscription Term, You must provide Zendesk with thirty (30) days advance written notice prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term.
Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.4</strong> Taxes.
Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any Taxes.
You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against the Zendesk Group measured by its net income.
We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.5</strong> Payment Agent.
If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g.
upon card renewal).
Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Zendesk Service are billed and processed by Zendesk’s Payment Agent.
You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services, and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred.
If applicable, You hereby authorize Zendesk and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish prepaid credit.
The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status.
To the extent the Payment Agent is not Zendesk, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service.
The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.6</strong> Payment Portals.
If You mandate Zendesk use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal which charges Zendesk a subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required cost of doing business, You shall be invoiced by Zendesk for, and You are obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.7</strong> Promotional Credits.
Any promotional credits issued hereunder will be subject to the Zendesk Promotional Credits Policy available on the Zendesk Policies and Procedures Website.</p>
<p>
<strong>SECTION 5.
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>Each Party will protect the other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each Party protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information (a) solely to the employees and/or non-employee service providers and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by terms of confidentiality intended to prevent the misuse of such Confidential Information.
(b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction.
or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation.
The provisions of this Section 5 shall control over any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties and any such non-disclosure agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to the exchange of Confidential Information after the execution of this Agreement.

Performance of Consulting Services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Each SOW or Order Form will include reasonable details about Consulting Services, including, at a minimum, the Consulting Fees (defined below) charged and the Consulting Services provided.

Subscriber agrees to provide, at no cost to Zendesk, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Zendesk to enable the performance of the Consulting Services (collectively, “Assistance”).
Zendesk, including its Subcontractors, will not be liable for any deficiency in the performance of Consulting Services to the extent such deficiency results from any acts or omissions of Subscriber, including, but not limited to, Subscriber’s failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> In performing the Consulting Services, Zendesk will utilize Consulting Services Personnel as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof.
Subscriber may object to Zendesk’s use of a Subcontractor by specifying its reasonable objection to Zendesk, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Consulting Services Personnel to perform such Consulting Services.
Zendesk may replace Consulting Services Personnel in its normal course of business, provided that Zendesk will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Consulting Services Personnel.</p>
<p>

<strong>3.7</strong> In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW or Order Form (including, but not limited to, any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW or Order Form), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk.

Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&amp;M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties.

Upon receiving such amended T&amp;M Estimate, Subscriber will accept or reject the amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T&amp;M Estimate within five (5) business days of delivery, such amended T&amp;M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Consulting Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Any amended T&amp;M Estimate which is accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3</strong> As detailed in the applicable SOW or Order Form, the performance of Consulting Services may be subject to an advance payment of Consulting Fees by Subscriber upon execution of the SOW or Order Form.
