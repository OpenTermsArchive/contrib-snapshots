Further, Subscriber shall not use the API or any Software in such a way to circumvent applicable Service Plan restrictions or Agent licensing restrictions that are enforced in the Service user interface.
Should Zendesk discover that Your use of a Zendesk Service is not in compliance with this Agreement or the Service Plan features and limitations on Our Site, Zendesk reserves the right to charge You, and You hereby agree to pay for said usage in addition to other remedies available to Us.</p>

All Subscription Charges are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or, with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, an Order Form, a Statement of Work, or in Supplemental Terms, or as otherwise agreed for Usage Charges.
You are responsible for providing valid and current payment information and You agree to promptly update your Account information, including payment information, with any changes that may occur (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date).
If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or other charges indicated on any Order Form within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2</strong> Upgrades.
If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term, any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such upgrade will be charged in accordance with the remaining Subscription Term.

You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services, and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred.
If applicable, You hereby authorize Zendesk and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish prepaid credit.

or (z) the combination, operation or use of the Service(s) with other hardware or software where a Service would not by itself be infringing.

Unless otherwise agreed to in a SOW or Order Form, Subscriber agrees that any Consulting Services purchased by Subscriber must commence within six (6) months of the execution of the SOW or Order Form.
In consideration of the foregoing, Subscriber and Zendesk, intending to be legally bound, agree to the terms set forth below.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Scope.</strong> All Consulting Services provided by Zendesk to Subscriber and all deliverables required to be provided by Zendesk to Subscriber pursuant to the Agreement (“Deliverables”) will be outlined in one or more mutually agreed-upon and jointly executed SOWs or Order Forms, each incorporated into the Agreement and describing in detail the scope, nature and other relevant characteristics of the Consulting Services and Deliverables to be provided.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Retention.
</strong> Subscriber hereby retains Zendesk to provide the Consulting Services described in one or more SOWs or Order Forms, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.
Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any Consulting Services until both Parties have mutually agreed upon and executed a SOW or Order Form with respect to such Consulting Services.
After execution of a SOW or Order Form, the Consulting Services to be provided under that SOW or Order Form may only be changed through a change order mutually executed by the Parties (“Change Order”).</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Performance of Consulting Services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Each SOW or Order Form will include reasonable details about Consulting Services, including, at a minimum, the Consulting Fees (defined below).
Zendesk and Subscriber agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Consulting Services in a timely and professional manner.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2</strong> The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.3</strong> Zendesk will perform the Consulting Services through qualified employees and/or non-employee contractors of Zendesk (“Subcontractors” and together with Zendesk’s employees for the purposes of these Supplemental Terms, “Consulting Services Personnel”).
Subscriber agrees to provide, at no cost to Zendesk, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Zendesk to enable the performance of the Consulting Services (collectively, “Assistance”).
Zendesk, including its Subcontractors, will not be liable for any deficiency in the performance of Consulting Services to the extent such deficiency results from any acts or omissions of Subscriber, including, but not limited to, Subscriber’s failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> In performing the Consulting Services, Zendesk will utilize Consulting Services Personnel as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof.
Subscriber may object to Zendesk’s use of a Subcontractor by specifying its reasonable objection to Zendesk, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Consulting Services Personnel to perform such Consulting Services.
Zendesk may replace Consulting Services Personnel in its normal course of business, provided that Zendesk will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Consulting Services Personnel.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.5</strong> Zendesk will control the method and manner of performing all work necessary for completion of Consulting Services, including but not limited to the supervision and control of any Consulting Services Personnel performing Consulting Services.
Zendesk will maintain such number of qualified Consulting Services Personnel and appropriate facilities and other resources sufficient to perform Zendesk’s obligations under the Agreement in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.6</strong> Consulting Services Personnel may enter (“assume into”) Subscriber’s production Account to provide the Consulting Services as provided for in Zendesk’s Customer Controlled User Assumption Policy found at: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/%20115001753608-Granting-Zendesk-temporary-access-to-your-account.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.7</strong> In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW or Order Form (including, but not limited to, any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW or Order Form), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk.
If Zendesk elects to perform such changes to the Consulting Services, the Parties shall work together in good faith to execute a written Change Order.
Zendesk shall be entitled to an adjustment in Consulting Fees pursuant to the changes reflected in the Change Order.
Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any differing or additional Consulting Services unless the Parties have mutually agreed upon a written Change Order.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.8</strong> Unless otherwise agreed to in a SOW or Order Form, for Consulting Services that are Deliverable or milestone based, upon delivery of all Deliverables or completion of all milestones detailed in the SOW or Order Form, Zendesk shall provide Subscriber with written notice (“Completion Notice”).
Thereafter, Subscriber shall have five (5) business days from the date of the Completion Notice to provide Zendesk with written notice describing any Deliverables that have not been provided or milestones not met.
The SOW or Order Form shall be deemed complete and the Deliverables accepted or milestones met absent Subscriber’s timely written notice of any Deliverables not having been provided or milestones not having been met.
In the event that Subscriber provides timely written notice of any Deliverables not having been provided or milestones not having been met, Zendesk shall make commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the defects identified.
If the defects cannot be remedied, Subscriber may terminate the applicable SOW and Zendesk shall return the portion of the Consulting Fees paid to Zendesk by Subscriber for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services (or, if Consulting Fees have not yet been paid, Subscriber will be relieved from its obligation to pay Consulting Fees for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services).
For the avoidance of doubt, a Completion Notice shall not be necessary for Consulting Services that are time and materials based.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
Consulting Fees.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.1</strong> Subscriber will pay Zendesk the fees to provide the Consulting Services as detailed or described in an Order Form or SOW (the “Consulting Fees”).</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2</strong> All Consulting Services will be provided on either a time and materials or fixed-fee basis, as indicated in the applicable SOW or Order Form.
Each SOW or Order Form providing for time and materials based Consulting Fees will contain a detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (“T&amp;M Estimate”).
Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&amp;M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties.
If it appears that the T&amp;M Estimate may be exceeded, Zendesk will make a reasonable effort to notify Subscriber as soon as practicable and provide an amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Upon receiving such amended T&amp;M Estimate, Subscriber will accept or reject the amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T&amp;M Estimate within five (5) business days of delivery, such amended T&amp;M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Consulting Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Any amended T&amp;M Estimate which is accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3</strong> As detailed in the applicable SOW or Order Form, the performance of Consulting Services may be subject to an advance payment of Consulting Fees by Subscriber upon execution of the SOW or Order Form.
Such retainer will be applied against Consulting Fees which become payable by Subscriber.
Zendesk may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such advance payment is paid to Zendesk.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.4</strong> In addition to any and all Consulting Fees, Subscriber will reimburse Zendesk for any reasonable expenses for travel, lodging, communications, shipping charges and out-of-pocket expenses, including changes to travel and accommodations resulting from Subscriber’s request incurred by Zendesk in connection with providing the Consulting Services (“Expenses”).
Zendesk will provide reasonable documentation for all Expenses as requested by Subscriber.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.5</strong> Any unpaid Consulting Fees or Expenses will become overdue thirty (30) days after payment is due and shall be subject to a late fee of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month for each month where payment is not received.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.6</strong> Cancellation/Changes: Any cancellations of or changes to the Consulting Services less than five (5) business days prior to the agreed upon Consulting Services commencement date are subject to forfeiture of Consulting Fees paid and reserved date(s).</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
Relationship of the Parties.</strong> Zendesk is an independent contractor and will maintain complete control of and responsibility for its Consulting Services Personnel, methods and operations in providing Consulting Services.
Zendesk will never hold itself out as an agent, subsidiary or affiliate of Subscriber for any purpose, including reporting to any government authority.
The Agreement will not be construed so as to create a partnership, other joint venture or undertaking, or any agency relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall become liable for any representation, act or omission of the other Party or have the authority to contractually bind the other Party.
Any Consulting Fees, Expenses or other amounts paid by Subscriber to Zendesk hereunder shall not be considered salary for pension or wage tax purposes and neither Zendesk nor its Consulting Services Personnel will be entitled to any fringe benefits, including sick or vacation pay, or other supplemental benefits of Subscriber, unless otherwise required by law.
Subscriber shall not be responsible for deducting or withholding from Consulting Fees or Expenses paid for Consulting Services any taxes, unemployment, social security or other such expense unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
Warranties.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.1</strong> Zendesk hereby represents and warrants that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Consulting Services provided pursuant to the Agreement will be performed in a timely and professional manner by Zendesk and its Consulting Services Personnel, consistent with generally-accepted industry standards.
provided that Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty will be, at Zendesk’s option, re-performance of the Consulting Services or termination of the applicable SOW and return of the portion of the Consulting Fees paid to Zendesk by Subscriber for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services.
and</li>
<li>it is under no contractual or other restrictions or obligations which are inconsistent with the execution of the Agreement, or, to its best knowledge, which will interfere with its performance of the Consulting Services.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>6.2</strong> The Parties hereby agree that:</p>
<p> EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.1 ABOVE, ALL CONSULTING SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES ARE PROVIDED TO SUBSCRIBER “AS IS” AND ZENDESK MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS TO SUBSCRIBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION, OPERATION OR FITNESS THEREOF AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING CONSULTING SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATIBILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY.
ZENDESK SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, IN LAW OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY DELIVERABLES DESPITE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, IN THE EVENT THAT SUBSCRIBER MODIFIES ANY DELIVERABLES IN A MANNER NOT INSTRUCTED BY ZENDESK.
ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SUBSCRIBER’S OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE DELIVERABLES SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY.
FURTHER, ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT OR MAINTAIN ANY DELIVERABLE AND WILL NOT DO SO UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY IS EXPRESSLY MADE IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMERS MADE BY ZENDESK OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER THE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AS APPLICABLE TO SUBSCRIBER AND ANY THIRD PARTY’S USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
Rights to Deliverables.
Ownership.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.1</strong> The Parties hereby agree that the specified Consulting Services to be completed pursuant to any SOW or Order Form primarily involve the configuration of Subscriber’s subscription to a Service and integration of Subscriber data with and into one or more Services, and therefore the Deliverables are inoperative without an active subscription to a Service.
As between the Parties, Zendesk shall solely and exclusively own all right, title, and interest in the Deliverables (other than Assigned Deliverables, as defined below), including all derivatives, enhancements and modifications thereof.
and Subscriber hereby makes all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Zendesk grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Deliverables (other than Assigned Deliverables) solely in connection with Subscriber’s permitted use of the Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.2</strong> An “Assigned Deliverable” is a Deliverable created by Zendesk in connection with the Consulting Services that is specifically identified as being assigned to Subscriber in an SOW, excluding any Zendesk Background IP that may be incorporated into such Deliverable.
“Zendesk Background IP” means inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information, tools and other intellectual property owned by Zendesk that are incorporated into an Assigned Deliverable and, (a) in existence prior to the commencement of the Consulting Services or (b) developed, created, conceived or reduced to practice by Zendesk not in connection with the applicable SOW.
Subject to payment of the applicable Consulting Fees for the applicable Assigned Deliverable, (i) Zendesk hereby assigns title to such Assigned Deliverable to Subscriber, and (ii) to the extent any Zendesk Background IP is incorporated into such Assigned Deliverable, Zendesk grants to Subscriber a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to use and exercise such Zendesk Background IP in connection with such Assigned Deliverable.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.3</strong> A “Subscriber Contribution” is source code that is created by Subscriber in connection with the Consulting Services and is specifically identified in a SOW.
Subscriber and Zendesk agree that Subscriber retains title to Subscriber Contributions, and Subscriber hereby grants Zendesk a non-exclusive license to use and exercise the Subscriber Contributions for the performance of the Consulting Services and Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
Open Source.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.1</strong> Zendesk may incorporate open source materials into any Deliverable or Assigned Deliverable.
Zendesk will notify Subscriber that it is providing such open source software upon or prior to delivery, and Zendesk will avoid providing any open source materials that are governed by a so-called “copyleft license” that would require Subscriber to permit any disclosure of, distribute or make available any of Subscriber’s proprietary software if Subscriber uses the Deliverables or Assigned Deliverables as permitted hereunder.
Any open source materials provided by Zendesk are licensed to Subscriber pursuant to the terms of the applicable open source license and not this Agreement.</p>
