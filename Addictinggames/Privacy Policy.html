The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.
Please visit <strong>Online Tracking and Advertising</strong> for further information regarding the collection and usage of your personal information, including how to disable cookies.

<strong>D.
Computer Information Collected By Others:</strong> Defy uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit the Defy Sites.
The Defy Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Defy Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Defy Sites ("Targeting Services").
These Targeting Services enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Defy Sites and other websites you have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products and services that may interest you.
Targeting Services also help prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain advertisements.
</p>
<p> These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Defy Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Defy Sites.
The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.
In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Defy Sites collect.
</p>
<p> You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet.
The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Defy Sites.
Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
We encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties.
</p>
<p> With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers (and outside the control of the Defy Sites), you have a number of options:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You can opt-out of the use of information for these advertising purposes by DoubleClick by using those Providers' opt-out tools.
You can access DoubleClick's at <strong>http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/</strong> .
We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers to collect Information on the Defy Sites.
Some
of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the <strong>Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool</strong>
and/or the <strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong>
<strong>.</strong> Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>The opt-out tools discussed above are "cookie based."</em>
</strong> This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices.
If you opt-out but then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<em>Opt-outs are browser-specific.</em>
</strong> This means, for example, that if you opt out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the collection of information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same device.
It also means that opting out on one device will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use to access the Defy Sites.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You also can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular device by using the controls in your Web browser.
To do so, you must complete both of the following steps: </li>
</ul>
<p> 1.
Delete existing Tracking Technologies through the "Internet Options" sub-option of the "Tools" menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature.
and
</p>
<p> 2.
Disable future Tracking Technologies by using the same browser controls.
Additional information on disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature.

</p>
<ul>
<li> You may be able to set the device you use to access the Defy Sites to warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings.

Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers' Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers' Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Defy Sites.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH COOKIES TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR BROWSER.

</li>
</ul>
<p> Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
</p>
<p> We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
Instead, as set forth above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described above in Section I(C).
</p>

Visitors must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages.

<strong>C.
Third Parties/Advertisers.</strong>
</p>
<p> Defy uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit the Defy Sites.
Some Defy Sites partner with outside third parties to provide you with additional content, products, or services that we believe may be of interest.
For example, we may partner with a greeting card company, software manufacturer, social media plugin provider, mobile phone provider or cable television service provider to offer you electronic cards, games, social networking, text messaging services or customized video content.
These partners operate websites and services that are separate and independent from the Defy Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy policies.
If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you grant the Defy Sites permission to give your registration and other information, including e-mail address, to that third party.
If you have identified yourself as residing in the EU, we will not share your email address or other personally identifiable information with third parties for advertising purposes unless you have "opted-in."
</p>
<p> In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to gather information about you.
Please see Section I(D) above for more detailed information regarding such use of Tracking Technologies.
