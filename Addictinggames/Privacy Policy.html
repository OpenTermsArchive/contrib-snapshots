We and our clients and partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content.
We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (for example, to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date or social security number.
Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.

</p>
<p> WHAT ARE "COOKIES" AND "WEB BEACONS" AND HOW DO WE USE THEM? </p>
<p> The Defy Sites may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services.
A "web beacon" is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content.
We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us so you donât have to re-enter it each time you visit the Defy Sites.
By showing us how and when visitors use the Defy Sites, "cookies" and "web beacons" allow us to see which Defy Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior.
In addition, "cookies" will allow us to display in your profile which Defy and affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account.
We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors.
Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies." We do not control these "cookies." You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use "cookies." </p>
<p> Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies." If youâd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies." You will not be able to fully use the Defy Sites if you turn off the "cookies" option.

Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers.
If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online.
In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.
If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy.
We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
