<ul>
<li>Registration information.
To create a Mendeley Web account, you must provide your first name, last name, email address, password, field of study and academic status.
If you choose to register by using a third party account (such as your Facebook account), the Service will collect the “Third party account data” described below and then ask you to provide a password, your field of study and your academic status to complete your registration.</li>
<li>Profile information.
After you create an account, your first name, last name and field of study will appear in your public profile on which you can post additional biographical information and material, including your CV, and identify any public groups in which you participate.
You can choose how much of your information, if any, you want other people to see by changing the privacy levels in your account, except that your first name, last name, field of study and public groups will remain visible and cannot be made private.</li>
<li>Articles and papers.
If you enter your Mendeley Web account login details when you complete your registration for the Mendeley Desktop software, the publications and papers you catalogue, access, read and manage using the software will be uploaded to your account.</li>

By participating in groups, you may communicate with other users and post annotations and comments.
You may request further services or information, provide feedback, submit questions or report problems by contacting us through web forms, which may request additional information.</li>
