Introduction<br>
App Chronicles takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using this web site.
This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as “data” below) that may be collected by this site.
This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the site editor, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of the site editor, or that are not under the site editor’s control.</small>

Collection of data<br>
Registration for an account or posting comments on this site requires only a valid e-mail address, a user name that has not been chosen already and your name.
You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to.
Please be aware that your name, the user name you choose, the e-mail address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party).
As on many web sites, the site editor may also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information.
Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if it is indeed the site editor’s policy to display advertising) is set forth below.</small>
