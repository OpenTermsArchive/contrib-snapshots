All changes shall be effective immediately when we post them and shall apply to all access to and use of our Website and Services thereafter. Nothing in this Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits hereunder.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="II">II. User Accounts</h2>

You also agree not to create additional User Accounts for the purpose of abusing the functionality of our Website or to seek to pass yourself off as another user. You agree that you will not solicit, collect or use the login credentials of other We Heart It users. You are responsible for all Content that is Posted to our Website or through the Services using the User Account we provide to you, as well as any other activity originating from the User Account we provide to you. We reserve the right to deny registration of any individual and to deny access to our Services to any individual, and to modify or terminate the Services, in each case, for any reason, with or without notice and at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in the User Account we provide to you.</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> Suspension and Termination of Account and Service. Generally, a User Account will be considered active until we receive a user request to deactivate or delete it. We reserve the right to limit, suspend, terminate, modify, or delete (i) the User Account we provide to you or (ii) your access to our Services or portions thereof (including any Content you or other users submit) for any reason, with or without notice and at any time, including, without limitation, if you are, or we suspect that you are, improperly using the Services, violating any applicable laws or failing to comply with this Terms of Service (including, without limitation, the "prohibited actions" set forth in Section VI below).

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="III">III. General Terms</h2>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> You are responsible for your use of our Services, for any Content you Post using the Services, and for any consequences or liability arising therefrom. As part of the Services, you will be provided the opportunity to contribute inspirational Content to the We Heart It community ("Hearting"). You can Heart Content by (i) uploading Content from your computer to our servers or (ii) if you have downloaded and installed our web browser extension and/or bookmarklet, by clicking on the Heart icon in your web browser and selecting the Content you want to Post to our Website through the Services. Please note that other users of the Services will be able to view any Content you Heart. In addition, if another user ReHearts (as defined in Section V(B)) any Content you Post, such Content will become part of such other user’s profile and will be available to such other user and anyone wishing to view or ReHeart such ReHearted Content even if you later decide to remove the Content from your own user profile. As such, you should only provide Content you are comfortable sharing under this Terms of Service.</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> The Services may include advertisements targeted to users, Content or queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by us on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for us granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that we and our third-party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored Content or commercial communications as such.</p>
    <p><strong>C.</strong> The Services that we provide are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>
    <p><strong>D.</strong> You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Services, whether online or offline. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="IV">IV. User Posted and Third Party Content</h2>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> We do not review new Content prior to it being Posted on our Website or through the Services. By Posting Content to our server, you guarantee us that you have the right to make this Content available for use in accordance herewith. You further agree that Content you Post to the Services will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party rights (including rights relating to publicity and privacy), unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to Post the material and to grant We Heart It all of the license rights granted herein.</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> Any use or reliance on Content Posted using the Services or obtained by you through the Services, including any Content you Reheart, is at your own risk.</p>
    <p><strong>C.</strong> We do not guarantee, support or represent the completeness, reliability, truthfulness or accuracy of any Content appearing on our Website or the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content you may find offensive, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, deceptive or in some cases, mislabeled. We expressly disclaim any liability for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions within any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content Posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>D.</strong> The Services may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Functionality of the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and third-party applications or features, including applications that connect the Services or your profile with a third-party website or feature. For example, the Services may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Services or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party’s service or application. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party website, service, feature or application. In addition, we will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party website, service, feature or application. By using the Services, you expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, feature or application. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit. Your correspondence and dealings with third parties in connection with the Services are solely between you and such third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>E.</strong> We reserve the right to remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to bar users from our Website and/or the Services if we believe them to be in violation of this Terms of Service. If you feel that any Content currently Posted on our Website or the Services is in violation of this Terms of Service, please click on the "Report this Entry" link next to the non-compliant Content and follow the instructions provided.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="V">V. CONTENT OWNERSHIP AND GRANT OF RIGHTS</h2>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> We Heart It and/or its third-party licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in this Website, the Services and any software, mobile applications, web browser extensions and/or bookmarklets made available to you in connection with the Services. However, we do not claim any ownership in the Content you or our other users Post.</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> So that We Heart It can operate, maintain, market and improve our Website, our mobile applications and our Services and our users can use and enjoy the same, when you Post Content through our Services (including any Content you have Hearted), you give We Heart It, its affiliates and its third-party providers and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), copy and create derivative works of such Content (either alone or as part of a collective work). As part of the foregoing license grant (the "User Content License"), and without limiting the User Content License, you agree that (i) the other users of our Services shall have the right to comment on your Content and/or to <u>use, publish, display, modify or include</u> a copy of your Content as part of their own user profile and Hearted Content ("ReHearting") and (ii) we have the right to make any of your publicly-Posted Content available to third parties, so that those third parties can distribute, make derivative works of, comment on and/or analyze your Content on other media and services (either alone or as part of a collective work). For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that our third-party content providers, partners and advertisers may display or feature any Content that you Post through our Services in their own Content and promotional material on our Website, including in their profiles on our Website.</p>
    <p><strong>C.</strong> Because of the social nature of Content shared through our Services, when you Post something publicly on our Website or through our Services, others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content, making your Content part of a social conversation that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others and/or removing Content from another user’s profile. You may adjust your privacy settings to make certain portions of your profile private, but the content that you post will still be available through our Services, and others may choose to add descriptive commentary and tags to your Content and/or to ReHeart your Content. As such, and in order to maintain the integrity of the Services, you agree that the rights that you have granted under the User Content License will continue to survive in perpetuity even if you stop using the Services or your account is otherwise terminated.</p>
    <p><strong>D.</strong> Upon termination of your Account or upon your deletion of any Content from the Services, We Heart It shall make reasonable efforts to disassociate such Content from your User Account; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to such Content may not be immediately removed; (b) such removed Content may persist in backups for a reasonable period of time; and (c) such removed Content may continue to be publicly available (and stored on our or third party servers) through the accounts of other users, if the same has been ReHearted.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="VI">VI. Prohibited Actions</h2>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> You agree that you will not:

    <br><br>
    <h2 class="h2" id="XII">XII. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and We Heart It agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to this Terms of Service (referred to as a "Claim") will be resolved as set forth in this Section XII.</p>
    <p><strong>A.</strong> Informal Resolution. You and We Heart It agree that we will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding for at least thirty (30) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. We Heart It will send its notice to your email address. You will send your notice to hello@weheartit.com.</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. We Heart It and you (such references include our respective predecessors in interest, successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service between We Heart It and you. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Terms of Service, and shall be administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by this Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein, We Heart It will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse We Heart It for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, We Heart It shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and We Heart It are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and We Heart It agree that YOU AND We Heart It MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void. </p>
    <p><strong>C.</strong> Formal Resolution. If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, you and We Heart It each agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the Southern District of the State of New York, provided that neither you nor We Heart It shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court, regardless of whether such small claims court is located in New York, for disputes within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.</p>
    <p><strong>D.</strong> Governing Law and Jurisdictional Issues. This Terms of Service is governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed.
