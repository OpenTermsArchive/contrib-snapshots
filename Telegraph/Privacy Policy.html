<strong>Third party advertising cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>
6.1 Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties.
</p>
<p>
Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once.
These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual.
they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.
Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes.
The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies.
other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website).
</p>
<p>
6.2 If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine.
Here are links to the two main third party advertising platforms we use, each of which haveinstructions on how to do this: </p>
