<p>B.
Emails.  </p>
<p>We also may use your email address to send you informational emails, such as news, information about contests or promotions, notifications about tee times discounts or other deals, or changes or enhancements to the Sites.  Certain of these emails may contain tracking capabilities that inform us when emails are opened.  Upon registration for the Sites, you will have the opportunity to choose the email lists to which you would like to subscribe.  If you subsequently don’t want to receive these informational email communications, please refer to the Opt-Out section below, or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the end of every email.  You may subscribe to certain email lists without subscribing to all of them, but you will be required to submit your email address in order to conduct an online tee time transaction.   <b>

Specifically, we may share your PII as follows:  </p>

<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include email promotions, data entry, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  They have access to PII needed to perform their functions.
We use operational service providers to perform certain services on our behalf, such as maintaining the Sites and our mailing lists, storing, processing and transmitting data, creating and executing email campaigns, and providing marketing assistance, web analytics and data analysis.  We may provide your PII to these operational service providers when the information is necessary for them to perform their duties.  We require that our operational service providers protect your privacy and not use your PII in any way that is inconsistent with this Policy including not disclosing ti  to third party marketers that are not associated with Golf Channel.  Additionally, we request such providers not to use your PII for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   Rewards Program</p>
<p>As part of the GolfNow Frequent Golfer program we may release information to rewards partners for the purpose of fulfilling an earned reward.  We may also track the number of rounds and golf courses you have played as part of this program, some of which information will be used to reward our most frequent golfers in a variety of ways.  The information that may be released includes your name and mailing address only and it will be subject to the terms and conditions of the reward partner’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>D.
Fulfillment Partners</p>
<p>In the event that you utilize the Sites to process a transaction (e.g., booking a tee time), we must share certain of your PII with the partner that will fulfill that transaction.  In particular, we will share PII with the golf courses (and other fulfillment partners) in order to confirm your reservation.  You will be able to tell when a third party fulfillment partner is involved in your transactions.  We transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company doing the processing of an order following industry standards governing information protection.  Additionally, we may provide a golf course or other fulfillment partner your entire credit card number in order to allow such partner to enforce its cancellation or “no-show” policy.  We encourage you to review the information privacy practices any fulfillment partners (e.g., golf courses), you may conduct transactions with through the Sites.  You may also receive communications directly from these fulfillment partners.  Additionally, in the event you purchase a tee time through the GolfNow technology residing on an affiliate website, GolfNow may be contractually obligated to provide the affiliate with certain of your PII (e.g., email address).     </p>

Cookies and IP Address Information <blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Golf Channel uses a feature of your browser called a “cookie.”  Cookies are small text files sent to and accessed from your computer.  Your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit the Sites and allows us to correlate your computer with certain usage patterns which are stored in our log files.  We use cookies to gather general, aggregate statistics about the overall usage of the Sites in our continual attempt to improve our products and services.  Golf Channel also uses temporary cookies, often referred to as session cookies, to keep a user logged into the system and aid in the exchange of information between pages without loss of data.  Such a cookie, however, is only stored for the current browsing session and is deleted once the browser is closed.  Golf Channel can only read cookies from the Sites.  Search for <em>Cookies</em> under your web browser’s <em>Help</em> menu for more information on cookie management features available to you.  If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the Sites may not function properly.  For example, if we are able to identify your computer through use of cookies, we will be able to automatically display tee times from your local market.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we may use IP address information to count and track aggregate visits to the Sites, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Sites.  It is not our policy to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
while a particular user’s session can be tracked, the user remains completely anonymous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No PII is gathered or stored in the cookies used by the Sites and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third-party vendors, including Google, show ads for our Sites on search engine results pages and other websites across the Internet.  These third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visit to our Sites.  Our sites use analytics data to also inform and optimize such ad campaigns based on a user’s prior visits to our Sites.  Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
 In addition, users may also opt out of a third party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.  Users may opt out of our use of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics Opt-out page.  We may report users’ aggregate interactions with our ads across the Google Display Network in conjunction with activity on the sites.</p>

Children’s Privacy.
<p>Simply stated, Golf Channel does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13<b>.</b>  Golf Channel encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children and suggests the following to help make a child’s online experience safer: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Know the websites your children are visiting and which websites are appropriate.
and </li>
<li>Look for websites privacy policies.
Know how your child’s information is treated.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We are committed to protecting children’s privacy.  For more information, please visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website regarding protecting children’s privacy online: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm .</p>

Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, alter, or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy not just the first time you visit the Sites, but periodically afterwards as well.
 The date of the last update of the Privacy Policy will always be posted below:</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we make material revisions to the way we collect or use your PII such that we are using it for purposes or sharing such data with third parties that you have not consented to, we will provide you with notice of those changes and may do so by either:  (1) announcing the change on the home page of this site, or (2) taking such other action as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, posting the revised draft of this privacy policy on the Sites.  Any changes to this privacy policy will become effective upon posting of the revised privacy policy on the internet, accessible through this site.  By continuing to use the Sites following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.  If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or in part, please do not continue using the Sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D.
Asset Transfers</p>
<p>We continue to develop our business and in doing so we might choose to buy other businesses or assets, in which case user information associated with such assets shall be governed by this Privacy Policy after completion of the transaction.  User information that another company has collected from you may be included in the transferred assets that we acquire in such a purchase.  Also, if some or all of our assets are acquired by a third party through a sale or other transaction, user information, including the information collected from you through this Site, may be included in the transferred assets.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we make any substantive changes to our Privacy Policy in the future with regard to how we use your PII, we will incorporate those changes here.  Your continued use of the Sites after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes.  If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue use of the Sites.  Lastly, if Golf Channel is sold or merged with another company, your PII will be included as part of the sale but unless you’re notified that the Privacy Policy is changed, your PII will be maintained in the same manner.</p>

</p>
<p>Though we will make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose PII when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief the action is necessary to comply with a pending judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Golf Channel or to protect our rights or the rights of others, to fight fraud, identity theft, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Golf Channel, its employees, members or others.</p>
