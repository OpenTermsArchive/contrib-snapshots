</ul> Wed, Nov 16, 2016 From Sign-up to Opt-out: Results &amp.
Best Practices from Email Audit <p>With Yes Lifecycle Marketing’s patronage, The Online Trust Alliance (OTA) conducted a comprehensive, independent audit of the top 200 online retailers to examine the entire email engagement process, from signing up for a brand’s emails to opting out of its email program. Register to learn best practices for every step of the email mailing process – from effective signup pages, through email validation, and efficient opt-out tactics.</p> Wed, Nov 30, 2016 2016 Breaches: Lessons Learned <p>It seems that every week we hear that another company has just made the news and joined the club known as BREACHED! In this webcast we will discuss the most notable security incidences that happened in 2016.
Our presenters will share real world examples of current breaches that show how vulnerable networks can be without the correct user and data security controls.
In this webcast moderated by Craig Spiezle, Executive Director of OTA you’ll learn:</p> Tue, Dec 6, 2016 IoT Security Foundation Conference 2016 - London <p>Building an Internet of Trust.
The conference will look at what it takes to build an Internet of Trusted Things, what is currently underway, what we can learn from the past to predict the future and the necessary duties of care providers and adopters need to ensure.</p> Wed, Dec 7, 2016 Fall Technology Series: Smart TV <p>Consumers enjoy recommendations based on their television viewing habits (“viewers who watched Mr.
Robot… may enjoy Fight Club”), but who else knows what you’re watching? The golden age of television has arrived with the golden age of television tracking.

<strong>Guest Blog from Pascal Millaire, Symantec</strong>

Ethical Vulnerability Disclosures <p>As a participant of NTIA’s multi-stakeholder vulnerability working group and an attendee to this week’s meeting in DC, I was impressed by the level of collaboration and sharing of best practices.  Progress is encouraging.</p> Mon, Nov 7, 2016 Don’t Be a Tool – Verifying Subscriptions and Honoring Unsubscribes <p>This summer the email marketing industry suffered a setback due to “list bomb” attacks in which thousands of targeted users were unknowingly subscribed to tens of thousands of mailings.
