</ul> Fri, Nov 21, 2014 The Promise of Ad Supply Chain Accountability <p>A few weeks ago, I attended the IAB Ad Operations Summit.
The Summit focused on cleaning up the advertising supply chain, combating fraud, and identifying more streamlined ways to accurately measure ad performance.
The underlying message of the Summit was the need for collaboration and industry buy-in.
Just as standardization is impossible unless everyone is committed to following the same standards, cleaning up the supply chain is impossible unless everyone agrees to identify and shut out disreputable players.</p> Tue, Nov 18, 2014 Big Data Are You Prepared to Seize Opportunities &amp.

<strong>Cybersecurity, The Blind Side, The Insider Threat</strong>
</p>
<p>Perhaps you remember the football movie, The Blind Side, with Sandra Bullock about an impoverished young boy who was adopted and eventually became a NFL football player.
The blind side is also a football term which loosely means “something that approaches from the side you cannot see.” Usually the side of the quarterback away from where he is looking.
Do we have a “blind side” in cybersecurity too? Perhaps.</p> Resources <ul>
