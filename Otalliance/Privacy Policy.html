<br>Federal Trade Commissioners to keynote with participation from the FBI, Secret Service and thought leaders in consumer protection, privacy and cybersecurity</p> Thu, Dec 18, 2014 Sony - It is not about the movie! <p>
<em>
<strong>Sony - It is not about a movie.
It is an attack on our sovereign nation</strong>. </em>
</p>
<p>It is no longer the threat from ballistic missiles, our physical borders or hijacked airplanes.  It is the Internet, the fabric of our lives and economy.</p> Tue, Dec 9, 2014 OTA Supports American Bankers Assoication Petition to the FCC <p>OTA supports the petition for exemption of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) as requested by the ABA, limited to security and fraud prevention notification purposes and respectfully urges the Commission to grant the requested exemption.
Doing so will facilitate prompt and efficient communication of time-sensitive information that can both limit the occurrence and impact of online crime and identity theft.</p> Fri, Nov 21, 2014 The Promise of Ad Supply Chain Accountability <p>A few weeks ago, I attended the IAB Ad Operations Summit.
The Summit focused on cleaning up the advertising supply chain, combating fraud, and identifying more streamlined ways to accurately measure ad performance.
The underlying message of the Summit was the need for collaboration and industry buy-in.
Just as standardization is impossible unless everyone is committed to following the same standards, cleaning up the supply chain is impossible unless everyone agrees to identify and shut out disreputable players.</p> Resources <ul>
