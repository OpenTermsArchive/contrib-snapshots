Information Gathered and Tracked by TheStreet We gather two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information.
Personal Information Personal information is provided by users when registering as a member of TheStreet, our free flagship site, when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and voluntarily at certain other points, such as entering contests or completing surveys.
We will always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information by email at members@TheStreet.
com, or by telephone at (866) 321-TSCM [8726], between the hours of 8:00 a.

Registering for Membership on TheStreet Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on TheStreet.
com.
However, if you would like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, comment on articles, access our free portfolio tool or use certain other parts of our websites, we require you to register here to become a member.
In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password.
You will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registration form.
Subscribing to Premium Services If you would like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you first must register as a member of TheStreet as described above.
Then, on the subscription registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you will need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription.
This may include credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.
Other Personal Information Collection: Â· Portfolio Tool - We provide a free portfolio tool which registered members of TheStreet can use to stay current on stocks in their portfolio.
Participantâs portfolio information is kept confidential.
Â· Blogs - We offer blogs featuring running commentary throughout the trading day by some of our most popular contributors.
These blogs allow subscribers to respond to a bloggerâs commentary or to another subscriberâs post.
Access to some blogs requires a paid subscription to one of our premium services.
We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any positions held in securities they discuss in any comment.
Please note that information submitted to the blogs will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private.
Â· Surveys/Polls - At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reaction to a particular article.
Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally or by third-party partners to better market our services, participation is voluntary.
In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers.
Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.
Â· Contests and Sweepstakes - We may offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrantsâ identities and notifying the winners.
If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered or sponsored by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party.
However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.
