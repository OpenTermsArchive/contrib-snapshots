 Information We Observe or Collect through Technology <ol>

For more details, please see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.</p>
</li>
<li> b.
 Navigational Information <p>When you access our Services, we may collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, <abbr>IP</abbr> address, the site or online service from which you came, and the site or online service to which you navigate.</p>
</li>
<li> c.
 Device Information <p>We collect information about the computer or mobile device used to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website or app usage behavior.</p>
</li>
<li> d.
 Cookies, Clear Gifs and Similar Technologies <p>To better understand how you interact with our Services, we may collect information using cookies, clear-gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs) and similar technologies.
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that's stored by your browser on your device.
It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Services, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return.
This helps us improve our Services, provide better customer service, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.</p>
<p>A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or e-mail message.
It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time the site, document or email in question is viewed.
Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.
and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.
</p>
<p>In addition to cookies and clear gifs, we may also use device identifiers, web storage and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and Services.</p>
<p> The above technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites.
and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services.
Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address).
We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you.
to improve our business.
to transact business.
and to market our products and services on this and other online services and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail.
As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart.
We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences.
The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</p>
<p>For information about your options with respect to cookies, see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.</p>

And we don't control and aren't responsible for their practices.
It is possible that the third party providing content through our Services may collect or observe information through its use of technology.
