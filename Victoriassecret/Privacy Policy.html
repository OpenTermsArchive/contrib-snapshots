Examples of the personal information we collect include name, address, phone number, email address, personal preferences, payment card number, purchase and ordering information, demographic information, responses to survey questions, sizing information and any other information you choose to provide.
Our Services may also give you the option to upload or share pictures or videos of yourself and others.

For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders.
We may also collect contact information about your friends and family members when you participate in one of our refer-a-friend programs.
In these instances, we may send a message to your friend or family member on your behalf.
Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message from you.</p>
</li>
<li> 2. Information Your Devices Provide Automatically <ol>
<li> a. Location Information <p>You may provide information about your location when you access or use our Services.
For more details, please see What choices do you have over how your information is used? below.</p>
</li>
<li> b. Navigational Information <p>When you access our Services, your computer, phone, or other device provides navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, <abbr>IP</abbr> address, the site or online service from which you came, and the site or online service to which you navigate.</p>
</li>
<li> c. Device Information <p>You also provide information about the computer or mobile device used to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (<abbr>IDFA</abbr>) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website or app usage behavior.</p>
</li>
<li> d. Cookies, Clear Gifs and Similar Technologies <p>To better understand how you interact with our Services, we may collect information using cookies, clear-gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs) and similar technologies.
We deliver a customized experience and do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals of web browsers.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that's stored by your browser on your device.
It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Services, what you click on, remember you and your online purchases when you return, and recognize you and honor a special deal for you, when you redeem one of our offers from a third party's site.
This helps us improve and deliver our Services, provide better customer service, tailor and improve your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.</p>
<p>A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or email message.
It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time the site, document or email in question is viewed.
and recognize you and honor a special deal for you, when you navigate from a third party's site to redeem one of our offers that may have appeared there.
Clear gifs in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.
and they help deliver a more personalized or better online experience.
</p>
<p>In addition to cookies and clear gifs, we may also use device identifiers, web storage, and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and Services.</p>
<p>The above technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most: for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites.
and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services.
Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address).
We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you.
to improve our business.
to transact business.
and to market our products and services on this and other online services, and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail.
As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart.
We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences.
The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</p>
