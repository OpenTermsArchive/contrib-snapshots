Your use of the Services constitutes your binding acceptance of these terms and conditions, including any changes or modifications made by Ziff Davis as permitted above. Please be sure to review the Agreement periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version.

You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Services outside of the European Union and European Economic Area, and 16 years of age or older in the European Union and European Economic Area. Ziff Davis complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13.

Creating a Member account if you are under the age of 13 outside of the European Union and European Economic Area or 16 in the European Union and European Economic Area, under automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses constitutes unauthorized use of the Services, and such accounts will be deleted by Ziff Davis.</strong></p>
<p>As part of the registration process, you may be asked to select a username and password and you will be responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure. We may refuse to grant you a username that impersonates someone else, violates or infringes on the trademark or proprietary rights of a third party, or is vulgar, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that your username and password is personal to you and should not be used to provide access to the Services to any other person or entity.</p>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to: (a) provide accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form for a Service (<strong>“Registration Data”</strong>), (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete, and (c) maintain the security of your password.  In the event you compose a profile upon registering for the Services (a <strong>“Member Profile”</strong>), such profile must describe you, an individual person. Examples of inappropriate profiles include, but are not limited to, profiles that purport to represent an animal, place, inanimate object, fictional character, or real individual who is not you. If you wish to view or change your profile, you can do by clicking on the appropriate link listed in the <a href="https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy#control">Updating Your Registration Information</a> section of the <a href="https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy">Ziff Davis Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px">(a) Ziff Davis hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use IGN-created and owned content solely in connection with Loops, which enables you to select a custom “loop” of video footage on IGN videos and to share such “loops” with others via a URL provided by us.

Any text or other content posted by you in connection with Loops must not: (a) be libelous, defamatory, threatening, harassing, hateful, or offensive; (b) may not violate or infringe any third party right, including, but not limited to, any copyright, trademark, right of privacy or publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights; or (c) violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">(b) Except as expressly permitted by Ziff Davis or by the owner of the copyright or other such proprietary right, the license granted herein to IGN-created content does not include content or trademarks owned by third parties (including third party content or trademarks incorporated into IGN-created content).  By using Loops, you are solely responsible for determining whether your use of Loops complies with applicable laws, including copyright laws, and you accept all risk of liability associated with your use of Loops and any third party claims that may result from your use.

<p>Any use of Loops in violation of the limitations described above is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate termination or revocation of your access to Loops and/or other portions of the Service, and may subject you to legal liability.</p>

Please note that the PC Mag Premium Service, including all billing, invoices and renewals, is managed by Ziff Davis’ third party vendor, Palm Coast Data.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">(a) <span class="letter-list">Customer Service</span>.

<p style="margin-left: 20px">(b) <span class="letter-list">Payment Obligation and Credit Card Authorization.</span> You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis’ third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">For the IGN Premium Service, payment must be made by Visa, MasterCard or American Express or PayPal.

If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand.

YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.</p>

<h4 class="red-h4">13. Binding Arbitration</h4>
<p><b>ARBITRATION NOTICE:</b>  Unless you opt out in accordance with this Section, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in New York, New York before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered JAMS, pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. If the specific provision of this paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section entitled “Binding Arbitration” shall be null and void.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.</p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out in accordance with this Section, neither you nor Ziff Davis can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Ziff Davis in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:</p>
<address style="padding-left: 25px;">Ziff Davis, LLC<br />
ATTN: LEGAL: Arbitration Opt Out<br />
114 5th Avenue 15th Floor<br />
New York, New York 10011</address>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address, if any, you use for your respective Ziff Davis account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<h4 class="red-h4">14. Limitation Period for Claims.</h4>
<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<h4 class="red-h4">15. Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the “Courts”) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts.</p>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.
</p>
<h4 class="red-h4" id="section-16">16. New Jersey Residents.</h4>
<p>If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney’s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law.  Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13.</p>
<h4 class="red-h4">17. Australia Residents.</h4>
<p>Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 14) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the “ACL”) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law).</p>
