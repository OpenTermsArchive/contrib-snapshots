      <p>The following Service Terms apply to Customer to the extent the specific Service is included in the applicable ordering document. LinkedIn may update these Service Terms from time to time. LinkedIn reserves the right to upgrade, update or discontinue any aspect or feature of a Service in whole or in part; provided, however, that if LinkedIn discontinues a Service in whole during the term of an ordering document, then LinkedIn will provide Customer with an alternative or replacement service.</p> <h3><strong>1. TALENT SERVICES</strong></h3> <h4><strong>1.1. Recruiter Corporate</strong></h4> <p>Customer will use the Recruiter Corporate Service (and related services) and information about Members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of Customer or its Affiliates, or, if Customer is acting as a Staffing Agency or BPO, only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients. "Staffing Agency" means a Customer that uses the Services to recruit on behalf of a third-party client using Customer's own name and/or logo, including without limitation, staffing agencies, executive search firms, and direct hire firms. "BPO" means a business process outsourcer Customer that recruits on behalf of a client using the client's name and/or logo, including without limitation, recruitment process outsources, managed service providers, and clinical research outsourcers. Customer will inform LinkedIn of its Staffing Agency or BPO classification with a client before purchasing the Recruiter Corporate Service, and Agency will promptly inform LinkedIn of any change in classification. Staffing Agency purchases of Recruiter Corporate seats are governed by the master subscription agreement between LinkedIn and Staffing Agency. BPO purchases of Recruiter Corporate seats are governed by the master subscription agreement between LinkedIn and the BPO's client. Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.</p> <h4><strong>&nbsp;1.2. Recruiter Professional</strong></h4> <p>Customer will use the Recruiter Professional Service and related services ("RPS") and information about Members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients. Only Staffing Agencies may use RPS. Customer is prohibited from using RPS to recruit on behalf of a client using the client's name and/or logo. Customer will inform LinkedIn of its Staffing Agency classification with a client before purchasing RPS, and Staffing Agency will promptly inform LinkedIn of any change in classification. Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.</p> <h4><strong>1.3. Recruiter Lite</strong></h4> <p>Customer will use the Recruiter Lite Service (and related services) and information about Members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of Customer or its Affiliates, or, if Customer is a Staffing Agency, only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients.

Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.</p> <h4><strong>1.4. Additional Terms for Recruiter</strong></h4> <p>Recruiter seats may be reassigned in accordance with the terms set forth on the&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/1870?lang=en" target="_self">Recruiter Help Portal</a>. Customer will not share any information regarding a LinkedIn Member’s Open to Opportunities status with that Member’s current employer. Customer will ensure that its Customer Users use the Recruiter InMail feature in accordance with LinkedIn’s&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/50181/recruiter-inmail-policy?lang=en" target="_self">Recruiter InMail Policy</a>.&nbsp;Customer’s breach of this Section will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.</p> <h4><strong>1.5. Job Postings &amp; Job Slots</strong></h4> <p>The Job Postings and Job Slots Services (collectively, the “Jobs Services”) are designed to help Customer reach quality candidates for job opportunities. Job Postings posted under available Job Slots will expire upon the expiration/termination of the ordering document. The&nbsp;Jobs Services allow Customer's postings to be served on properties (e.g., websites&nbsp;and&nbsp;mobile applications) of LinkedIn&nbsp;and&nbsp;enabled&nbsp;third&nbsp;parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer is responsible for (i) all postings and content through the Jobs Services or otherwise to LinkedIn, including but not limited to the job descriptions, creatives, trademarks, images, URLs and pixels that comprise the postings or content therefor (collectively, the “Postings”); and (ii) all content and property to which Postings may direct viewers, as well as redirects (“Destinations”). Customer may not resell or transfer access to the Jobs Services to any other party. Each Posting must be for 1 job opportunity; it is not permitted for a Posting to solicit applications for more than one position. Customer will not copy, duplicate, replicate, scrape or otherwise reproduce jobs from a hiring company’s website and upload them to LinkedIn as Postings without the hiring company’s prior knowledge and authorization. Where a hiring company informs LinkedIn that Customer has done so without its prior knowledge and authorization, LinkedIn reserves the right to remove such Postings immediately and without prior notice to Customer. In order to post a job for a position at a third-party entity, Customer must have an active contract in place with the third-party entity providing active recruiting services beyond job posting for the applicable position. Customer agrees that it will not, and will not enable or authorize any third party, by virtue of the Postings, Destinations, or use of the Jobs Services, to:</p> <ul> <li>Create Postings without a reasonable and legitimate intent to hire for a bona fide job opportunity or the specific position listed;</li> <li>Create Postings that intentionally misrepresent the job, hiring company, or poster;</li> <li>Fail to clearly disclose in any Posting that a position is for an independent contractor or is part-time, piecework, commission-based, or has otherwise nontraditional working conditions or compensation may constitute intentional misrepresentation;</li> <li>Create Postings for “business opportunities” that require payments or recruitment of others or that resemble franchises, multi-level marketing, club memberships, distributorships, or are entirely or almost entirely commission-based;</li> <li>Provide identifiable candidate resume or application data to any other parties;</li> <li>“Spam” or otherwise contact applicants for purposes other than related to the specific employment opportunity described in the posting;</li> <li>Harass, stalk, or contact any applicant after they have asked not to be contacted;</li> <li>Create Postings in the United States without possessing valid Federal or State Employer Identification Numbers, if applicable, or create Postings in any other location in a manner that would not allow compliance with applicable tax and employment laws;</li> <li>Create Postings for jobs that require applicants to pay for employment or otherwise bear costs related to employment in violation of applicable law;</li> <li>Soliciting employees by intentional misrepresentation;</li> <li>Create Postings, advertise employment positions, or otherwise engage in recruitment or hiring practices that would be a violation of the law in Customer’s state or country, the state or country where the job is to be performed, or the applicable laws of the jurisdiction that governs the LSA between the parties;</li> <li>Engage in solicitations, communications or transactions that violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the prohibition of employment discrimination, or that violate applicable laws governing legal eligibility to work;</li> <li>Engage in illegal or fraudulent conduct;</li> <li>Except as expressly authorized by LinkedIn in writing, use any automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access, modify, download, query or otherwise collect information from LinkedIn’s websites;</li> <li>Except as expressly authorized by LinkedIn in writing, copy, modify or create derivative works of the Jobs Services or any related technology; or</li> <li>Create Postings that contain malware, spyware or any other malicious code or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Jobs Services or any device or system or breach or circumvent any security measure of LinkedIn or a third party.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>1.6. Career Pages</strong></h4> <p>All Career page "traffic driver" ad impressions will launch within 90 days from the Start Date in the ordering document, using social ad units and targeting generated by LinkedIn.</p> <h4><strong>1.7. Talent Hub</strong></h4> <p>Talent Hub is a hiring platform that enables customers to source, manage, and hire candidates in one place. Talent Hub is a system of record that is an applicant management system designed to host all candidate data, including first name and last name, email address, telephone number, professional history, interview and hiring team feedback and evaluations, salary information, final disposition, and other candidate data received from Customer’s third-party talent acquisition extensions (“Talent Hub Data”). Talent Hub will be used to manage candidates through the recruiting workflow ultimately helping companies collaborate on jobs and candidates and hire in the same platform they use to source candidates. LinkedIn will use Talent Hub Data to provide, support, and improve LinkedIn’s Services, including to provide Talent Hub Data in the aggregate to surface insights and benchmarking to help companies have better insight into their process relative to their peers. Customer is solely responsible for the implementation of Talent Hub, including (i) migrating any candidate data from Customer’s third-party applicant tracking system to Talent Hub; (ii) providing the candidate data in a format that is acceptable to LinkedIn and compatible with Talent Hub; and (iii) ensuring it has all necessary consents to provide the candidate data to LinkedIn (collectively, the “Implementation”). LinkedIn disclaims any and all liability in connection with the Implementation.</p> <h3><strong>2. SALES SERVICES</strong></h3> <h4><strong>2.1. Sales Navigator</strong></h4> <p>Customer may use the Sales Navigator Service only to generate sales leads.&nbsp;Customer may not use the Sales Navigator Service for recruiting purposes. Customer will have access to Sales Navigator&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="http://lnkd.in/sales-solutions-services" target="_self">value-add services</a>&nbsp;for the Term of the ordering document. No refund or credit will be provided if the value-add services are not used during the Term of the ordering document.</p> <h3><strong>3. LEARNING SERVICES</strong></h3> <h4><strong>3.1. lynda.com for Library (LyndaLibrary)</strong></h4> <p>Customer will have access to the content on the&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="http://lynda.com/" target="_self">lynda.com</a>&nbsp;platform only.&nbsp;A Customer User must be a library patron. For lynda.com Customers only, the User Agreement does not apply. Customer will designate a single administrator and that administrator will have access to the reporting and management tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Users of the content on the lynda.com platform are subject to the&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.lynda.com/aboutus/otl-privacy.aspx" target="_self">Lynda.com Privacy Policy</a>. For each LyndaLibrary seat purchased by Customer, any Customer User who has a valid Customer’s library card, pin/password may access the learning content via lynda.com for Library during the term of the order. A Customer User is an individual designated by Customer that has (1) registered, received and maintains an active Customer library card/Customer Account and (2) who resides (maintains a valid address) in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer must verify that the individual resides in the Customer’s geographical service location. A Customer User may be a staff member even if the staff member does not reside in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer may only market the LyndaLibrary service to individual patrons of the Library. Customer or any government entity related to or associated with Customer will not market to any other groups, including but not limited to, any business, corporation, school district, school (including higher education such as universities or colleges), non-profits, and government agencies.&nbsp;Customer’s breach of the foregoing sentence will be considered a material breach of the Agreement. If LinkedIn determines that Customer or any other entity is marketing the LyndaLibrary without permission, LinkedIn will terminate Customer’s order. Customer will not be able to establish sub administrators, upload content, reassign seats, or display or perform the content in a public setting, including a conference room or classroom. The concurrent number of Customer Users who can access the Lynda content at any one time is limited to the number of seats purchased by Customer.</p> <h4><strong>3.2. LinkedIn Learning&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p>Customer will have access to the content on the LinkedIn.com platform only. Customer Users may only view the content online via the LinkedIn.com platform or by downloading the content for offline viewing via the LinkedIn Learning mobile app.&nbsp;Customer may not violate the intellectual property or other rights of LinkedIn, including, without limitation, (i) copying or distributing our learning videos or other materials or (ii) using the word “LinkedIn” or our logos in any business name, email, or URL except as provided in the <a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://brand.linkedin.com/policies" target="_self">Brand Guidelines</a>. Unless agreed to otherwise by the parties on the applicable ordering document, a Customer User must be a then current&nbsp;employee, contractor, student or library patron depending upon the LinkedIn Learning service purchased by Customer. For the LinkedIn Learning service, the User Agreement will apply&nbsp;if Customer connects its LinkedIn Learning dashboard to its Customer Users' LinkedIn.com profiles.&nbsp;Customer User must be at least 16 years of age.&nbsp;Customer will designate a single master administrator ("Master Admin").&nbsp;The Master Admin will have access to the reporting and management tools and will be able to establish full administrators and sub administrators with limited rights and access.&nbsp;Except as set forth below,&nbsp;Customer may only display or perform the content in a public setting, including a conference room or classroom, if Customer has purchased seats for all Customer Users. Customer retains sole responsibility for all&nbsp;content (including third-party content) uploaded or provided by Customer through our Services and will monitor, review, and remove such content. All content Customer uploads or provides through our Services must be owned or licensed to Customer. Only&nbsp;Customer will have access to such content. One LinkedIn Learning seat = One Customer User, and each seat is deemed used/active when a Customer User registers to access the content service. Each Customer User must have a unique identifier for a login, such as a unique email address or IP address. Aliases are not permitted. During each 12-month term of an ordering document,&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer may reassign&nbsp;10 seats or 25% of the total number of seats purchased, whichever is greater.&nbsp;For LinkedIn Learning Campus, the number of seat reassignments is equal to 10 seats or 35% of the total number of seats purchased, whichever is greater.&nbsp;During the term of a LinkedIn Campus ordering document, should the Campus Customer exceed the total FTE count listed on the ordering document Customer may increase the FTE count with an executed, zero-dollar add-on ordering document. The add-on seats will co-term with the original order form. If the original ordering document is for a Partial Campus (a specific department on Campus) the additional zero-dollar seats requested must be used for said specific department only. LinkedIn Campus FTE quantities listed on the initial invoice represent the starting quantities that will be provisioned by LinkedIn.</p> <h4><strong>3.2.1. LinkedIn Learning for Library</strong></h4> <h4>For each LinkedIn Learning for Library seat purchased by Customer, any Customer User who has a valid Customer’s library card, or pin/password,&nbsp;may access the LinkedIn Learning content via LinkedIn Learning for Library during the term of the order. The LinkedIn User Agreement will not apply to LinkedIn Learning for Library Customer Users.&nbsp;A Customer User is an individual designated by Customer that has (1) registered, received and maintains an active Customer library card/Customer Account and (2) who resides (maintains a valid address) in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer must verify that the individual resides in the Customer’s geographical service location. A Customer User may be a staff member even if the staff member does not reside in Customer’s geographical service location. Customer may only market the LinkedIn Learning for Library service to individual patrons of the Library. Customer or any government entity related to or associated with Customer will not market to any other groups, including but not limited to, any business, corporation, school district, school (including higher education such as universities or colleges), non-profits, and government agencies.&nbsp;Customer’s breach of the foregoing sentence will be considered a material breach of the Agreement. If LinkedIn determines that Customer or any other entity is marketing LinkedIn Learning for Library without permission, LinkedIn will terminate Customer’s order. Customer will not be able to establish sub administrators, upload content, reassign seats, or display or perform the content in a public setting, including a conference room or classroom.</h4> <h3><strong>4. INSIGHTS SERVICES</strong></h3> <h4><strong>4.1. Custom Insights &amp; Analytics Reports&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p>LinkedIn may generate certain insights and analytics reports on Customer's behalf derived from aggregating applicable Member profile data (“Insights Reports”). LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, may adjust or decline to include certain Member profile data in Insights Reports if LinkedIn believes the exposure of the Member profile data may compromise the privacy of Members or other LinkedIn customers. Insights Reports generated by LinkedIn on Customer's behalf are considered delivered on the date the Insights Reports are sent to Customer, even if LinkedIn provides additional analysis of the Insights Reports at a later date (e.g. responses to follow-up questions, modifications, etc.). LinkedIn will not release any underlying LinkedIn data or third-party data used to generate Insights Reports. LinkedIn retains ownership of all right, title, and interest to all content included in the Insights Reports (including any associated intellectual property rights). LinkedIn hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use, distribute, and display the Insights Reports for Customer’s non-commercial activity. Customer will be prohibited from externally publishing Insights Reports or sharing Insights Reports with third parties without LinkedIn prior written approval in each instance. Insights Services will expire upon the expiration of the ordering document, and Insights Reports are deemed delivered the earlier of the: (i) actual delivery or (ii) the expiration of the ordering document.</p> <h4><strong>4.2. LinkedIn Talent Insights&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p>The LinkedIn Talent Insights ("LTI") Service provide customers self-serve on-demand, real-time access to aggregated LinkedIn Member profile data. LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, may adjust or decline to include certain Member profile data in the LTI Service if LinkedIn believes the exposure of the Member profile data may compromise the privacy of Members or other LinkedIn customers.

LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, may adjust or decline to include certain company data in the LSI Service if LinkedIn believes the exposure of the company data may compromise the privacy of Members or other LinkedIn customers. LinkedIn will not release any underlying LinkedIn data or third-party data used in the LSI Service. LinkedIn retains ownership of all right, title, and interest to all content included in the LSI Service (including any associated intellectual property rights). LinkedIn hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use, distribute, and display reports and data generated via the LSI Service (“LSI Data”) for Customer’s&nbsp;<em><u>internal use only</u></em>. Customer&nbsp;<strong>shall not</strong>&nbsp;(i) publish externally or share the LSI Data with third parties without LinkedIn’s prior written approval in each instance; (ii) trade, sell/re-sell or otherwise monetize the LSI Service or LSI Data or access to the same, without LinkedIn’s written consent; (iii) scrape or aggregate the LSI Data for the purposes of creating a competing service;&nbsp;(iv) use the LSI Data for securities investing and/or to inform merger &amp; acquisition-based decisions; or (v) use the LSI Service or LSI Data for talent acquisition. LSI Data is derived from LinkedIn company pages, and<strong>&nbsp;LinkedIn disclaims all liability regarding the quality, accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the LSI Data</strong>. Should Customer’s Agreement or ordering document with LinkedIn specify a limit on the number of times LSI Data may be downloaded by Customer, such downloads must be completed during the contract term and may not be carried into a new contract period.&nbsp;If the term of Customer’s Agreement or ordering document is greater than 12 months, the download limit is fixed annually and any unused downloads may not be carried into the subsequent year of the Agreement or ordering document. <strong>Customer’s breach of this Section 4.3 will be considered a material breach of the Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;The LSI Service is non-cancelable and non-refundable.</p> <h3><strong>5. TALENT MEDIA SERVICES</strong></h3> <h4><strong>5.1. General</strong></h4> <p>Customer authorizes LinkedIn to place advertisements ("Talent Media") containing artwork, copy, active URLs, and other advertising material and technology provided by Customer (“Advertising Materials”) on LinkedIn websites and/or third-party network websites, subject to Customer electing to enable or disable the delivery of Talent Media on third-party network websites&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83628" target="_self">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83628</a>) (collectively, the “Site”). Customer will submit to LinkedIn all Advertising Materials for Talent Media in accordance with LinkedIn’s&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/topics/8154/8155" target="_self">Advertising Specifications and Guidelines</a>&nbsp;(collectively, “Ad Policies”). Customer will obtain all necessary rights, consents, licenses and clearances for LinkedIn to include the Advertising Materials in Talent Media. LinkedIn reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject or remove from the Site any Talent Media for which the Advertising Materials or the website to which the Talent media is linked (i) do not comply with the Ad Policies; (ii) do not comply with any applicable law, regulation, other judicial or administrative order, or industry self-regulatory principles; or (iii) may tend to bring, disparagement, ridicule, or scorn upon LinkedIn or its Affiliates. LinkedIn will use all Talent Media in compliance with this Agreement and any written instructions provided on the ordering document. LinkedIn’s measurements are the definitive measurements for calculating fees. Third party impression tracking is unavailable for Talent Media.&nbsp;LinkedIn and its Affiliates may participate in ad placing auctions to promote its own services or otherwise communicate to its users. LinkedIn makes no guarantees as to (a) the results or distribution of any Talent Media in any manner; or (b) any number of sends, impressions, opens or clicks. No make goods or credit will be provided to Customer. LinkedIn does not screen or attempt to verify the accuracy of any information on the Site or in the Member profiles, and, as such, does not guarantee the identity or Personal Data of the individuals who will view the Talent Media purchased by Customer. Unless agreed to otherwise by the parties on the applicable ordering document: (i) Customer will pre-pay for Talent Media; (ii) Talent Media is non-cancellable and non-refundable; (iii) Talent Media will expire upon the expiration of the ordering document; and (iv) impressions are deemed delivered the earlier of (a) actual delivery or (b) the expiration of the ordering document. As provided in LinkedIn’s&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_self">Privacy Policy</a>, LinkedIn may use device identifiers obtained on and off the LinkedIn website for Talent Media, including to determine which devices Members may use and serve advertisements to them on their different devices. LinkedIn and Customer will each prominently post a complete and accurate privacy policy on their respective websites and mobile applications, including information regarding cross-device tracking and advertising targeting.</p> <h4><strong>5.2. Recruitment Ads, Sponsored Jobs and Sponsored Updates</strong></h4> <p>Recruitment Ads, Sponsored Jobs and Sponsored Updates are Talent Media sold under an&nbsp;auction model. The&nbsp;auction&nbsp;is a generalized second price auction&nbsp;and Customer only has to pay just enough to beat the second highest bidder. For example, if the winning advertiser has a bid of ten ($10) dollars cost-per-click, but the next highest bid is seven ($7) dollars, the winning advertiser only pays $7.01. The second price method allows each advertiser to bid the absolute maximum they are willing to pay for the Talent Media. LinkedIn will charge enough to enable the highest price to be paid to win the&nbsp;auction.&nbsp;</p> <h4><strong>5.3. Work With Us Ads</strong></h4> <p>Work With Us Ads will launch within 3 days from the Start Date in the ordering document using a default ad unit configured by LinkedIn, unless otherwise agreed in writing by LinkedIn. LinkedIn cannot identify all Members at a specific company because of company name inconsistencies. Inconsistencies arise because a Member can fill-out their “Company Name” field by either selecting a company name from a pre-existing list generated by the LinkedIn system or typing in their own custom company name. LinkedIn can only identify Members who have selected a company name from the pre-existing list.</p> <h4><strong>5.4. Pipeline Builder</strong></h4> <p>Customer will use the Pipeline Builder Service and information about Members only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of Customer or its Affiliates, or, if Customer is an approved agency, only to recruit individuals to become employees and consultants of its clients.</p> <h4><strong>5.5. Talent Solutions Content Partner Program</strong></h4> <p>If Customer is participating in the&nbsp;Talent Solutions Content Partner Program as set forth in the ordering document, then Customer will comply with the&nbsp;<a rel="NOOPENER NOFOLLOW" href="https://legal.linkedin.com/LTS-Content-Partner-Program-Terms" target="_self">Talent Solutions Content Partner Program Terms</a>.</p> <h3><strong>6. ELEVATE SERVICE</strong></h3> <p>Customer will maintain a social media policy and ensure that its personnel comply with the policy. Only Customer's designated curator(s) is/are authorized to post content to the Elevate Service. Customer Users, who are not curators, may only read and forward content. Customer will&nbsp;ensure that it owns or has the necessary licenses, rights, and consents to the content it posts to the Elevate Service.</p> <h3><strong>7.
