Use of your information by other companies We share user information with other companies for various reasons.
What information we make available to other companies depends on the nature of our relationships with them.
We generally require these other companies to keep our users' information confidential.
Service Providers: We may share all of the types of information we collect with vendors who provide services (such as email messaging), conduct surveys, and run sweepstakes on our behalf.
Advertisers and behavioral targeting companies: Advertisers, advertising networks and behavioral targeting companies use tracking technologies to collect information about users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users.

We may also transfer your information to another company in connection with a corporate restructuring, such as a sale or merger.
Tracking technologies We, as well as other companies, use tracking technologies to collect and store data about your computer or mobile device and your activities on our sites and apps.
Cookies: When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites.
Our cookies expire after two years, and we reset this timeline after a year.
Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads.
Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative.
NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies.
To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit http://www.
networkadvertising.
org/ and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button.
To learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: deleting cookies and deleting flash cookies.
Pixel tags and other technologies: We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails.
These technologies are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).
For example, we use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services.
Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
Mobile Device IDs: If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps.
Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted.
Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you.
Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.
If you install one of our apps on your mobile device, your use of the app is subject to our app license agreement.
