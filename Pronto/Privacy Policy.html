</p>
<p> Cookies: When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites.
Our cookies expire after two years, and we reset this timeline after a year.
Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads.
Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
</p>
<p> Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative.
NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies.
To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/ and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button.
To learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: deleting cookies and deleting flash cookies.
</p>
<p> Pixel tags and other technologies: We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails.
These technologies are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).
For example, we use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services.
Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
</p>
<p> Mobile Device IDs: If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you.
We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps.

Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you.

If you install one of our apps on your mobile device, your use of the app is subject to our app license agreement.
