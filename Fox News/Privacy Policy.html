<a name="test">&nbsp;</a><h3 id="test">1) Scope and Application</h3>
<p>Fox News Network, LLC ("Fox News," "our" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets that link to or are otherwise subject to this privacy policy (collectively, the "Fox News Services"). California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below. By using Fox News Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies ("Fox News Affiliates") is available at&nbsp;<a href="//www.foxcorporation.com">www.foxcorporation.com</a>.</p>
<p>As set forth in our&nbsp;<a href="//www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, the Fox News Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox News Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Fox News Services and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Fox News Service. This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
<a name="collection">&nbsp;</a><h3>2) Collection of Information</h3>
<p>Fox News and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information</strong>&nbsp;is the information you submit to register for a Fox News Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, user/display name, household income, political views, and birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Public Information and Posts</strong>&nbsp;consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox News Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user/display name, comments, predictions, likes (or "kudos"), status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Social Media.</strong>&nbsp;If you access or log-in to a Fox News Service through a social media service or connect a Fox News Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Fox News Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox News Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox News to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Activity Information.</strong>&nbsp;When you access and interact with the Fox News Services, Fox News and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Our websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox News Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.</p>
<p>Other parties that support the Fox News Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox News Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox News Services or other parties’ services. Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox News does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.</p>
<p>Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox News Services.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong>&nbsp;We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox News Affiliates or business partners.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong>&nbsp;At this time we do not respond to browser ‘Do Not Track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
<a name="use">&nbsp;</a><h3>3) Use and Disclosure</h3>
<p>We may use the information we collect from and about you to provide the Fox News Services and features to you, including: to measure and improve those Fox News Services and features and to develop new products and services; to improve your experience with both online and off-line Fox News Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries. In order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest. When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Fox News Services.</strong>&nbsp;The information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the Fox News Services, and manage and/or provide the Fox News Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>To allow social sharing functionality.</strong>&nbsp;If you log in with or connect a social media service account with Fox News Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Fox News Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your Fox News Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your Fox News Services account and do not participate in social sharing on Fox News Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>To provide co-branded services and features.</strong>&nbsp;We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies ("Co-Branded Services"). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on Fox News Services or on that other party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party. That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To deliver relevant advertisements.</strong>&nbsp;Fox News and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the Fox News Services or another service (on any of your devices). This may include, for example, sharing email address (in hashed form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers. In some instances, these entities may return an online identification code that we may store in a first party cookie, or other similar technology, for our use in online and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please click&nbsp;<a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out">here</a><a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>As noted above, advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests. The information may also be used to deliver more relevant advertising to you across marketing channels, including email. To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see&nbsp;<a href="//www.youradchoices.com">https://youradchoices.com/</a>. If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit&nbsp;<a href="//optout.aboutads.info/">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="//optout.networkadvertising.org/#">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#</a>&nbsp;on each of your devices and browsers. To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s "Limit Ad Tracking" or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at&nbsp;<a href="//www.youradchoices.com/appchoices">https://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a>. To opt out on connected TVs, please use the setting to opt out of ads personalization, ""Interest-based Ads," or equivalent settings on your device. Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.</p>

<strong>To contact you.</strong>&nbsp;Fox News may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to the Fox News Services. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can change your account setting or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.
