Data Protection Policy</b>
</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our website.
The protection and<br>
confidentiality of your personal data is of particular importance for<br>
StepStone.
</p>
<p>In this document we will inform you about the processing<br>
of personal data in connection with the services we offer at www.stepstone.com<br>
and other websites or apps (collectively referred to as<br>
“Platforms”) that incorporate this Data Protection Policy.
Personal<br>
data comprises all information that relates to an identified or identifiable<br>
natural person (Article 4 (1) GDPR).
This includes information such as your<br>
name, e-mail address, postal address, or telephone number.
Information that is<br>
not directly associated with your identity, e.g.
the number of users of an<br>
Internet site, does not fall within this scope.</p>
<p>
<b>1.     <br>
</b>
<b>Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?</b>
</p>
<p>The data controller<br>
(hereinafter referred to as “StepStone” or “we”) in the<br>
sense of the General Data Protection Regulation and other national data<br>
protection laws of the member states as well as other data protection<br>
regulations is:</p>

3.     <br>Purposes<br>
and legal basis of the data processing and period for which data will be stored in the<br>
context of a general use of our Platforms and services
<p>In the following we inform you<br>
about the different purposes for which we process personal data, on which legal<br>
basis such processing takes place, and for how long we store the data.
</p>
<p>Insofar as we obtain the<br>
consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art.
6 (1) (a) EU<br>
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the legal basis for the processing<br>
of personal data.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the<br>
performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art.
6 (1) (b)<br>
GDPR will be the legal basis.
This also applies to processing operations<br>
required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
If processing of personal data<br>
is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to, Art.<br>
6 (1) (c) GDPR is the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard the<br>
legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests,<br>
fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the<br>
first interest, Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.</p>
<p>The personal data of the data<br>
subject will be stored for as long as the purpose continues.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.1  </b>
<b>General access to our<br>
Platforms</b>
</p>
<p>With each access to our Platforms, we<br>
automatically collect data and information from the accessing device and store<br>
this data and information in the log files of the server.
We may collect (1)<br>
the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the<br>
accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our<br>
website (known as referrers), (4) the sub-web pages that are accessed on our<br>
website (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet<br>
protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the<br>
accessing system and (8) other similar data and information used to defend any<br>
attacks <b>against</b> our IT systems.
For security purposes, i.e.
to be able to reconstruct an<br>
eventual attack against our Platforms, we store such data including the IP<br>
address for 14 days and then anonymize or delete such data.
The IP address is<br>
required during the connection to transfer the contents of our Platform to your<br>
device.
The legal basis for the processing and storage of the IP address is a<br>
legitimate interest as per Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legitimate interest for<br>
the transmission of the IP address is that it is required to display the<br>
contents of the website.
without transmission of the IP address it is not<br>
possible to display the content of the Platform.
The legimtiate interest for<br>
the temporary storage are our security interests.</p>
<p>
<b>3.2  </b>
<b>Optimization<br>
of search and recommendation functions</b>
</p>
<p>We may also store information<br>
about your usage patterns on our Platforms in order to create statistical<br>
models to make our Platforms more user-friendly and, in particular, to optimize<br>
the functionalities to search for and recommend suitable job advertisements.
In<br>
this context we also save your IP address in a pseudonymized form (that means<br>
that a natural person can no longer be identified based purely on the<br>
information in the statistical model) to exclude automated accesses (bots) to our<br>
Platforms when creating the statistical models.
Legal basis for this purpose is<br>
Art.
6 (1) GDPR.
Our legitimate interest is to ensure the functionality of the<br>
statistical model to improve our services.
The IP address is deleted after one<br>
year.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.3  </b>
<b>Objections to marketing</b>
<br>
If you raise an objection with us against marketing purposes, we may put your<br>
personal contact information (name, address, telephone number, fax number,<br>
e-mail address) on a blacklist to ensure that we no longer send you any<br>
unwanted marketing material.
The legal basis is a legitimate interest within<br>
the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR, where the legitimate interest is that we<br>
can meet our obligations from your objection against marketing.
The data will<br>
be stored for this purpose until you expressly withdraw the objection to<br>
marketing in writing.</p>
<p>
<b>3.4  </b>
<b>StepStone surveys</b>
</p>
<p>StepStone organizes market surveys from time to<br>
time.
As part of such surveys we will not collect any personal data, but at the<br>
end of the survey we might offer you the opportunity to participate in a<br>
competition.
In order to participate in the competition you will have to<br>
provide us with your e-mail address, which we will only use for the purpose of<br>
the competition to notify you if you have won a prize.
In particular, the<br>
e-mail address will be stored completely separately from your answers to the<br>
survey.
The legal basis for the storage of your email address is your consent<br>
under Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR.
We will store your email address for this purpose<br>
until the end of the respective competition.</p>
<p>In this context we use Easyfeedback GmbH,<br>
Ernst-Abbe-Straße 4, 56070 Koblenz, Germany as data processor.
They provide the<br>
platform on which the surveys take place.
Easyfeedback uses Strato AG,<br>
Pascalstraße 10, 10587 Berlin, Germany as host provider and Zeusware GmbH,<br>
Grünauer Str.
201-209, 12557 Berlin, Germany, for the server management as<br>
additional processors, so that these are recipients of data.
In any case they<br>
only process the data according to our instructions.</p>
<p>
<b>3.5  </b>
<b>Contact<br>
form and e-mail contact</b>
</p>
<p>Our Platforms provide contact<br>
forms that can be used to contact us electronically.
By clicking the<br>
“Send” button, you consent to the transmission to us of the data<br>
entered in the input form.
In addition, we save the date and time of your contact.<br>
Alternatively, contact via the e-mail address provided is possible.
In this<br>
case, the user’s personal data transmitted along with e-mail and our<br>
response will be stored.
The personal data voluntarily transmitted to us in<br>
this context is used to process your inquiry and to contact you as needed.
The<br>
legal basis for the transmission of the data is Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR.
The data<br>
will be used for this purpose until the specific conversation with you has<br>
ended.
The conversation will be deemed ended when it can be inferred from the<br>
circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.6  </b>
<b>Facebook</b>
<strong>
<br>
Connect</strong>
<br>With Facebook Connect, you can use your Facebook<br>
account to open a new MyStepStone account at StepStone or to connect to a<br>
MyStepStone account.
If you create a MyStepStone account via Facebook or log in<br>
to an existing MyStepStone account via Facebook, we will gain access to your<br>
public profile and your e-mail address.
We use this information to pre-populate<br>
or update your MyStepStone account at StepStone and then provide you with the<br>
MyStepStone account.
Since we use your Facebook data to create a MyStepStone<br>
account, the legal basis is the contract for the MyStepStone account pursuant<br>
to Art.
6 (1) (b) GDPR.
We store your personal data for as long as necessary to<br>
provide the contractually agreed service.
The personal data stored by you in<br>
your “MyStepStone” account is available to you for the duration of<br>
the contract and will be stored by us for this period.
The personal data will<br>
be erased if you do so in relation to individual data or ask us to do so or if<br>
the contract ends, that is, if you or we terminate the contract, further<br>
details are available in the terms of use.</p>
<p>
<b>3.7  </b>
<b>Use<br>
of data processors for hosting and securing our platforms, administrative,<br>
troubleshooting, and support services</b>
</p>
<p>We use data processors, which<br>
we list below, to provide our services.
The legal basis for using these data<br>
processors is legitimate interest under Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legitimate<br>
interest lies in the execution of our business activities, particularly to<br>
provide the services described elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy.
No<br>
conflicting interest is apparent because we have entered into a data processing<br>
agreement with the respective processors under Art.
28 GDPR.</p>
<p>
<b>3.7.1       </b>
<b>Hosting</b>
</p>
<p>We use data processors to host<br>
our Platforms and for back-up services, meaning that personal data that is<br>
stored on our platforms is transferred to these data processors.
These data<br>
processors are Amazon Webservices, Inc., 410 Terry Drive Ave North, WA<br>
98109-5210 Seattle, USA (who processes data solely in the EU), StepStone GmbH,<br>
Axel-Springer-Str.
65, 10969 Berlin, Germany, StepStone Continental Europe<br>
GmbH, Völklinger Straße 1, 40219 Düsseldorf, Germany and StepStone N.V.,<br>
Koningsstraat 47 Rue Royale, 1000 Brussels Belgium.
These data processors will<br>
store the data for the same duration as it is stored on our Platforms for the<br>
various purposes defined in this Data Protection Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.7.2       </b>
<b>Administrative,<br>
troubleshooting, and support services</b>
</p>
<p>We use StepStone Services sp.
z<br>
o.o., ul.
Domaniewska 50, 02-672 Warsaw, Poland, for administrative,<br>
troubleshooting, and support services, and which may consequently also have<br>
access to your personal data.
Generally StepStone Services sp.
z o.o should not<br>
store any personal data.
This will only be done in exceptional cases, e.g.
if<br>
needed to rectify technical issues.
In such cases personal data will only be<br>
stored to the extent and for the duration that is necessary.</p>
<p>
<b>3.7.3      <br>
</b>
<b>Sending of e-mails and other messages</b>
</p>
<p>For the sending of e-mails and<br>
messages through other electronic channels we use the services of Selligent<br>
GmbH, Atelierstraße 12, 81671 Munich, Germany, as a data processor, who in turn<br>
uses the following subcontractors</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent Benelux NV, Kempische Steenweg, 305 box<br>
401 Belgium</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent International, Avenue de Finlande 2 box 2, 1420<br>
Braine-L’Alleud, Belgium</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent France SA, 20 Place des Vins de France RCS, 75012 Paris,<br>
France</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent SA, 1420 Braine-l’Alleud, 2 avenue de Finlande, Belgium</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent Iberica S.L.U, Caille Enrique Granados 86-88, Planta 3 °, 0008<br>
Barcelona, ​​Spain</p>
<p>–       <br>Selligent Ltd, Second Floor, 45 Folgate Street, London E1 6GL, United<br>
Kingdom</p>
<p>Accordingly, these parties may<br>
also be provided with your personal data in the course of data processing<br>
commissioned by us.
It will be stored there for a period that is otherwise<br>
lawful for purposes under this Data Protection Policy, i.e.
in particular for<br>
the contractual communications in the course of contracts with you or otherwise<br>
for promotional communications.</p>
<p>The legal basis for our use of<br>
Selligent is a legitimate interest under Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely<br>
the execution of our business purposes in the course of the processes described<br>
elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy.
No conflicting interest is apparent<br>
in this respect, in particular due to the fact that we have entered into a data<br>
processing agreement with Selligent.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.7.4      <br>
</b>
<b>Proxy caching and web application firewall</b>
</p>
<p>We<br>
use Akamai Technologies GmbH, Parkring 20-22, 85748 Garching, Germany and<br>
Akamai Technologies, Inc., 150 Broadway, Cambridge, 02142 MA, USA as data<br>
processors for the purposes of proxy caching and web application firewall<br>
services.
That means that any visit to our websites is routed through the<br>
servers of Akamai, meaning that the user will not be connected directly to our<br>
servers but to those of Akamai and Akamai will then request the content from<br>
our servers and will deliver it to the user.
Proxy caching in this context<br>
means that Akamai will cache selected content (but not personal data) for a<br>
period of 24 hours, so that this can be delivered faster to you.
The web<br>
application firewall means that Akamai will try to identify malicious web<br>
traffic and will prevent it from accessing our websites.
Akamai does not store<br>
any personal data, but any dataflows between our servers and the user will be<br>
routed through Akamai, so that this can also include personal data.
Data<br>
transferred to Akamai Technologies, Inc is transferred outside the EU and the<br>
EEA.
This is permissible under Art.
45 GDPR because Akamai Technologies, Inc is<br>
Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists<br>
according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250<br>
(http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&amp;from=DE).<br>
The certification can be viewed at<br>
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000Gn4RAAS&amp;status=Active.</p>
<p>With respect to Akamai, the<br>
additional legitimate interest in the context of the legal basis is that we<br>
thereby are also implementing technical and organizational measures to protect<br>
our Platforms and the personal data stored on them.</p>
<p>
<b>3.8  </b>
<b>Google<br>
Re-Captcha</b>
</p>
<p>In<br>
specific cases we use the reCAPTCHA service<br>
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/ by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater<br>
Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”) based on a<br>
legitimate interest (i.e.
the interest to ensure the correctness of data,<br>
avoidance of automatic registrations / orders by so-called bots, and economical<br>
operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) f) GDPR).</p>
<p>Google<br>
is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus warrants that it<br>
complies with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).</p>
<p>We use re-Captcha to<br>
distinguish whether an input is made by a human or abusively by automated,<br>
mechanical processing.
The query in this context includes the sending of the IP<br>
address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to<br>
Google.
Your input will be transmitted to Google and analyzed for this purpose.

YouTube is represented by Google Inc.,<br>
located at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.<br>
On some of our websites we use plugins from YouTube.
If you access our websites<br>
with such a plug-in – for example a media library – a connection to<br>
the YouTube servers will be established and the plugin will be displayed.
It<br>
will then be communicated to the YouTube server which of our websites you have<br>
visited.
If you are logged in as a member of YouTube, YouTube can assign this<br>
information to your personal user account.
When using the plugin, e.g.
by<br>
clicking on the start button of a video, Youtube can also assign this<br>
information to your user account.
You can prevent this by logging out of your<br>
YouTube user account and other user accounts of the YouTube LLC and Google Inc.<br>

<p>Firebase Analytics enables<br>
the analysis of the use of our apps.
This completely anonymized information<br>
about the use of our app is collected and transmitted to Google and stored<br>
there.
Google uses the advertising ID of the device.
Google will use this<br>
information to evaluate the use of our app and to provide us with other<br>

In Device Settings, you can restrict the<br>
use of the Advertising ID (iOS: Privacy / Advertising / No Ad Tracking,<br>
Android: Account / Google / View).
Google Analytics for Firebase (Google Inc.).<br>
We also use Firebase Remote Config, which allows us to run A / B tests and<br>

<p>Google is certified under the<br>

<p>The Google Marketing Services<br>
enable us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted<br>
manner to so that users are only shown advertisements that they may be<br>
interested in.
If a user sees e.g.
advertisements for products that he or she<br>
was interested in on other websites, this is referred to as<br>
“remarketing”.
For this purpose, when our websites and other<br>
websites are accessed on which Google Marketing Services are active, Google<br>
directly executes a Google code and what are termed (re)marketing tags<br>
(invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are<br>
integrated into the website.
These are used to store an individual cookie, i.e.<br>
a small file on the user’s device (comparable technologies may also be<br>
used instead of cookies).
The cookies may be set by various domains, including<br>
google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com,<br>
googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com.
This file records which<br>
websites the user searches for, the content he or she is interested in and<br>
which offers he or she has clicked.
It also stores technical information on the<br>
browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit, and other<br>
information on the use of the online offering.
Similarly, the user’s IP<br>
address is recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we state that<br>
the IP address is shortened in within Member States of the European Union or in<br>
other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in<br>
exceptional cases is it transferred in full to a Google server in the USA and<br>
shortened there.
The IP address is not merged with the user’s data within<br>
other Google offerings.
Google may also combine the above information with<br>
information from other sources.
If the user subsequently visits other websites,<br>
tailored advertisements can be displayed depending on his or her interests.</p>
<p>The user’s data is<br>
processed in a pseudonimyzed form as part of the Google Marketing Services.<br>
This means that Google stores and processes e.g.
not the user’s name or<br>
e-mail address, but instead processes the relevant data based on the cookie<br>
within pseudonymized user profiles.
This means that, from Google’s<br>
perspective, the advertisements are not managed and displayed for a<br>
specifically identifiable person, but for the holder of the cookie, irrespective<br>
of who the holder of this cookie is.
This does not apply if a user has<br>
expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.<br>
The information about the user collected by Google Marketing Services is<br>
transferred to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.</p>
<p>The Google Marketing Services<br>
deployed by us include the “Google AdWords” online advertising<br>
program.
Google AdWords supplies every AdWords customer with a different<br>
“conversion cookie”.
This means that cookies cannot be traced via<br>
the websites of AdWords customers.
The information obtained using the cookie<br>
enables conversion statistics for AdWords customers to be produced who have<br>
opted for conversion tracking.
The AdWords customers are notified of the total<br>
number of users who clicked their advertisement and were forwarded to a page<br>
containing a conversion tracking tag.
However, they are not given any<br>
information that could be used to personally identify users.</p>
<p>We may involve third parties<br>
on the basis of the “DoubleClick” Google marketing services.<br>
DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to place<br>
advertisements on the basis of users’ visits to this website and other<br>
websites on the Internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may deploy<br>
the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google<br>
