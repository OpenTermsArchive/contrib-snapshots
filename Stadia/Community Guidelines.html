                        <p>It’s important that you treat other players the way that you’d like to be treated. If you're unsure if your actions might violate our community guidelines, ask yourself if you would act in the same way when interacting with someone standing next to you.</p>

                        <p>Your safety on Stadia is a top priority for us. Our response to violations of our policies varies and may include:</p>
                        <ul class="list-bullets">
                            <li>Assignment of a new Stadia Name, if you create an inappropriate Stadia Name.</li>
                            <li>Temporary bans: If you violate our policies, we may send you a warning. Repeated violations of our policies, including across platforms like YouTube, may result in temporary restrictions of social features on Stadia, including but not limited to chat, live streaming on YouTube, Crowd Play and access to online multiplayer functionality for varying amounts of time.</li>
                            <li>Permanent ban: Access to the platform may be suspended if you commit egregious or repeated violations or try to circumvent suspensions through the use of multiple accounts. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We don’t take these actions lightly. While we understand that people make mistakes, we believe that learning from mistakes is an opportunity to become better players and people.</p>
                        <p>We hope that all of your experiences on Stadia are positive. Thank you for being a vital part of building and supporting this community with us.</p>
