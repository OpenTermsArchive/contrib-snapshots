<p>
<b> </b>

<p>A "customer" (or "you") is anyone ordering, registering for or making use of any product, service or website of any Economist Group business.</p>
<p>
<b> </b>
</p>
<b>Collection and use of customer information</b>
<p>Your personal details are collected and processed when you order, purchase, register, subscribe or make use of any of our products or services.
Information is collected by the companies of The Economist Group.
For our businesses operated in the EU and EEA, the companies listed at the end of this policy statement are each registered with the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office as a data controller in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit any of our websites or use any of our digital applications (such as our iPhone or iPad applications), we also collect website and application usage information (which may include your reading history and any advertisements you may have viewed), and information about your computer or other digital device and your internet connection.
This includes your computer's or digital device’s IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your internet domain and, if you visited via a link from another website, the URL of the linking page.</p>
<p>The information we collect from you is meant to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulfil your order</li>
<li>manage your registration preferences</li>
<li>send you renewal notifications and/or service notifications</li>
<li>personalise web content and advertising based on your personal characteristics or preferences</li>
<li>ensure, as far as is practical, that our websites and applications are compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors</li>
<li>conduct customer satisfaction surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>And, if you allow us to*, we may also:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell you about additional products and services</li>
<li>tell you about other promotional activities across The Economist Group of companies or other companies with whom we have a business relationship</li>
<li>invite you to participate in market research, surveys and polls for ourselves or for our clients</li>
</ul>
<p>*Please indicate your privacy preferences using the order, registration or subscription form when ordering, purchasing, registering or subscribing.</p>
<p>We also use your information for in-house research and analysis.
This helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve our understanding of customer needs</li>
<li>create marketing profiles</li>
<li>support strategic development</li>
<li>To enable us to conduct research we may share your information with third party suppliers employed to help, if compelled to do so by law, or with other third parties if you give your specific consent, such as in the case of a complaint.
All results of any research and analysis will be anonymised or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal details of individual customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as expressly set out in this policy, we do not use any of your personally identifiable information (which is any information that identifies you or can be used to identify you) for advertising, and nor do we track or collect it other than as stated above so that we can provide you with our products or services.
We also do not track or collect any of your sensitive information which includes information such as your race, religion, ethnicity, and political opinion.
Please note however that the collection, use, and disclosure of information by our business partners are described in their own privacy policies, and consequently may differ from The Economist Group’s Privacy Policy.
We are not responsible for those third party privacy policies and you should ensure that you have read and accept all applicable privacy policies before proceeding.</p>
