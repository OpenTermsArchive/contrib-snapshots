<b>Effective date: January 1, 2011</b>
<br>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how <strong>Gander Mountain</strong>, Overton’s, and other members of the <strong>Gander</strong> Mountain family of businesses (collectively, “the Gander Mountain family of businesses,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) protect your privacy when you use the following Web sites (our “Sites”):</p>

<strong>Gander Mountain</strong> Company (“Gander Mountain”) owns the Site located at GanderMountain.com.
Overton’s, Inc.
(“Overton’s”) owns the Sites located at Overtons.com and OvertonsOutdoors.com.
Consumers Marine Electronics, Inc.

When we wish to describe how one particular Site uses or shares information you submit to it, we will do so by describing how the “Owner” of the Site uses or shares your information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Policy covers the “personal information” we collect through our Sites.
“Personal information” is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.
Examples of personal information include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and the information you provide when you request a catalog, subscribe to a newsletter, or make a purchase at one of our online stores.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The terms “you” and “your,” when used in this Policy, mean any user of our Sites.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to This Policy<br>
</strong>
</p>

We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on our Sites.
These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on our Sites.

Your use of one of our Sites following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Policy.
For this reason, it is important to review this Policy regularly.

<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Notices</strong>

Our Privacy Notices are part of this Policy.</p>

<p>
<strong>Country-Specific Notices</strong>
</p>
<p>Privacy requirements vary from country to country.
To meet these requirements we may include certain “country-specific notices” as part of this Policy.
