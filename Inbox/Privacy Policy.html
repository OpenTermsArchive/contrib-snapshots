com Privacy Policy We take your privacy seriously.
Please read our privacy policy carefully to learn more.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided in your program materials or on the program website.
We recognize the importance of privacy and have attempted to conform this Privacy Policy to applicable industry standards and practices existing at the time of its posting.
We welcome your feedback.
This Privacy Policy, which is a part of the Terms of Use and End User License Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy (collectively, the "Agreement"), explains the types of information we collect through our Services and what we do with such information.
"Services" are defined in the Terms of Use.
Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning defined elsewhere in the Agreement.
1.
Service is Not for Use by children under the age of 13 By using our Services and/or agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over the age of 13.
We encourage parents to be aware of the online habits of their children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained or received from children.
Therefore, with respect to children under the age of 13, no information should be submitted nor posted to our online sites.
In certain jurisdictions, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required from a parent or guardian for children under 18 years of age.
Upon registration in such jurisdictions, the appropriate permission form will be made available.
This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to us by fax or mail.
In some cases, we may not permit children under 18 years of age to participate in certain of our sites.
Once we have obtained parental consent, we will not require a child to disclose more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that child to participate in activity relating to the Services.
If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by us is not correct or complete, or should you wish to have your child's personal information deleted from our records, or if you want us to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact us immediately.
2.
Information we may collect, and whether this includes personally identifiable information We may collect information in two different ways: Information you Voluntarily Provide.
Personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide may be collected if it is necessary to administer the Services.
For example, when you sign up for an account or other Services that require registration or payment, we ask you for personal information such as your name, address, billing information, account name or password.
We DO NOT use your personal information other than to administer the Services.
We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.
If payment is required for the Services you have selected, we request credit card or other payment or billing information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.
The information voluntarily provided by you during the registration process may also include or naturally entail other demographic information which is not personally identifying, such as gender, preferred language, age, occupation, household income, ZIP code or country.
If you are connected to a social network service user account such as Facebook®, we automatically receive and record anonymous data such as anonymous user identifiers provided by such social network service as well as information that you have made available publicly to everybody through such social network service.
If you specifically allow us to access your social network user data such as your Facebook® user data, we automatically receive and record any information you have allowed us to access on your social network user account.
As noted below, you can opt not to disclose such information to us.
Community or Public Forums and Third Party Links.
Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as feeds, profiles, sharing and public links.
You should be aware that any personal information or Content you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account and shared files cannot be un-shared or deleted.
Our Site includes links to other third party websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Inbox.
com.
Inbox.
com has no control over the policies, actions or omissions of third party websites and is not responsible or liable for any such policies, acts or omissions.
If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by the applicable third party privacy policies and not by the Inbox privacy policy.
We urge you to carefully review the privacy policy of any website you link to, visit or share information with prior to doing so.

This information does not personally identify you.
We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website.

IP addresses are further used to help determine the number of our users to maintain efficient administration of our Services.
This demographic information may also be used by us to analyze aggregate usage behavior.

Some devices, mobile or otherwise, allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).
Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services.

4.
Security measures used to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control The security of your information and Content is important to us.
We use commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect our databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data.
These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order for us to provide, develop or improve our Services.
Security risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and we therefore cannot guarantee complete security.
5.

Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect and how it may be used, so that you can make meaningful choices.

For example, we may not remember your language preferences.
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as ZIP code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire the Services, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information.
