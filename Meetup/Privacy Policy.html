<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">to members or social media services, depending on how you engage with the Platform.&nbsp; Information that is public on our platform is accessible to others both on and off the Platform;</span></em></li>

<h3>3.1 Through Our Platform</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share some of the information that we collect by displaying it on our Platform according to your member profile and account settings. Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such as interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other members of that Meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of that group. We recommend that you check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are happy with the information that is visible to others. For more information, see this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360001655712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Account Privacy and Visibility</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360002921751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Group Content Visibility</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information that is public on our Platform is visible to others on and off the Platform.</span></p>
<h3>3.2 Group Networks</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a member of a group, this group may now or in the future become part of a network of groups known as a “Meetup Pro” network. Members who administer a Meetup Pro network, known as “network administrators” have access to the content within their groups, including information about group participants. Network administrators find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. Therefore, we will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group’s network administrator. See this article for more information about&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360002797432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Administrators, Organizers, and their Members</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

These service providers, which include data analytics providers, may access, process, and store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.</span></p>
<h3>3.4 Following The Law And Protecting Meetup</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3.5 Social Sharing And Other Tools</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. For more information, see this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360002882691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing Meetup events on Social Media</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360002878451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecting your Social Media Account</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third-party services' use of the information will be governed by the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties’ use of the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the services that provide these features.</span></p>
<h3>3.6 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Meetup is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also share information about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</span></p>
<h3>3.7 Other Situations</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer be identified. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or where we are legally entitled to do so. For example, your information may be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you when you RSVP to an event.&nbsp; Your information also is made available to other group members and event organizers when you RSVP for and participate in an event.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4.1 Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We and others may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services. See our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for details about these technologies and the information that they collect, use, or share, including how you may be able to control or disable these services.</span></p>
<h3>4.2 Transfer Of Information To The U.S. And Other Countries</h3>
<p><strong>Meetup is based in the United States</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, the U.S. and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<h3>4.3 Security</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. We use firewalls designed to protect against intruders and test for network vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update or change your password, you may select the “Forgot your password?” link on the login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.</span></p>
<h3>4.4 Data Retention</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may temporarily de-activate your account if you have not logged in for six months or more. You may contact us if you wish to reactivate your account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We retain certain information that we collect from you while you visit or are a member of the Platform, and in certain cases where you have deleted your account, for the following business purposes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you can use our Platform;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that we do not communicate with you if you have asked us not to;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide you with a refund, if entitled;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide accurate accounting information to other members about the groups that they organize or administer, and associated memberships;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand the traffic to our Platform so that we can provide all members with the best possible experience;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To detect and prevent abuse of our Platform, illegal activities and breaches of our Terms of Service; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete it or take steps to de-identify or anonymize it in accordance with applicable law.</span></p>
<h3 id="h_b87ea47b-8923-406a-a6cd-bbdcc083e47b">4.5 Policy Scope</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other members, including group organizers and network administrators, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members, including group organizers and network administrators, are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with groups, or administering networks.</span></p>
<h3>4.6 Revisions To This Policy</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this policy, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.</span></p>

<h3 id="h_796b6422-7c46-43a2-ac86-cb3259427a6d">5.2 Your Choices: Location Information</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first access the Platform, depending on your device settings, we will collect information about your location, which we use to make better recommendations for groups and events in your area, and to improve our Platform. If you do not want us to collect information about your location, then you can prevent this by taking the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If using a mobile app, by changing the settings on your device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If using our website, your approximate location information will be obtained via a cookie. Please refer to our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;for additional information on how to manage our use of cookies.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that our Platform or its features may no longer function properly if you change your settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your mobile device settings may also give you the option to choose whether to allow us to view your geolocation on a continuous basis, only when using the app, or never. Allowing us to view your geolocation when you are not using the app allows us to provide you with recommendations on a regular basis. Please refer to your device’s guide for additional information on how to adjust location services.</span></p>
<h3>5.3 Your Choices: Cookies</h3>

If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional messages, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. In addition, please consult the privacy policies of other members for information about how to control or opt out of promotional messages from them off the Platform.</span></p>
<h3>5.5 Your Choices: Photo Tagging</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can tag photos of yourself and others. When a photo has been tagged it means that the name of that person will appear alongside the photo, and the tagged photo will appear on the tagged member’s group profile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will notify you when another member has tagged your account in a photo or when additional comments are added to such photos. You can remove tags by selecting the “untag” option next to your name. You can also&nbsp;</span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360001673551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report inappropriate content</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to Meetup.
