<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Below is an overview of our&nbsp;<a href="#h_9e385395-a405-4361-8afc-854a4f586c82" target="_self">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;for our “Platform</span><span class="s3">”, which means</span><span class="s1"> any website, application, or service we offer. You should read the complete Terms of Service because that document (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement.&nbsp;<strong><em>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</em></strong></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Your Relationship with Meetup</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">By using our Platform, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service. The Terms of Service are a legally binding agreement between you and Meetup.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">If you break the rules, we may suspend or terminate your account.</span></li>

Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.</span></li>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong>You agree to follow some basic rules when using Meetup’s Platform. These rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below. We may change these rules.</span></p>

<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and </span><span class="s3">do not have a legal effect</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">These Terms of Service are an agreement between you and Meetup and not between you and any other member.

When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page.

By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement. If you do not wish to accept the revised Agreement, you can close your account. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Your Account and Membership</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:</strong></span> <span class="s1">You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform. Meetup organizers control the Content and membership of their Meetup groups. However, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.</span></p>
<p id="h_bb517931-be64-41c7-856c-25c3aeb06fde" class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.1 Eligibility.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old. You represent that you are at least 18. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform. For example, the eligibility requirements for a Meetup group or Meetup event may be set by the organizers of that group.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.2 Modification, Suspension, and Termination of Your Account.</strong></span> <span class="s1">We may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Meetup community, or to protect our brand or Platform. When this happens, we will notify you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination. We also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time. Please email policy@meetup.com if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination has occurred in error.</span></p>

Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account). </span><span class="s3">We strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account. </span><span class="s1">You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone is using your password</span><span class="s3"> or accessing your account without your permission,</span><span class="s1"> email us at abuse@meetup.com.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.4 License to the Meetup Platform and Services</strong>. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Meetup grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Platform in order to access and use the services and features that we make available to you.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">3. Fees, Payments, and Offers</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:</strong></span> <span class="s1">We charge for certain features on our Platform. If you’re a Meetup group organizer, you’re responsible for paying for organizer subscription fees related to your Meetup group. These fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future. Additionally, some organizers charge money for participation in a Meetup group or Meetup event.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.1 Fees Charged by Meetup.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features. We may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform. If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you notice in advance </span><span class="s3">such as</span><span class="s1"> by posting changes on our Platform</span><span class="s3"> or</span><span class="s1"> sending you an email. You agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S. dollars. Organizer subscriptions are non-transferable. Members based in the European Union may cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our Platform. However, if you use the service, you may be charged for services provided during this 14-day period. Please note that this 14-day period begins when the service starts even if you are using a free trial. Users based in the European Union can exercise their cancellation right by emailing us at policy@meetup.com. See the <a href="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/7/highres_482807191.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model cancellation form here</a>.</span></p>
<p id="h_28ea1347-6938-4558-ae73-2a151791bf3a" class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Organizers may impose fees related to particular portions of the Platform, such as member dues for a Meetup group or an event fee for a Meetup event. We reserve the right to initiate refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service. Refunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/"><span class="s2">Payment Policies</span></a></span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s1"> Organizers </span><span class="s3">may also have</span><span class="s1"> their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit members’ ability to receive refunds under our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/"><span class="s2">Payment Policies</span></a>. Payments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider. If a member pays a fee to an organizer via the Platform, the member authorizes the organizer (and the organizer’s applicable payment service provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges. Certain types of fees charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis. If billed on a recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to the designated payment method. You may cancel auto-renewal at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">You should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to any organizer. We cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they promise or as you expect. You should check the refund policy of the Meetup group before making any payments to an organizer.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.3 Payments to Meetup.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Organizers are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to Meetup on time and through our approved payment methods. Organizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the organizer of the Meetup groups associated with their account, and their Meetup group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that Meetup group) may be terminated or transferred to another member. You may only pay organizer fees to Meetup using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform. </span><span class="s3">If we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees paid to Meetup. In addition, if you paid your organizer fees through the Meetup app for iOS, your payment is subject to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html"><span class="s7">Apple Media Services Terms</span></a> and Conditions, and you will need to submit your request for a refund to Apple. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1">You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Platform. You authorize us (and our designated third-party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the </span><span class="s3">total</span><span class="s1"> amount of any fees you owe to Meetup, including any applicable taxes and other charges. If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled. We reserve the right to adjust, or to instruct our payment processors to make adjustments to a payment that has already been requested or received, in order to correct errors or mistakes, or </span><span class="s3">to issue refunds, in accordance with our&nbsp;Payment Policies.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">To learn more about organizer subscriptions and what happens if they expire, see this&nbsp;<a href="/hc/articles/360002883171-What-if-my-organizer-subscription-expires"><span class="s2">FAQ on Expired Plans</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.4 Automatic Subscription Renewals.</strong> Fees for certain aspects of our Platform may be billed on either a recurring basis or on a one-time basis. If billed on a recurring basis, the fees are payable in advance of the applicable period specified via the Platform with no refunds. We will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. By purchasing any feature or other aspect of our Platform for which we charge, you authorize us to keep your payment current by charging the applicable fee to your credit card account (or any other means of payment used by you). While you may cancel auto-renewal or cancel your subscription at any time, refunds will be issued solely pursuant to our <a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882931-Meetup-subscription-refund-policy"><span class="s2">Subscription Refund Policy</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">To cancel your organizer subscription, see this&nbsp;<a href="/hc/articles/360002883151-How-do-I-cancel-my-organizer-subscription"><span class="s2">FAQ on Modifying Subscriptions</span></a></span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.5 Free Trials.</strong> We may offer free trials of subscriptions and other products on our Platform. We will inform you of the length of the free trial, your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment. After your free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. You can cancel automatic subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures described above. Users based in the European Union are entitled to cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our Platform by emailing us at policy@meetup.com. See the <a href="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/7/highres_482807191.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model cancellation form here</a>. Please note that this 14-day period begins when the free trial starts.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.6 Third Party Payment Processors.</strong></span> <span class="s1">An organizer that uses the Platform to accept payments from other members must comply with the terms and conditions of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment. Meetup does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.7 Invoices from Third Parties.</strong> In line with the tax laws of the country where an organizer is using the Platform, an organizer may receive Meetup invoices from a third party provider. Such third party provider invoicing does not in any way impact the rights and obligations agreed to in this Agreement, nor does it impact the fee being charged for the use of the Platform.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s3">9. </span><span class="s1">Dispute Resolution</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:</strong></span> <span class="s1">If you have a dispute with Meetup, you agree to try to work it out directly with us first.</span> <span class="s1">If we can’t work it out, with limited exceptions, you must submit any dispute with us to a neutral arbitrator instead of taking the claim to a court of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.&nbsp;Members based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law. Meetup has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other members, although we may try to facilitate a resolution. </span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.1 Informal Resolution.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Before making any claim, you and Meetup agree to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. We use the term “claim” in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation in Meetup events. You or Meetup may initiate this process by sending written notice according to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution. In the event that we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days following receipt of the initial notice, you or Meetup may bring a claim in accordance with this Section 9. Members based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p10 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s8"><strong>9.2 Arbitration Agreement.</strong></span><span class="s1"> The arbitration procedures described in this Section 9.2 applies to all members, except for members who are based in the European Union. Section 9.6 sets out the dispute resolution procedures that apply to members who are based in the European Union.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>a. Mandatory Arbitration. </strong>Except as set forth in Section 9.3, you agree to submit any claim to JAMS, Inc., or its successor (“JAMS”) for final and binding arbitration.&nbsp;In arbitration, certain rights that you or we would have in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal. You and Meetup are each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law.&nbsp;This agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises during or after any termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Meetup.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>b. Arbitration Time for Filing.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Any claim subject to arbitration must be filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>c. Arbitration Procedures.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><span class="s2">JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures</span></a>&nbsp;and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires (“JAMS Rules”) that are in effect as of the demand for arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes. The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.3 Exceptions.</strong></span> <span class="s1">You or Meetup may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any U.S. county where you live or work. You or Meetup may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Meetup pending the completion of arbitration. Meetup may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Meetup’s right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.4 Arbitration Opt Out.</strong> <strong>You may decline to resolve disputes through arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@meetup.com within 30 days of the date you first agree to this Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;Your email must include your full name, residential address, the email address registered to your Meetup account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out according to this process, then Section 9.2</span><span class="s3"> of this Agreement does not apply to you. This opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.3 (Exceptions), 9.5 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s3"><strong>9.5 Class Action Waiver.</strong> </span><span class="s1">You agree to resolve disputes with Meetup on an individual basis. You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.&nbsp;<strong>You are expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.6 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Members Based in the EU.</strong> If you are a member based in the European Union, the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply. Nothing in this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions of the local law that applies. If you are based in the European Union, the local laws in your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against Meetup in your Member State and to invoke certain local laws against Meetup.

<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>11.9 No Waiver.</strong></span> <span class="s1">A party’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision and does not waive any right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>11.10 Severance.</strong></span> <span class="s1">If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you and Meetup nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>11.11 Thank you.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Please accept our wholehearted thanks for reading our Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>11.12 Termination.</strong></span> <span class="s1">If we terminate your account or access to our Platform, this Agreement terminates with respect to the member account that has been terminated, provided that the provisions listed in Section 11.13 will survive such termination.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>11.13 Survival.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Sections 3 (Fees, Payments, and Offers), 4.2 (Content License from You), 4.3 (Privacy), 6 (Release), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability), 9 (Dispute Resolution), and 11 (General Terms) of this Agreement, and any other provisions necessary to give effect to these provisions, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</span></p>
