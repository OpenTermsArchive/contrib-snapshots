You should read the complete Terms of Service because that document (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement.&nbsp;<strong><em>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</em></strong></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Your Relationship with Meetup</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">By using our Platform, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service. The Terms of Service are a legally binding agreement between you and Meetup.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">If you break the rules, we may suspend or terminate your account.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">We charge for certain aspects of our Platform, and some of these fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription).</span></li>

You also agree to resolve any disputes you may have with us in the manner described in the Terms of Service. Unless you are based in the European Union, you agree to mandatory arbitration and waive your right to seek relief from a judge or jury in a court of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">You may be based in a country where the laws that apply provide for different or additional rights and obligations. These Terms of Service will point out areas of difference.</span></li>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Terms of Service contain important information about your legal rights. To make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these gray boxes.

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">1. This Agreement</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong>You agree to follow some basic rules when using Meetup’s Platform. These rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below. We may change these rules.</span></p>

The terms “Meetup,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Meetup, Inc. and our corporate parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. We use the terms “you” and “your” to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf. We use the word “Platform” to mean any website, application, or service offered by Meetup, including content we offer and electronic communications we send. We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service. We use the terms “Terms of Service” and “Agreement” interchangeably to mean this document together with our&nbsp;<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360002897532" target="_self">Usage and Content Policies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712" target="_self">Groups and Events Policies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913291" target="_self">Organizer and Leadership Standards</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002913271" target="_self">Member Restrictions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/"><span class="s2">Payment Policies</span></a>, <a href="/hc/articles/360001655932-Meetup-Trademark-Guidelines"><span class="s2">Trademark Usage Guidelines</span></a></span><span class="s3">, and <a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/articles/360028705532" target="_self">API License Terms</a></span><span class="s1">.

If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement. If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and </span><span class="s3">do not have a legal effect</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">These Terms of Service are an agreement between you and Meetup and not between you and any other member. For more information, see our&nbsp;<a href="/hc/articles/360002860032-Is-the-Terms-of-Service-an-agreement-between-Organizers-and-members"><span class="s2">FAQ page explaining the parties to our Terms of Service</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>1.2 Revisions to this Agreement.</strong></span> <span class="s1">We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement. If you do not wish to accept the revised Agreement, you can close your account. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Your Account and Membership</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:</strong></span> <span class="s1">You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform. Meetup organizers control the Content and membership of their Meetup groups. However, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.</span></p>
<p id="h_bb517931-be64-41c7-856c-25c3aeb06fde" class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.1 Eligibility.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old. You represent that you are at least 18. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform. For example, the eligibility requirements for a Meetup group or Meetup event may be set by the organizers of that group.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.2 Modification, Suspension, and Termination of Your Account.</strong></span> <span class="s1">We may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Meetup community, or to protect our brand or Platform. When this happens, we will notify you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination. We also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time. Please email policy@meetup.com if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination has occurred in error.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1">A member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our Platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.3 Account Information and Security.</strong></span> <span class="s1">When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password. Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account). </span><span class="s3">We strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account. </span><span class="s1">You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone is using your password</span><span class="s3"> or accessing your account without your permission,</span><span class="s1"> email us at abuse@meetup.com.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>2.4 License to the Meetup Platform and Services</strong>. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Meetup grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Platform in order to access and use the services and features that we make available to you.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">3. Fees, Payments, and Offers</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>Summary:</strong></span> <span class="s1">We charge for certain features on our Platform. If you’re a Meetup group organizer, you’re responsible for paying for organizer subscription fees related to your Meetup group. These fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future. Additionally, some organizers charge money for participation in a Meetup group or Meetup event.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.1 Fees Charged by Meetup.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features. We may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform. If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you notice in advance </span><span class="s3">such as</span><span class="s1"> by posting changes on our Platform</span><span class="s3"> or</span><span class="s1"> sending you an email. You agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S. dollars. Organizer subscriptions are non-transferable. Members based in the European Union may cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our Platform. However, if you use the service, you may be charged for services provided during this 14-day period. Please note that this 14-day period begins when the service starts even if you are using a free trial. Users based in the European Union can exercise their cancellation right by emailing us at policy@meetup.com. See the <a href="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/7/highres_482807191.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model cancellation form here</a>.</span></p>
<p id="h_28ea1347-6938-4558-ae73-2a151791bf3a" class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Organizers may impose fees related to particular portions of the Platform, such as member dues for a Meetup group or an event fee for a Meetup event. We reserve the right to initiate refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service. Refunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/"><span class="s2">Payment Policies</span></a></span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s1"> Organizers </span><span class="s3">may also have</span><span class="s1"> their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit members’ ability to receive refunds under our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/paypolicies/"><span class="s2">Payment Policies</span></a>. Payments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider. If a member pays a fee to an organizer via the Platform, the member authorizes the organizer (and the organizer’s applicable payment service provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges. Certain types of fees charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis. If billed on a recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to the designated payment method. You may cancel auto-renewal at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p6 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> <span class="s1">You should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to any organizer.

<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.3 Payments to Meetup.</strong></span> <span class="s1">Organizers are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to Meetup on time and through our approved payment methods. Organizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the organizer of the Meetup groups associated with their account, and their Meetup group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that Meetup group) may be terminated or transferred to another member. You may only pay organizer fees to Meetup using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform. </span><span class="s3">If we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees paid to Meetup.

If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled. We reserve the right to adjust, or to instruct our payment processors to make adjustments to a payment that has already been requested or received, in order to correct errors or mistakes, or </span><span class="s3">to issue refunds, in accordance with our&nbsp;Payment Policies.</span></p>

<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>3.7 Invoices from Third Parties.</strong> In line with the tax laws of the country where an organizer is using the Platform, an organizer may receive Meetup invoices from a third party provider.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes. The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.3 Exceptions.</strong></span> <span class="s1">You or Meetup may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any U.S. county where you live or work. You or Meetup may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Meetup pending the completion of arbitration. Meetup may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Meetup’s right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.</span></p>
<p class="p7 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.4 Arbitration Opt Out.</strong> <strong>You may decline to resolve disputes through arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@meetup.com within 30 days of the date you first agree to this Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;Your email must include your full name, residential address, the email address registered to your Meetup account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out according to this process, then Section 9.2</span><span class="s3"> of this Agreement does not apply to you. This opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.3 (Exceptions), 9.5 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).</span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s3"><strong>9.5 Class Action Waiver.</strong> </span><span class="s1">You agree to resolve disputes with Meetup on an individual basis. You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.&nbsp;<strong>You are expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2 wysiwyg-indent2"><span class="s1"><strong>9.6 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Members Based in the EU.</strong> If you are a member based in the European Union, the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply. Nothing in this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions of the local law that applies. If you are based in the European Union, the local laws in your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against Meetup in your Member State and to invoke certain local laws against Meetup. The European Commission provides for an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr"><span class="s2">online dispute resolution platform</span></a>.</span></p>
