Where payment is required, the following additional terms and conditions will apply.<br>
<strong>
<em>Billing and Payment</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> Plentyoffish will use the credit card information You provide to bill You for goods and services.
By registering for the Paid Memberships or Paid Features and providing Your credit card details, You agree to be billed by us for Your for-fee service in advance.
It is Your sole obligation to provide accurate and complete credit card information, and to timely update Your Account with any changes to such information.
Customers with billing addresses outside Canada confirm that they are not residents of Canada and are not registered for purposes of Canadian goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST).<br>
<strong>
<em>In App Purchases</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> From time to time, Plentyoffish may offer additional products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through the App Store â„  or other application platforms authorized by Plentyoffish (each, a “Software Store”).
If You choose to make an in app purchase, You will be prompted to enter details for Your account with the mobile platform You are using (e.g., Apple, Android, etc.) (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to You at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account.
If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until You cancel in accordance with the platform terms.
In all cases, please refer to the terms of Your application platform which apply to Your in app purchases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Tokens and Other Virtual Items</em>
</strong>
<br> From time to time, You may be able to purchase, with “real world” money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use “virtual items”, including but not limited to tokens that are redeemable for other virtual items, such as Super Yeses and Highlighter (collectively, “Virtual Items”).
You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service and not in any other way.
Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement.
Some Virtual Items may only be used during a set period of time, and upon expiration of the time period any unused Virtual Items expire.
In some cases, we may redeem any unused Virtual Items ourselves at expiration and provide You the feature(s) related thereto so you have no unused Virtual Items when the license period expires, although we are not obligated to do so.
Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Virtual Items obtained by You are licensed to You, and You hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned hereunder.
This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items.
Any Virtual Item balance shown in Your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license.
Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use.
provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, when Plentyoffish ceases providing the Service or this Agreement or Your Account is otherwise terminated.
Plentyoffish, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.
Purchase and use of Virtual Items through a Software Store are subject to such Software Store’s terms of service and privacy policy.
Plentyoffish may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time.
Plentyoffish shall have no liability to You or any third party in the event that Plentyoffish exercises any such rights.
The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and You shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity.
Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service.
ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
The provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service provided by Plentyoffish that commences immediately upon the acceptance of Your purchase of such Virtual Items.
You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by You or anyone using your Plentyoffish account.
Plentyoffish may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PLENTYOFFISH IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.<br>
<strong>
<em>Automatic Renewal</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> Paid Memberships are subscriptions.
After Your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, Your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price You agreed to when subscribing.
You agree that Your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.
If You do not wish Your account to renew automatically, or if You want to change or terminate Your subscription, please log in and go to Your Account page and opt out of automatic renewal of Your purchase.
If You opt out of automatic renewal after Your purchase, You may use Your subscription until the end of Your then-current subscription term.
Your subscription will not be renewed after Your then-current term expires.
You won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.
Paid Memberships cannot be transferred to any other account.
By subscribing to the Paid Membership, You authorize Plentyoffish to bill the credit card You provided now and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period.
You also authorize Plentyoffish to charge You for any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on Your subscription payments.<br>
<strong>
<em>Reaffirmation of Authorization</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> Your non-termination or continued use of the Paid Memberships reaffirms that Plentyoffish is authorized to charge the credit card information provided.
Plentyoffish may submit those charges for payment and You will be responsible for such charges.
This does not waive Plentyoffish’s right to seek payment directly from You.
Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when You initially subscribed to the Paid Memberships<br>
<strong>
<em>Termination of Services for Non-Payment</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> Where payment is required for a Paid Membership or Paid Feature and we are unable to charge Your credit card for any reason, we may discontinue any and all Services to You either temporarily or permanently.<br>
<strong>
<em>Cancellation of Services</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
<br> If You cancel Your account, Your Paid Membership and/or Paid Features will be cancelled unless You used PayPal to complete Your purchase.
If You used PayPal to pay for Your Paid Membership and/or Paid Features, You must contact or login to PayPal to cancel Your account.
unfortunately, Plentyoffish is not able to do this on behalf of PayPal users.
Most payments for Paid Memberships and Paid Features are non-refundable.
You will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the unused paid services.
Where billing for a service is recurring on a monthly, yearly or other periodic basis, the unused portion of the current service period will not be refunded.
Paid Memberships and/or Paid Features cannot be transferred to any other account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Refunds</em>
</strong>
<br> Refunds.
Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
We may make an exception if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.
</p>

Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.

In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of Plentyoffish) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.</p>
<p>PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>

<strong>ARBITRATION.
GOVERNING LAW</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Website shall be <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</li>
<li>By using the Website or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, <strong>YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT</strong> to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). <strong>YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING</strong>.
Your rights will be determined by a <strong>NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY</strong>, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</li>
<li>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</li>
<li>This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>
<br> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and be enforceable.
You may not assign, transfer or sublicense this Agreement without the prior written consent of Plentyoffish.
Plentyoffish may assign this Agreement in whole or in part.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement.
