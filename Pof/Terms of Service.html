</li>
<li>
<strong>Purchases</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>In App Purchases.</strong> From time to time, POF may offer products and services for purchase ("in app purchases") through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by POF (each, a "Software Store").
If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store ("your IAP Account"), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account.
Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live.
If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel.
After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing.
If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the POF application from your device.
Deleting your account on POF or deleting the POF application from your device does not cancel your subscription.
POF will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>POF Direct Purchases.</strong>If you choose to make a purchase through pof.com, pof.fr, any other POF website or the POF app on Google Play without using your IAP Account ("POF Direct"), you agree to pay POF all charges at the prices displayed to you for the services you've selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and you authorize POF to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method").
POF may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, POF may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.
You are always responsible for providing accurate and complete billing information.
If your billing address is outside Canada, you confirm that you (a) are not a resident of Canada, (b) are not registered for purposes of Canadian goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST), (c) will be outside Canada at all times that you access POF's website and exercise you membership rights, and (d) will update your billing address with POF to a Canadian billing address if any of the above changes.<br> If you purchase a subscription through POF Direct, your subscription will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you.
After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing, until you cancel.
You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.
If you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log in and go to "Account" on POF Direct and follow the instructions.
If you used PayPal to make purchases, you must contact or login to PayPal to cancel your subscription.
unfortunately, POF is not able to do this on behalf of PayPal users.
If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.<br> If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tokens and Other Virtual Items.</strong> From time to time, you may be able to purchase, with "real world" money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use "virtual items," including but not limited to tokens that are redeemable for other virtual items, such as Super Yes and Highlight (collectively, "Virtual Items").
You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service and not in any other way.
Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement.
Some Virtual Items may only be used during a set period of time, and upon expiration of the time period, any unused Virtual Items expire.
In some cases, we may redeem any unused Virtual Items ourselves at expiration and provide you the feature(s) related thereto so you have no unused Virtual Items when the license period expires, although we are not obligated to do so.
Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Virtual Items obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned hereunder.
This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items.
Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.
Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use.
provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, when POF ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise terminated.
POF, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.
Purchase and use of Virtual Items through a Software Store are subject to such Software Store's terms of service and privacy policy.
POF may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time.
POF shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that POF exercises any such rights.
The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity.
Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service.
ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
The provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service provided by POF that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT POF IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Refunds.</strong> Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods unless the laws applicable to your jurisdiction mandatorily provide for refunds.
<br>
<br> For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins.
Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.<br>
<br> For POF subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, the terms below apply:<br>
<br> You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed.
In the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death.
In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of POF) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.<br>
<br> Purchases of Virtual Items are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.<br>
<br> To request a refund: <br> If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not POF.
To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select "Purchase history," find the transaction and hit "Report Problem".
You can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.<br>
<br> For all other users, you may request a refund by contacting csr@pof.com.

<li>
<strong>Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</strong>
<p> Except for users residing within the EU or European Economic Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law: </p>
<ol>
<li>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</li>
<li>By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).
YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</li>
<li>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</li>
<li>This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
<li>The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr.
POF does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Governing Law</strong>
<p> For users residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services.
For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Venue</strong>
<p> Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area, who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A., and you and POF consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Indemnity by You</strong>
<p> You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless POF, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney's fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.

Other</strong>

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
You agree that your POF account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate upon your death.
No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind POF in any manner.
