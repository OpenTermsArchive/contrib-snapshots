</p> PLENTYOFFISH PRIVACY POLICY <br> This privacy policy (this “Policy”) describes the practices Plentyoffish Media Inc., and any affiliates (as that term is defined in the British Columbia Business Corporations Act), (collectively “we”, “us”, “our”) with respect to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information provided to us from users of our Website.
This Policy forms an integral part of Terms of Use Agreement, which is incorporated by reference.
Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Policy will have the meaning defined in the Terms of Use Agreement.
<p>
</p> All references to “Website” in this Policy refer to our websites located at www.plentyoffish.com and www.pof.com.
INTRODUCTION We respect and uphold individual rights to privacy and the protection of personal information.
We know how important it is to protect your personal information and want to make every customer experience safe and secure.
In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
<p>
</p> For the purposes of this Policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, including, for example, an individual’s height, birth date, name, home address, telephone number, social insurance number, sex, income and marital status.
We will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with this Policy, or in accordance with laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us (“Applicable Privacy Laws”).
<p>
</p> We have appointed a Privacy Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this Policy.
Information on how to contact the Privacy Officer can be found below.
COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We collect two types of information through our Website: personal information and non-personal information.
The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.
<i>Personal information</i> We may collect personal information such as: <p>
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>	a.
your contact information – for example, your name and email address;</ol>
<ol>	b.
your personal preferences – for example, language preferences, and marketing consent.
and</ol>
<ol>	c.
your profile information – for example, photographs you upload, and other information you provide in your personal profile, such as your interests, marital status, your height, weight and occupation.</ol>
<i>Non-personal information</i> Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual.
For example: <p>
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>	a.
we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Website, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL.
or</ol>
<ol>	b.
we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes.
We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of users are male, aged 18 to 25.</ol>
<p>
</p> You may choose not to provide us with your personal information.
However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the service, or information that you requested.
For example, we require your email address in order to verify your account, which is necessary so that notifications may be sent to you electronically.
Should you no longer wish to receive notifications from Plentyoffish when you receive a message from another Plentyoffish user or when another user adds you as a favorite, you may turn these notifications off through Mail Settings (http://www.pof.com/mailsettings.aspx).
Plentyoffish will not send you notifications after your account is deleted.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We may use your personal information for a number of different business purposes, for example to: <p>
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>	a.
create and display your online dating profile to other users of the Website;</ol>
<ol>	b.
show other users when you have viewed their profiles;</ol>
<ol>	c.
compare your profile and preferences with that of other users to provide both you and other users with potential matches;</ol>
<ol>	d.
provide customer support to assist you with your questions or complaints.

<ol>	i.
track and analyze your preferences to better understand your service needs and eligibility.
and</ol>
<ol>	j.
for other purposes as described in this Policy.
</ol>
<p>
</p> We limit the personal information we collect and use to that which is necessary to fulfill our business purposes.
We will not collect, sell, distribute or use personal information for any other purposes without your further consent, as required by law or as authorized by Applicable Privacy Laws.
YOUR CONSENT We will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by Applicable Privacy Laws.
When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.
<i>Express Consent</i> Sometimes you will be asked to give your express consent to our collection, use or disclosure of personal information – for example, by being asked to check a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications.
<i>Implied Consent</i> Other times, you may provide your implied consent to our collection, use or disclosure of personal information when we can reasonably conclude that you have given consent by some action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take.
Generally, this occurs where the purpose for the use of your personal information would be reasonably apparent to you – for example, when you provide us with personal information through forms to populate your online dating profile, you provide us with implied consent to publish that information for other users of the Website to view.
<i>Withdrawing Your Consent</i> You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure or your information.
We will accommodate your request subject to legal and contractual restrictions.
INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT DIRECTLY FROM YOU Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.
<i>Follow-Up and Surveys</i> From time to time, we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your use of the Website, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied.
<p>
</p> We may use contact information collected online to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research.
These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.
<i>Our Website</i> Our Website can be browsed anonymously.
However, to engage in certain special features or functions of our Website, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your email address or demographic information.
We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your account, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Website that you choose to use.
<i>Advertising Campaigns</i> To supplement our website, we rely on advertisers who wish to serve advertisements to some or all of our users (“Campaigns”) to generate revenue.
We never share your personal information with our advertisers for their Campaigns.
However, we will use elements of your personal information to create a list of users that advertisers may want to direct their Campaigns to.
Advertisers may decide to serve advertisements to all of our users (“General Campaigns”), or to send messages to specific segments of our user base (“Direct Campaigns”) based on particular personal characteristics (for example, age, sex or geographic location).
In the case of Direct Campaigns, we may use different elements of your personal preferences to develop and display advertising content tailored to your preferences.
<i>Matching</i> From time to time we will use some elements of your personal information (such as your personal preferences or your profile information) to generate and send you a list of possible matches from among our other users.
<i>Customer Support Centre</i> We operate an electronic customer support centre to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints.
When you contact our customer support centre, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity.
For example if you need to make a change to your account, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder.
We may also monitor or record your online or telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.

Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site.
For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site, to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience.

We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others.
None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.
For our own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users.
Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy.

When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource.
We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect and use your personal information.
SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided us.
This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.
DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION We do not sell or license your personal information to any other party.
However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information with our affiliates and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by Applicable Privacy Laws.
<i>Service Providers</i> We may use third party service providers (for example, web hosting providers, data management providers and/or payment processers) to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information.
When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION The security of your personal information is a high priority for us.
We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.
For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers.
we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords.
and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information.
Reasonably secure methods are used whenever we destroy personal information.
For example, we currently use SSL encryption with a 2048 bit RSA key digital certificate.
