<ul>
<li>
<u>App Usage Information</u>.
Xfinity Mobile Service apps covered by this Privacy Policy may allow you to store certain details and preferences ("Preference Data").
We do this so that you do not have to enter this data every time you return to an Xfinity Mobile Service app.

</p>

</ul>Information Provided by Third Parties<p>We also obtain information about you from third parties.
For example, when you request new or additional services or phone lines from us, we may obtain credit information from credit reporting agencies.

Use of Customer Information<p>Comcast uses Customer Information in both de-identified and aggregated forms to provide and support the Xfinity Mobile Service.
We process and use this data for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with Xfinity Mobile Service by routing your calls, messages, and Internet traffic;</li>
<li>Analyzing, customizing, measuring, and improving the Xfinity Mobile Service;</li>

and</li>
<li>Updating any programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with the Xfinity Mobile Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comcast may use Customer Information for internal business purposes, such as to measure and analyze use of the Xfinity Mobile network and Internet traffic related to your Xfinity Mobile Service usage in Wi-Fi mode, as well as for supplier reporting and assessment of service levels, and to better understand how the Xfinity Mobile Service is used.
We may also use Customer Information to create audience segments that are based on particular interests and/or characteristics shared by those in the segment.
We may use that information to provide advertisements and promotional opportunities to you, when we have any required consent to do so.</p>
<p>We may also use location information to provide you with a customized experience, when we have any required consent to do so.
For example, if we provide 411 Directory Assistance, we might use your wireless location information to provide you the number of the business location closest to you.</p>4.
Sharing and Disclosures of InformationThird Parties<p>We will not share, sell, license, rent, or otherwise permit access to Customer Information that individually and personally identifies you to an unaffiliated third party for that third party to market their products or services to you, unless we have any required consent to do so.</p>
<p>Comcast uses third parties to assist us in delivering parts of Xfinity Mobile Service to you, including third parties who assist us with billing and collections, analytics and research, marketing, service delivery and customization, maintenance and operations, incident verification and response, service notifications, fraud prevention, and services to improve our programming and advertising offerings.
Third parties include outside auditors, professional advisors, technicians, and other service providers and vendors.
We may provide Customer Information to these third parties to the extent necessary for them to provide these services.
These companies are acting on Comcast's behalf and are required, by contract with Comcast, to keep Customer Information confidential and are restricted from using it for any other purposes.
For example, Comcast may use third parties to process payments for us and may share your payment information with those third-party billing processors.
Or, Comcast may use a third party to obtain and process Customer Information and assess your credit and payment risk and to determine how many devices can be made available to you on your Xfinity Mobile Service account.</p>
<p>Comcast does not permit these third parties to use Customer Information for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Comcast may also share de-identified or aggregate Customer Information with third parties.
For example, Comcast may share de-identified data from the Xfinity Mobile Service network with third parties that measure and analyze the use of the service.</p>
<p>Comcast also transmits wireless calling name and number information for CallerID so that your name and/or telephone number may be displayed on a Caller ID device.</p>
<p>Comcast may share Customer Information if it enters into a Business Transition as described in Section 11 below.</p>Disclosures Required by Law or to Protect Comcast and Others<p>Comcast holds customer privacy in the highest regard, and we make every reasonable effort to protect your privacy as described in this Privacy Policy.
Nevertheless, we may be required by law to disclose Customer Information, including information about your use of the Xfinity Mobile Service.
These disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
If Comcast is required to disclose Customer Information that identifies you to a private third party in response to a civil court order, we will notify you prior to making such disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so.
</p>
<p>We may also disclose information about you or users of the Xfinity Mobile Service when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of such information is necessary to enforce our rights under our terms of service and policies, address suspected illegal activity, secure our services or network, protect our rights or property, or in emergency situations to prevent imminent physical harm.</p>Account Owners and Users<p>If you are a user on an Xfinity Mobile Service account, you should know that Comcast may disclose Customer Information to the primary account owner, because that person is authorized to access information about all devices and lines on the Xfinity Mobile Service account.
The primary account owner may also authorize other users to access information on the Xfinity Mobile Service account, and that may include data about you and your use of Xfinity Mobile Service.</p>The Comcast Family of Businesses<p>Comcast may share Customer Information including CPNI with its affiliates that help it operate Xfinity Mobile Service, to provide you with the Xfinity Mobile Service, and to provide you with other Xfinity products and services.
For example, if you use Xfinity Mobile Service in connection with other Xfinity services (for example, when you access Xfinity Wi-Fi with your Xfinity Mobile device or watch videos using Xfinity Stream), we may share your Customer Information with the Comcast Companies that offer those services.
We do this so that these companies can provide services to you and to make it easier for you to use Xfinity Mobile Service and other Xfinity services, like Xfinity Stream, seamlessly.
We may also share your Customer Information with other Comcast Companies for marketing and advertising purposes when we have any required consent to do so.</p>5.
Access to Your Customer Information<p>You may review and update your Customer Information by accessing Xfinity Mobile My Account online.
If you need our help to correct or remove information, please contact us.
We will respond to your request within 30 days.
In some cases, we may not be able to correct or remove Customer Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>If you make an affirmative, written request for a copy of your CPNI, we will disclose the relevant information we have to you at your account address of record, or to any person authorized by you, if we reasonably believe the request is valid.
However, subscribers to Xfinity Mobile Service should be aware that we generally do not provide them with records of any inbound or outbound calls or other records that we don't furnish in the ordinary course of business (for example, as part of a bill) or which are available only from our archives, without valid legal process such as a court order.</p>
<p>We will retain Customer Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Xfinity Mobile Service, and as otherwise necessary to help us improve our products and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with you.</p>6.
The Choices You Have With Respect to Your Customer Information<p>In many instances, you have the right to make choices with respect to how Comcast uses, shares, or permits access to certain Customer Information about you.
The choices available to you are detailed below, along with instructions about how to make your choices.
Any choice you make to grant, deny, or withdraw your consent for any use, disclosure, or access to Customer Information about you is valid until you tell us otherwise.
If you restrict your consent for us to use Customer Information about you in accordance with the choices available to you, you will experience no effect, now or in the future, on how we provide any services to which you subscribe.</p>
<p>From time to time, Comcast may launch programs that use Customer Information and may require your opt-in consent, such as customer loyalty programs and certain data collection programs.
In such case, Comcast will provide you with separate written information about the program, as well as how to opt in to (and subsequently opt out of) any such program, if applicable.</p>
<p>Additionally, regardless of the choices you make about your Customer Information, when you initiate a real-time interaction with a Comcast representative, such as a telephone call or a chat session, you may be asked for your oral consent to Comcast's use of certain Customer Information for the purpose of providing you with additional services, promotional offers, or savings.
If you provide your consent for Comcast to do so, Comcast may use such information only for the duration of that interaction and only for those purposes.</p>
<p>We may also provide you with information about goods and services provided by unrelated third parties that may be of interest to you.
Information about how to manage or limit these communications is provided below.
</p>How to Manage the E-mail Communications Comcast Sends to You<p>We may send service-related announcements to our subscribers from time to time, as well as promotional or commercial e-mail as permitted by applicable law.
You may not opt out of service-related communications.
If you fail to check your primary e-mail address for service-related announcements, you may miss important information about our services, including legal notices, for example.
You can, however, manage and limit the promotional or commercial e-mails Comcast may send to you by following the instructions contained in the e-mails or by going to my.xfinity.com/mobile, logging in to Xfinity Mobile Service My Account, navigating to the "Service Settings" tab, and following the directions there.</p>
<p>The Xfinity Mobile Service My Account page may allow you to provide additional information such as your zip code.
This information will allow us to better inform you of special offers and promotions in your area.</p>How to Place Yourself on Comcast's "Do Not Call" and "Do Not Mail" Lists<p>You may contact Comcast at 1-800-XFINITY to ask us to put your name on our internal company "do not call" and "do not mail" lists so that you do not receive marketing or promotional telephone calls or postal mail from us or made at our request.
</p>
<p>If you prefer to contact Comcast in writing instead of by telephone, you may send a written request to the address listed below under "How do I contact Comcast?" Be sure to include your name and address, your Xfinity Mobile Service account number, and a daytime telephone number where you can be reached in the event we have any questions about your request.
The person who is identified in our billing records as the subscriber should sign the written request.
If you have a joint account, a request by one party will apply to the entire account.
If you have multiple accounts, your notice must separately identify each account covered by the request.</p>How to Limit Use of Your Location Information to Connect Automatically to Xfinity Wi-Fi Hotspots.<p>When you have "Advanced Wi-Fi Settings" in your device turned on, Comcast uses your location to locate an Xfinity Wi-Fi access point near you and automatically connect your device to the Internet using Xfinity Wi-Fi.
You may turn this function off in the "Advanced Wi-Fi Settings" in your device.</p>7.
Security<p>Comcast uses reasonable industry-standard practices designed to securely store, control access to, make appropriate use of, and prevent unauthorized access to, Customer Information, and we require our contractors and other providers to do so as well.
However, no security measure is completely effective, and Comcast cannot guarantee the complete security of Customer Information.
If you have any questions about security when using Xfinity Mobile Service, you can contact us.</p>
<p>Neither Comcast nor any of our authorized service providers will ask for your Comcast password in an e-mail, over the telephone, or in an online support forum or chat area.
Do not give your Comcast password to anyone in an e-mail, over the telephone, or in an online support area.</p>8.
Customer Information Subject to Additional Protection Under Federal Law<p>When we collect Customer Information, additional protections apply under United States telecommunications law and are reflected in this Privacy Policy, including protections for Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI").
CPNI is defined in Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and includes but is not limited to, the phone numbers that you call and that call you, the times and dates of those call, location information, billing and payment history, and service information and rate and data plans you use.
Those additional protections and the choices you have regarding the use and sharing of such information are reflected in this Privacy Policy.
Comcast does not collect or store the content of your communications for any purpose other than to provide its services or as otherwise required by law.</p>9.
Special Note About Children<p>Comcast does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 through the Xfinity Mobile Service.
Children should always get permission from a parent or legal guardian before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over a wireless network or the Internet, to Comcast or to anyone else.</p>
<p>If you allow a child to use the Xfinity Mobile Service (either by using your device or by obtaining a line for that child on your Xfinity Mobile Service account), be aware that the child's personal information could be collected as described in the Privacy Policy.
When that happens, information collected appears to us to be associated with the adult customer who subscribes to Xfinity Mobile Service and will be treated as the adult's information under this Policy.</p>10.
Your California Privacy Rights<p>California law permits its residents to request and receive information about a business' disclosure of certain categories of personally identifiable information to other companies for their use for direct marketing.
If you are a California resident and a user of Xfinity Mobile Service, you can request a copy of this information from Comcast by sending an e-mail to Comcast_Privacy@Comcast.com or a letter to Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, Attn: California Direct Marketing Information, One Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
Please include your name and e-mail address in e-mail requests, and your name and postal address in mail requests.
</p>11.
Change of Ownership or Other Business Transition<p>If Comcast enters into a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or the sale of all or part of its assets (a "Business Transition"), Customer Information will likely be part of the assets transferred before and/or after the transaction closes.</p>
<p>In this event, we will notify you of any Business Transition.
We will also notify you of any subsequent material changes to this Privacy Policy as a result of a Business Transition and give you the opportunity to opt out of material changes with respect to the collection and use of Customer Information.</p>12.
Changes to this Privacy Policy<p>Comcast reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When we do change it, we will make a copy of the updated Privacy Policy available to you by posting it on my.xfinity.com/mobile and on Xfinity Mobile My Account.
</p>
<p>If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, then we will provide you at least 30 days notice and will also notify you by e-mail, direct mail, or other reasonable methods that we select.
You understand and agree that, if you use Xfinity Mobile Service after the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy, Comcast will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>If we make material changes that will result in a new use, disclosure, or permission of access to Customer Information previously collected, we will obtain your opt in consent before implementing such change as required by applicable law.</p>13.
