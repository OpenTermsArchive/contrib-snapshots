Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business requesting verification of information and warning of some consequence if it is not provided.
The email usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate or has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN.
Pretexting is a practice in which someone assumes the guise of another person in order to establish trust and extract private information, typically over the phone or through online communication.
The scammer not only pretends to be someone they're not, but also creates a credible "pretext" for why such information is needed.
