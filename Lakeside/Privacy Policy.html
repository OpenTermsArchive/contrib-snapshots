<b>Disclosure Statement Pursuant to California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010<br>
</b>
<br>The Lakeside Collection and those in our supply chain do not employ slaves or trafficked persons, and we take steps to ensure that this expectation is met by The Lakeside Collection and our direct contractors.
Lakeside includes in its contracts with suppliers a requirement that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is followed.
This act specifically states that goods manufactured in whole or in part of prison labor, and/or forced labor, and/or indentured labor is prohibited.
Our suppliers are subject to regular audits and are contractually obligated to agree to these terms.
Failure to do so is considered a breach of contract.
Additionally, we maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees to ensure compliance.</p>

<br>
<br>
<b>What are the dates of the fundraising program?</b>
<br>The program will run from September 3rd through December 31st, 2012.
<br>
<br>
<b>How are orders placed?</b>
<br>Orders are placed through a special url we create for your school.
This link identifies those purchases as ones on which your school earns a percentage.
If your audience does not have access to the internet, orders can be placed by calling 1-847-444-3150 between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 pm Monday - Friday CST and 8:00 am - 5:00 pm CST on Saturday.
Those ordering by phone will need to indicate they are calling for your school fundraiser.
<br>
<br>
<b>How do I pay for my order?</b>
<br>Orders are paid using a credit card at the time the order is placed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Where will the orders be shipped?</b>
<br>Orders will be shipped to the address given at the time of the order.
They do not have to go to the school.
<br>
<br>
<b>How much does the school earn?</b>
<br>From September 3rd through December 31st, 2012 the school will earn 5% of the sales up to $1,000.00 in purchases.
The school will earn 7% on all sales once purchases are over $1,000.00 including the first $1,000.
There is no minimum or maximum order.
Returns, cancellations by you or us and any type of credit adjustments are not eligible.
<br>
<br>
<b>What if parents wants their sales attributed to more than one school?</b>

Therefore, if you link in to us through more than one school, we will only distribute funds to the first school that was linked.

<li>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Phishing</b> is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information.
Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business requesting verification of information and warning of some consequence if it is not provided.
The email usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate or has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN.
</li>
<li>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Pretexting</b> is a practice in which someone assumes the guise of another person in order to establish trust and extract private information, typically over the phone or through online communication.
The scammer not only pretends to be someone they're not, but also creates a credible "pretext" for why such information is needed.

<br>Back To Questions Question: Can you tell me whether or not an item is in stock? <br> Answer: <p>The status of all of our items are available when you order through our Website and on our Catalog Quick Order.
The stock status will be shown next to the item number of each product.
 And while most of our items are in stock, in cases where products have extremely high demand, we may be awaiting additional stock to fulfill customer orders.
In these cases, we strive to provide an accurate date range within which we expect to receive our stock from our manufacturer.</p>
<p>By placing your order now, we'll put you on our priority list to receive your selection shortly after stock arrives to our warehouse.
Be assured that your credit card will not be charged until we ship your item.</p>
<br>Back To Questions Question: I do not find the stock availability information I need on your website.

Therefore, it is recommended you place your order quickly while our supplies last to ensure receipt of your selection.</p>
<br>Back To Questions Question: My backordered item says you are "awaiting shipment detail." What does this mean? <br> Answer: <p>If an item on backorder says we are "awaiting shipment detail", this means our estimated stock arrival date has passed, and we are validating that our shipment has arrived and we have received all ordered pieces.
In the unlikely case our stock has not arrived, we are awaiting updated information from our vendor.
Please check back in a couple of days for updated status.</p>
