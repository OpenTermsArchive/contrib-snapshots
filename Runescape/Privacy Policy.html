 Privacy Policy
<p>Version 0.5</p>
<p>Date December 24, 2019.</p>
Introduction
<p>Jagex respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.
This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you play our games, visit our website (regardless of where you visit it from) or otherwise access any of our products and services and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

The GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.</p>

The data we collect about you
<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified.
It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

<p>We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.

<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device.
This software may record information such as how often you play our games, the events that occur within the games, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the games were downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the games.</p>
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA
<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services).
In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

MARKETING
<p>We provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>
PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or registered to play our games or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion.</p>
THIRD-PARTY MARKETING
<p>We will get your explicit opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside Jagex for marketing purposes.</p>
OPTING OUT
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
OPTING OUT OF ADVERTISING ID
<p>The Identifier For Advertising (IDFA) is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by the mobile device’s operating system.
We may use this ID to enhance serving and targeting capabilities, re-target specific campaigns, pass the ID to our partners.
Advertising ID does not reveal any information about the user or the device.
If you prefer to opt-out or reset your Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), please follow these standard instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS - Opt out of interest-based ads in the App Store and Apple News (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074).</li>
<li>Android - Opt out of seeing personalized ads (https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en).</li>
</ul>OPTING OUT OF THIRD-PARTY TAILORED ADVERTISING
<p>If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in our games on your mobile device, you may opt- out by:</p>
<ul>
<li>adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device</li>
<li>resetting your Identifier For Advertising (IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioural data tied to the previous Identifier For Advertising (IDFA).</li>
<li>visiting the following link: https://www.appsflyer.com/optout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within our games even if you opt out of tailored advertising, but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.</p>
OPTING OUT OF GEOLOCATION
<p>If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's settings for the games or the “settings” page for the games.</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTING OUT OF OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>When you install our games on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages our games send you on your mobile device even when the game is not on.
You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.</p>
COOKIES

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
CHANGE OF PURPOSE
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
5.
Disclosure of your personal data
<p>We may have to share your personal data with third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific marketing partners listed here.</li>
<li>We may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.
If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
6.
International transfers
<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>7.
Data security
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
8.
Data retention
<p>
<strong>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong>
</p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years plus current year after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <em>Request erasure</em> below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
9.
Your legal rights
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
We set out below a brief description of such rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Request access to your personal data</strong>
<strong>(commonly known as a “data subject access request”):</strong> This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Request correction of your personal data</strong>: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong>: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
<li>
<strong>Object to processing</strong>
<strong>of your personal data:</strong> Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms</li>
<li>
<strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data</strong>: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
or (b) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it</li>
<li>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong>
<strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party:</strong> We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>
<strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data:</strong> However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please Contact us.</p>
NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, in which case we will inform you of an extension period of up to 2 months.
In this case, we will keep you informed on progress.</p>
