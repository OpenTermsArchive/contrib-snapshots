You will continue to receive this information from us even if you choose not to receive direct marketing information from us.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Disclosure of your personal information</h2>

	<p>The Company will not disclose any of its clients’ confidential information to a third party, except: (a) to the extent that it is required to do so pursuant to any applicable laws, rules or regulations; (b) if there is a duty to disclose; (c) if our legitimate business interests require disclosure; (d) in line with our Terms of Service; (e) at your request or with your consent or to those described in this Privacy Notice. The Company will endeavour to make such disclosures on a “need-to-know” basis, unless otherwise instructed by a regulatory authority. Under such circumstances, the Company will notify the third party regarding the confidential nature of any such information.</p>

	<p>As part of using your personal information for the purposes set out above, the Company may disclose your personal information to the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Any members of the Company, which means that any of our affiliates and subsidiaries may receive such information;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Any of our service providers and business partners, for business purposes, such as specialist advisors who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, legal, tax, compliance, insurance, IT, debt-recovery, analytics, research or other services;</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the Company discloses your personal information to service providers and business partners, in order to perform the services requested by clients, such providers and partners may store your personal information within their own systems in order to comply with their legal and other obligations.</p>

	<p>We require that service providers and business partners who process personal information to acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any client’s right to privacy and comply with all relevant privacy and data protection laws and this Privacy Notice.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>

	<p>Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers and business partners store and process your personal data in the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and elsewhere in the world.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)</h2>

	<p>We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA and UK to other Company subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (i.e Data Processors) who are engaged on our behalf. To the extent that we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA and UK, we will ensure that the transfer is lawful and that Data Processors in third countries are obliged to comply with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Act 2016 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. If transfers of personal information are processed in the US, we may in some cases rely on standard contractual clauses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Transfers of Personal Information outside of your country</h2>

	<p>By using our products and services, you consent to your Personal Data being transferred to other countries, including countries that have differing levels of privacy and data protection laws than your country. In all such transfers, we will protect your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice, and ensure that appropriate information sharing contractual agreements are in place.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains</h2>

	<p>Your funding of bitcoin, XRP, ether, and other Digital Assets, may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.</p>

	<p>Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Payward or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data from such networks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Data Retention</h2>

	<p>Safeguarding the privacy of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by email, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We will hold personal information, for as long as we have a business relationship with you, in secure computer storage facilities, and we take the necessary measures to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>

	<p>When we consider that personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time (after you cease being our client). For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain the following, for a period of 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Also, the personal information we hold in the form of a recorded information, by telephone, electronically or otherwise, will be held in line with local regulatory requirements (i.e. 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended or longer if you have legitimate interests (such as handling a dispute with you)). If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.</p>

	<p>We may keep your data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory, or technical reasons.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>When you use our products and services, we may make use of the standard practice of placing tiny data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking tools (herein, “Cookies”) on your computer or other devices used when engaging with us. We use Cookies to (i) help us recognize you as a customer, collect information about your use of our products and services, to better customize our services and content for you, and to collect information about your computer or other access devices to ensure our compliance with our BSA and AML obligations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

If we have disclosed your personal information to others, we will let them know about the rectification where possible.

	<p><strong>Data portability </strong></p>

	<p>In certain circumstances you might have the right, to obtain personal information you have provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to re-use it elsewhere or ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.</p>

	<p><strong>Objection</strong></p>

	<p>You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal information except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Processing your personal information for direct marketing; or</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Processing your personal information for research unless we reasonably believe such processing is necessary or prudent for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (such as by a regulatory or enforcement agency).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Automated decision-making and profiling </strong></p>

	<p>If we have made a decision about you based solely on an automated process (e.g. through automatic profiling) that affects your ability to access our products and services or has another significant effect on you, you can request not to be subject to such a decision unless we can demonstrate to you that such decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us. Even if a decision is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, you may contest the decision and require human intervention. We may not be able to offer our products or services to you, if we agree to such a request (i.e. end our relationship with you).</p>
