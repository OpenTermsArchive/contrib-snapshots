 Your California Privacy Disclosures Do Not Track<p>Apple does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
If you are visiting such sites, Safari allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
If you would like to learn how to set Safari so that websites do not track you, go here:  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21416. </p>
<p>Third parties that have content embedded on Apple’s websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Apple website from a certain IP address.
Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.<br>  </p>Notice for Minors<p>Apple offers interactive services which allow you to post content to share publicly or with friends.
 At any time you can delete or remove content you have posted using the deletion or removal options within our services.
 If you have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if you would like additional assistance with deletion you can contact our Apple Support team directly here.
 Although we offer deletion capability for our services, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the services.</p>
