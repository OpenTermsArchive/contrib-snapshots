</p>
<p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or similar technology that are not associated with or over which the Conservancy has no control.

We are not responsible for the information practices or content of these other websites and/or applications.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps or our Social Media Pages.</p>
