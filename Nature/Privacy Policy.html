<p>The Nature Conservancy and its subsidiaries, branches, vendors, service providers, or affiliates (the “Conservancy”) take your privacy very seriously and cares about how your information is collected, used, stored, and shared.
To better protect your privacy, we are providing this Privacy Statement to explain our practices and the choices that you can make about the way your information is used by the Conservancy.
The information below explains our policy regarding your privacy, both online and offline, in the United States.</p>
<p>By accessing a Platform (defined below) owned and/or operated by the Conservancy and/or providing your Personal Information with the Conservancy, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement and the Conservancy may use the information provided in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
If you reside outside the United States, you understand and agree that your Personal Information may be processed in the United States where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may differ from the laws in your country.</p>
<p>
<b>How We Collect Information:</b>
</p>
<p>The Conservancy and its service providers may collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and similar contact information and payment or credit card information (“Personal Information”).
If you choose to provide your payment or credit card information to the Conservancy, we will use that information for the purposes for which it was provided.
We may combine the Personal Information we collect with Other Information.
