What This Privacy Policy Covers
Top <ul>
<li>This Privacy Policy covers how Legacy.com, Inc.
(collectively, "Legacy.com", "we", "us", or "our") treats user or personally identifiable information that the Services collect and receive.
If, however, you are accessing this Privacy Policy from a website operated in conjunction with one of our affiliates ("Affiliates"), the privacy policy of the Affiliate will govern unless such policy states otherwise.</li>
<li>Subject to the above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Legacy.com, Inc.
does not own, operate or control, or to people that it does not employ or manage.</li>
</ul> 2.
General
Top <p>In general, you can browse the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself to us.
Legacy.com, Inc.
does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals on interactive areas of the Services.
"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person, such as name, postal address, email address, phone number, and credit card number, among other information, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
Any posting made while using the Services, and any other information that can be viewed by the public and therefore is not considered "personal information" or "Personally Identifiable Information" is not the type of information covered by this Privacy Policy.</p> 3.

We may collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register to receive alerts or offerings, sponsor, access or submit information in connection with certain Services, post other content through the Services, purchase products or other services, opt-in to receive special offers and discounts from us and our selected partners or participate in other activities offered or administered by Legacy.com.</li>

Our server logs automatically receive and record information from your browser (including, for example, your IP address, and the page(s) you visit).

</ul>
</li>
<li>Use of Anonymous Information: <ul>
<li>Certain information that we collect automatically or with electronic tools (such as cookies) is used to anonymously track and measure user traffic for the Services and to enhance your experience with the Services.
For example: <ul>
<li>IP Addresses/Session Information.
We occasionally may obtain IP addresses from users depending upon how you access the Services.
IP addresses, browser, and session information may be used for various purposes, including to help administer the Services and diagnose and prevent service or other technology problems related to the Services.
This information also may be used to estimate the total number of users downloading any App and browsing other Services from specific geographical areas, to help determine which users have access privileges to certain content or services that we offer, and to monitor and prevent fraud and abuse.
IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information</li>
<li>Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive or comparable storage media on your mobile device.
You can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject them, or notify you when a cookie is set.
If you reject cookies, you may not be able to use our Services that require you to sign in, or to take full advantage of all our offerings.
Cookies may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party we authorize to collect information on our behalf.
We use our own cookies to transmit information for a number of purposes, including to: <ul>
<li>require you to re-enter your password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accessing your account contents;</li>
<li>keep track of preferences you specify while you are using the Services;</li>
<li>estimate and report our total audience size and traffic;</li>

with our partners, advertisers and others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> 5.
Privacy Alert: Your Postings Generally Are Accessible to the Public
Top <ul>
<li>Your own use of the Services may disclose personal information or Personally Identifiable Information to the public.
For example: <ul>
<li>Submissions and other postings to our Services are available for viewing by all our visitors unless the sponsor or host of a Service selects a privacy setting that restricts public access.
Please remember that any information disclosed on a non-restricted Service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without our knowledge.
You therefore should exercise caution when disclosing any personal information or Personally Identifiable Information in these forums.</li>
<li>When you post a message to any message board, blog, or other public forum available through the Services, your user ID or alias that you are posting under may be visible to other users, and you have the ability to post a message that may include personal information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you post Personally Identifiable Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Such activities are beyond the control of Legacy.com, Inc.
and the coverage of this Privacy Policy.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
In addition, although we employ technology and software designed to minimize spam sent to users and unsolicited, automatic posts to message boards, blogs, or other public forums available through the Services (like the CAPTCHA word verification you see on email and registration forms), we cannot ensure such measures to be 100% reliable or satisfactory.</li>
</ul> 6.
Children’s Privacy
Top <ul>
<li>Legacy.com, Inc.
does not intentionally collect from or maintain Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13, nor do we offer any content targeted to such children.</li>
<li>In the event that Legacy.com, Inc.
becomes aware that a user of the Services is under the age of 13, the following additional privacy terms and notices apply: <ul>
<li>Prior to collecting any Personally Identifiable Information about a child that Legacy.com, Inc.
has become aware is under the age of 13, Legacy.com, Inc.
will make reasonable efforts to contact the child’s parent, to inform the parent about the types of information Legacy.com, Inc.
will collect, how it will be used, and under what circumstances it will be disclosed, and to obtain consent from the child’s parent to collection and use of such information.</li>
<li>Although Legacy.com, Inc.
will apply these children’s privacy terms whenever it becomes aware that a user who submits Personally Identifiable Information is less than 13 years old, no method is foolproof.
Legacy.com, Inc.
strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment.
These tools also can prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</li>
<li>Personally Identifiable Information collected from children may include any of the information defined above as Personally Identifiable Information with respect to general users of the Services and may be used by Legacy.com, Inc.
for the same purposes.
Except as necessary to process a child’s requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured through the Services, Legacy.com, Inc.
does not rent, sell, barter or give away any lists containing a child’s Personally Identifiable Information for use by any outside company.</li>
<li>A child’s parent or legal guardian may request Legacy.com, Inc.
to provide a description of the Personally Identifiable Information that Legacy.com, Inc.
has collected from the child, as well as instruct Legacy.com, Inc.
to cease further use, maintenance and collection of Personally Identifiable Information from the child.
</li>
<li>If a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, email address or other personally-identifying information on chat areas, bulletin boards or other forums or public posting areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> 7.
