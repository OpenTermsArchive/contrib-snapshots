<li>
<p>RELEASE OF CLAIMS</p>
<p>You hereby release POPSUGAR, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of (i) having acquired or not acquired any Content through the Services, or (ii) any disputes with any third party and our Services.
IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU SHALL AND HEREBY DO WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION</p>
<p>POPSUGAR reserves the right to modify, discontinue, terminate or suspend any and all Services without prior notice.
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use any part of the Services.
You may terminate your use of the Services or your membership at any time by following the instructions on the Services.
POPSUGAR may terminate or suspend your access to the Services (and/or any feature thereof) or your membership at any time, for any reason, and without warning, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.
Upon termination of your account, your right to access and use the Services and any Content will immediately cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BINDING ARBITRATION</p>
<p>Certain portions of this Arbitration section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and POPSUGAR agree that we intend that this section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You and POPSUGAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to use or purchase of the Services or any aspect of the relationship between You and POPSUGAR.
This includes agreeing to arbitrate claims that arose before this Agreement came into effect and any claims that may arise after termination of this Agreement.
The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect.
Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.
(II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES.
AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.
If the specific provision of this paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Agreement titled “BINDING ARBITRATION” shall be null and void.</p>
<p>Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.
YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT.
THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
POPSUGAR shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond POPSUGAR’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference).
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
Subject to the arbitration provision and for all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>You and POPSUGAR agree that this Agreement (including any terms or policies expressly incorporated herein) is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO AGENCY.
NO ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with POPSUGAR’s prior written consent.
POPSUGAR may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent.
Headings for each section have been included for your convenience, but such headings do not have any legal meaning, and may not accurately reflect the content of the provisions they precede.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind POPSUGAR in any respect whatsoever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SURVIVAL</p>
<p>All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive performance hereof by you or POPSUGAR, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability, shall survive the completion of the performance, cancellation or termination of this Agreement.</p>
