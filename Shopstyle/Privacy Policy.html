This Privacy Policy applies to your use of our websites, mobile websites, mobile applications and any related services which you can find out about more in our Terms of Service at http://www.popsugar.com/tos (“Service(s)”).

<p>WHAT INFORMATION DOES POPSUGAR COLLECT?</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of “personally identifiable” information (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” information (meaning it cannot be used to specifically identify you) that we may collect in your use of our Services.
We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any other company or individual that we do not own or control.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>HOW DOES POPSUGAR USE COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS?</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile web browser that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and transfer information about you and your use of our Services.
For example, cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our websites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you.
We use “persistent” cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Services.
We also use “session ID” cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Services.
Unlike persistent cookies, session ID cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a Service and close your browser.
</p>
<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner, may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag (“Web Beacons”) to you through our Services from an ad network.
Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service interface or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service interface, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon.
Web Beacons allow ad networks and service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners.
Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and Web Beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOW DOES POPSUGAR USE SOCIAL PLUGINS?</p>
<p>We may use social plugins on our Services, for instance plugins of the social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and Tumblr, and may feature icons, like the “thumbs up” icon or text like "Recommend“, "Like“ or "Comment“.
These cookies are activated once you start navigating our website.
Your browser may create a connection to the servers of such social networks and/or transmit data to such servers when you view a page on our website.
If you use the plugin functionality (e.g.
click the “Like” button or make a comment), this information is also transmitted directly to the social network by your browser and may be stored there.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of these third party social networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOW DOES POPSUGAR USE THIRD-PARTY ONLINE ADVERTISING OR ANALYTICS?</p>
<p>Some of the advertisements you see on our Services or on emails we deliver to you are delivered by advertisers who collect information about your online activities with the emails we send and/or on our Services through the use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and other technologies.
