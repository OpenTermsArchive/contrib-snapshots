 Online Practices <p>
<b>Chase is</b> committed to your privacy and security online.
We want to satisfy you and provide a superior online experience while respecting your privacy.</p> Visiting Our Website <p>You can browse our site anonymously without identifying yourself during your visit.
We will obtain information that personally identifies you when you specifically choose to provide it.</p>
<p>For example, during your visits to our web sites, you may request information, contact us, apply for Chase products or services or conduct transactions online.
You will then need to give us certain personal information just as you would if you were communicating with us in person, by mail or by telephone.
Be assured that we maintain electronic security safeguards to help protect personal information about you that we obtain via the Internet.</p>
<p>By providing information about yourself and your preferences, you can enhance your online experience with us.
And, we will be able to better service your requests and/or inquiries.</p> How We Collect Information Online <p>When you visit our site we may ask you to "sign in," complete a survey, or answer simple questions.
These may include questions such as where you live, your email address and your interest in receiving email from Chase on new products and services.
We collect this information so that we can determine what kinds of products and services are of most interest to you.</p> Online Tracking <p>We may track activity and transactions on an individually identifiable basis if you apply for or use a Chase product or service online.
We may use identification information we collect in order to protect against actual or potential fraud.
In order to constantly improve our web site and better serve our customers online, Chase may use various tracking methods (such as cookies and other technologies, etc.) to gather information about site visitors' browsing activities.</p> Cookies <p>"Cookies" are small amounts of data that a web site can send to a web browser on a visitor's computer.
The cookie is stored on a visitor's computer.
A cookie may enable the site holder to track how a visitor navigates through its site and the areas in which they show interest.
This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals.
A cookie may also be used to authentic the user and the machine accessing the site.
Information gathered from using cookies may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, the site visited just before and just after the Chase site, or general information about the machine used to access the site.</p>
<p>
<b>Types of Cookies</b>
<br>
Â <br>
Cookies can be set to expire:</p>
<ul>
<li>on a specified date</li>
<li>after a specific period of time</li>
<li>when a transaction has been completed</li>
<li>or when a user turns off his/her browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor's browser closes is called a "session" cookie.
Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called "persistent" cookies.<br>
</p>
<p>Persistent cookies may be used in some cases, for example, to authenticate or otherwise recognize when a visitor returns to a web site.
The web browser will send the cookie information from the initial visit back to the web site.
This is useful to the visitor if he or she has established a password at a particular web site and wants to be identified by that site to perform a function or transaction.<br>
</p>
<p>To browse anonymously, you may set your browser to disable cookies or delete cookies.
See Refusing Cookies below.
Please note that disabling cookies for some services will impact ability to use that service.</p> Refusing Cookies on Chase Websites <p>Customers may choose not to accept cookies.
Your web browser may alert and permit you to refuse cookies.
When you receive an alert, you may choose at that time to refuse that cookie.
If the use of cookies is a concern to you, then please make sure your browser has this capability, and that you set your browser to alert you accordingly.
Newer browser versions allow you to be alerted or to automatically refuse cookies.
You may need to download a more current version of your web browser from your service provider in order to obtain this option.</p>

</p> Online Advertising <p>Chase uses cookies to evaluate our web site and to track advertising leads and campaigns from banner Ads, opt in emails and through third party ad services.
Chase may hire companies such as third party ad services to track and report performance of advertising and marketing campaigns to and from Chase and third party web sites.
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you.
These ad service providers may use behavioral information such as how you navigate the web sites to provide relevant advertisements to you.
We permit certain companies to set cookies and use related technology, such as tracking pixels.</p>
<p>These tracking pixels (also known as action tags, web beacons, or transparent GIF files) and other similar tracking technologies may be used to collect and store information about user visits, such as the user's anonymous cookie ID, page visits and duration, and the specific ad or link(s) that the user clicked on to visit the site.
No personally identifiable information is stored on these cookies or web pixels.
This user activity information is reported to us in aggregate and is anonymous.
We use this information in aggregate to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>
</p> Email Communications <p>If you choose to send us an email message, we may retain the content of the email, your email address, and our response in order to service your needs.</p>
<p>Whenever you provide to us or we otherwise obtain your email address, we may use that email address to send you messages related to your accounts or services or other products or services that may be available to you.
You can unsubscribe from some of these email messages by following the instructions provided in the email message.
See Email Opt Out below for more details.</p>
<p>Please note that some Chase services or online programs such as Chase Online, Chase Credit Card Alerts and the Chase Bill Management Center require a valid email address in order to register and/or continue use of the service.
You will receive email alerts or notification messages from these programs unless you un-enroll from these services.
To learn more about these services and how to update your preferences, log onto your Chase Online account.</p> Email Opt Out <p>If you no longer wish to receive email offers or solicitations from Chase, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions in the original email you received.
The instructions are generally located at the bottom of the email.
If you receive emails from third parties or program partners on behalf of Chase, please be sure to unsubscribe through the instructions in the email or contact these third parties directly.</p>
<p>If you opt out of email solicitations, Chase reserves the right to contact you via email to service and maintain your account relationship.
For example, we may notify you about fraudulent activity on your account, respond to any customer inquiries or requests, or alert you to web site changes or outages.</p> Email Tips <p>Do not provide your email address to third party web sites without reading the privacy and security policies and terms and conditions of these sites to ensure you understand the circumstances in which your email address will be used.</p>
<p>If you suspect suspicious or fraudulent activity related to your account(s), please let your account provider know right away.
You should also contact your Internet Service Provider so they may block suspicious messages from your email inbox.
To learn more about how to control and manage your incoming emails, please refer to your Internet Service Providers' online resources.
You may also visit the Federal Trade Commission's web site on spam at http://www.ftc.gov/spam.</p> Weblinking Practices (Links to Third Party Sites) <p>Chase may provide access to information, products or services offered on websites that are owned or operated by other companies ("third party websites").
We provide this access through the use of hyperlinks that automatically move you from a Chase website to the third party site.</p>
<p>While we do our best to provide you with helpful, trustworthy resources, Chase cannot endorse, approve or guarantee information, products, services or recommendations provided at a third party website.
Because we may not always know when information on a linked site changes, Chase is not responsible for the content or accuracy of any third party website.
Chase shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort resulting from the use of a link on its websites nor will it be liable for any failure of products or services advertised or provided on these linked sites.</p>
<p>Chase offers you links on an "as is" basis.
When you visit a third party website by using a link on a Chase site, you will no longer be protected by the Chase privacy policy or security practices.
The data collection, use and protection practices of the linked site may differ from the practices of Chase sites.
You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and security practices of the linked website.
Those are the policies and practices that will apply to your use of the linked website, NOT the Chase policies and practices.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you tell if you have left a Chase website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of a Chase address, the URL of the linked website appears in the location box (or address field) of your web browser.</li>
<li>The linked website is shown in a new browser window.
The appearance of the linked site, including its colors and graphic design, is significantly different from the Chase site.</li>
<li>The linked site or page does not appear in a new browser, but you find one or more of the following:<ol>
<li>The phrase "A Chase linked site" beneath the Chase logo.</li>
<li>The logo of a different company appears in a prominent location on the linked website, along with the words "Powered by," "Brought to you by," or "Provided by."</li>
<li>The layout and content of the navigation tools on the left-hand side of the linked site or in the header at the top of the new website are different from Chase navigation.</li>
<li>One of the navigation links refers to a description of the company that sponsors the website.
It may be titled "About (Third Party's Name).</li>
<li>A third party's privacy policy and terms of use statement are identified instead of Chase's.</li>
<li>Information in the footer at the bottom of the website contains information about a company other than Chase.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul> Social Security Number Policy <p>Chase, in the normal course of business and as required by law, collects Social Security numbers in establishing, maintaining and servicing customer accounts.
It is Chase's policy to implement reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers, to prohibit unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers, and to limit access to Social Security numbers.</p> Children's Online Privacy <p>Protecting children on the Internet is very important to us.
For that reason, Chase does not intentionally collect information at our web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is intended to attract anyone under 13.
Parents can be proactive and limit web site access to their children by installing filtering software.</p>
<p>Children's access to the Internet can permit them to visit inappropriate web sites and be exposed to unnecessary risks.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 13 from the online collection of personal information.
Learn more about COPPA at the Federal Trade Commission's web site for children's privacy by reading How to Protect Kids' Privacy Online.</p>
