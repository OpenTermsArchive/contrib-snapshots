<p>We may also disclose your Personal Data to a third party following, or in the course of, a restructuring, merger or acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets of Nissan or any other similar transaction or operation, as well as in case of insolvency, bankruptcy, or sequestration of assets during which Personal Data are transferred to third parties as Nissan�s assets. <br><br>

In the event of legal proceedings, we may share information related to you that could be of assistance to us to defend our rights or resolve legal conflicts. <br><br>
Finally, we share generalized statistics or Personal Data in an aggregated form for certain purposes, such as analyzing your use of our Site or services, your areas of interest and behavior.

<h3>6. How Does Nissan Protect Your Personal Data?</h3>
<p>Nissan has implemented reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to maintain a level of information security well adapted to the level of risk related to the processing of your Personal Data. These measures aim, in particular, to protect your Personal Data against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, both accidental and intentional. 
<br><br>However, no method of transmission of data on the internet and no method of storage (in either an electronic or a physical environment) can be entirely secure. We endeavor to protect your Personal Data to the best of our abilities, but we cannot guarantee an absolute security or integrity during the transmission of your data from your system to ours. Any transmission is at your own risk. 

</p>

<h3>7. Are There Any International Transfers of Your Personal Data?</h3>
<p>The storing and processing of your Personal Data as outlined above will sometimes require that we transfer and/or store your Personal Data outside of your country or region of residence. Legislation regarding the protection of personal data of such third countries may differ from those of your country or region of residence, in particular regarding the internal management of services and commercial or marketing communications. <br><br>
Where the Act on the Protection of Personal Information of Japan (the �<b>Act</b>�) applies and we transfer your Personal Data outside of Japan, we will take all necessary measures through contracts based on the Act and any applicable guidelines. Where GDPR applies and the country of destination is outside of the EU and does not provide a level of protection of personal data equivalent to that of the EU, we will take all necessary measures, either through an Adequacy Decision by the European Commission or, in the absence of such a decision, through appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses.


</p>


<h3>8. How Long Do We Store Your Personal Data?</h3>
<p>Nissan stores your Personal Data for a period that is reasonable and/or as required by law. The storage period will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and used your Personal Data, and as required by any relevant legislations.  <br><br>
In order to determine the retention period, we consider factors such as: </p>

<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li style="list-style: disc;">Your use of our Site and services; </li>
    <li style="list-style: disc;">The existence of contractual or legal obligations requiring us to retain your Personal Data for a fixed period;</li>
    <li style="list-style: disc;">The existence of any legal proceedings related to your use of our Site or services.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a rule of thumb, we only store your Personal Data in active files or systems for the duration necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which we collected them, in compliance with applicable legislation. For example:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li style="list-style: disc;">In general, we will retain all your Personal Data until the deletion of your user account, if applicable;</li>
    <li style="list-style: disc;">Exceptionally, and unless provided otherwise by local Privacy and Data Protection Laws, we may store your email address and your name and last name for the purpose of electronic marketing activities for no longer than 3 years starting from our last communication with you. You may at any moment exercise your right to object to the processing of your Personal Data for this purpose.</li>
    
</ul>

<p>

If you object to the processing of your Personal Data for electronic marketing purposes, we will retain your Personal Data for the duration necessary to comply with, and prove our compliance with, your request, and will delete your Personal Data unless they are necessary for the accomplishment of another purpose, such as the use of our Site or services. <br><br>
For any other type of processing aside from electronic marketing, we retain your Personal Data for the entire duration of our commercial relationship and, at its termination, we keep your Personal Data for the maximum duration authorized by law for tax and accounting purposes. We may also archive your Personal Data for the duration of any legal obligations, after which we will periodically delete them unless further processing is necessary for other purposes mentioned above. <br><br>
Below is a table indicating how long we keep your data according to specific purposes:
