<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p> This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable to our websites and to all games and other activities that are offered by us on or through our websites.
(Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Websites.")

Players can access our Websites to play games without registering.

Also, visitors to the Websites will be able to rate games and browse for the newly added, top-rated, and most-popular games.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.  </strong>
<strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p> The information that our Websites collect includes (among others) the following:

<p> 2.1    When you visit our Websites, our servers automatically save your computer's IP address.
IP addresses will be collected, along with information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Websites.
If you arrive at the Websites via a link from another website, the URL of the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.
</p>
<p> 2.2    In addition, we store certain information from your browser, using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer and is tied to information about the user.
SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience on the Websites, including the following:

Whenever you buy something from the Websites (e.g., a virtual game item or a subscription for a game download), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours.

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>2.6    Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
You can opt out of receiving cookies from certain third-party advertising networks by resetting your browser.
