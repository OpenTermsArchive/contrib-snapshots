Information We Observe or Collect through Technology</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.
Navigational and Location Information</b>
</p>
<p>When you visit this Web site or an online channel where this policy is linked, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate.
Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you.
However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.
When collecting the IP address, we may also be able to determine location information such as city, state, country, a designated marketing area and the ISP being used.
We will also collect the type of mobile device you are using when connecting to our mobile website so we can provide the mobile website version best suited for your device.</p>
<p>
<b>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.
Cookies and Clear gifs </b>
</p>
<p>To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie.
A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer or device.
It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, and remember you and your online purchases when you return.
This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes, location and/or purchase history.
</p>
<p>We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Web site, mobile site, microsites, and BBW social media pages and in our emails.
A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message.
It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed.
Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.
and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.
</p>
<p>Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most: for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites.
and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site.
</p>
<p>Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide or we otherwise collect (such as name, address, phone number, email address, and IP address).
We'll associate this information only for our purposes: to deliver products and services to you.
to improve our business.
to transact business.
and to market our products and services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail.
As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart.
We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences.
The end-result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

<b>HOW MAY YOU INTERACT WITH THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES AND CONTENT?</b>
</p>
<p>We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content.
We do this for your convenience.
We don't endorse, or generally have any affiliation with, these third parties.
And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices.
Whether their content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of those third-party sites govern your online experience (unless we have also linked our privacy policy and/or terms and conditions to some portion of the third-party site).

Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites</b>
</p>
<p>We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys.

In these cases, we will display or link our privacy policy and terms and conditions.
For example, you may find a third-party social media site (e.g., Facebook) where you can interact with us through a frame, e.g., you may virtually enter the frame to buy BBW products.
