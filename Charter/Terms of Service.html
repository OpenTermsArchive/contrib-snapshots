NETWORK MANAGEMENT <p>Charter manages its network to deliver the best possible service to all of our customers.
This is necessary because high-speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited.
Additionally, if we did not manage our network, our customers would be subject to the negative effects of "spam," viruses, security attacks, network congestion, and other risks and degradations of service.
To address these risks, Charter uses reasonable network management practices with the goal of relieving network congestion and ensuring that all customers have the opportunity to use the Service with the best available results.
Charter uses tools that it considers to be the least disruptive to the customer experience.</p>
<p>In the case of significantly high bandwidth usage causing congestion (regardless of the usage type or format), Charter may temporarily reduce the available bandwidth to those customers identified as using such high amounts of bandwidth as necessary to reduce bandwidth congestion.
This may cause high bandwidth users to temporarily experience slower Service speeds, but specific network traffic is not targeted for restriction during these times.
While Charter does not guarantee that the network will never experience disruptions, we believe our network management techniques are among the best available for assuring a good customer experience.
Of course, Charter's network management practices will change and evolve, along with the uses of the Internet and the challenges and threats on the Internet.
</p> 14.
NO EXCESSIVE USE OF BANDWIDTH <p>The Service is for residential use and only within limits that Charter considers reasonable for the service level to which Customer subscribes.
Residential service usage for Customers subscribing to the Lite or Express packages should not exceed 100 Gigabytes ("GB") of data per month.
Usage for Customers subscribing to the Plus or Max packages should not exceed 250 GB of data per month and usage for Customers subscribing to the Ultra100 package should not exceed 500 GB of data per month.
Charter reserves the right to revise or implement additional usage limits at any time.</p>
<p>It is a violation of this Policy to use the Service in excess of these limits.
In these cases, Charter may, in its sole discretion, notify Customer of excessive use and (i) request Customer to employ corrective or self-limiting actions to comply with this provision.
(ii) suspend or terminate Customer's Service account.
or (iii) request that Customer subscribe to a version of the Service (such as a commercial grade Internet service, if appropriate) for use at higher data consumption levels that align with Customer's usage patterns.
Charter's determination of the data consumption for Service accounts is final.
</p> 15.
NO "VIRUSES" <p>Customer will not use, or allow others to use, the Service to transmit computer "viruses," worms, "Trojan horses," denial of service attacks or other harmful software programs or information containing any lock, key, bomb, worm, cancelbot, or other harmful feature.
Customer will use standard practices to prevent the transmission of such viruses, or other harmful software and information.

</ul>Important Information about Charter Telephone 911 Services &amp.
Battery Back-up <p>To help you quickly respond to emergencies, Charter provides emergency 911 services much like traditional telephone companies.
Should you ever need to access emergency services – fire, police, or ambulance – just dial the familiar digits "<strong>9-1-1</strong>," using your <strong>Charter Telephone </strong>Service.
Your call will be routed directly to the nearest public-safety operator, who will dispatch the appropriate services.
With Enhanced 911, emergency services will be able to quickly find you – your telephone number and address are electronically routed to the operator the moment your call goes through.</p>
<p>
<strong>Charter Telephone </strong>provides your home with telephone service using a Multimedia Terminal Adaptor (MTA), or a telephone modem, that requires electrical power in your home.
As is the case with cordless phones, your <strong>Charter Telephone</strong> equipment will not work in the event of a power outage, and you will not be able to make or receive calls, including 911 calls, unless at the time of ordering service you chose to have a battery-slotted MTA installed and have purchased and installed a battery into the appropriate slot in the MTA.
In a power outage, a cordless telephone, and other equipment connected to the telephone line that requires electricity, such as telecommunications devices used to assist with disabilities, will not work unless they have a battery that allows them to function for a period of time without electricity to your residence.  You are responsible for providing and installing batteries for your cordless telephone and other telecommunications devices and to ensure that they operate during a power outage.
</p>
<p>You are also responsible for the purchase of the MTA backup battery for which you will be assessed a one-time charge at the time of order entry.  If you would like to order an initial backup battery or extra backup batteries, or if you would like to upgrade your MTA to a model that includes a slot for a backup battery, you should contact <strong>Charter Customer Care </strong>at <strong>1-888-438-2427</strong>. </p>
<p>The backup battery is designed only to power your MTA to enable calling, including 911 calling, for up to eight hours of standby time and approximately five hours of talk time, in the event of a power outage.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for monitoring the status of the back-up battery and for ensuring that the battery is charging normally.  Please note the following battery status light conditions after the unit has been connected and powered: </p>
<ul>
<li>If the status light is green and flashing, this denotes that the installed battery is taking a charge.
This is the unit's normal operating mode upon being newly installed.
</li>
<li>A steady green light represents a fully charged battery.
this typically takes a few hours after initial power-up.</li>
<li>Amber light signifies that the battery is discharging or not able to charge.  If the unit displays an amber light, the battery should be replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lithium-ion backup battery  generally provides 6 to 10 years of service life.
 The back-up battery can safely be stored within the following temperature range: °F -4 to 140/(°C -20 to 60).  However it is important to note that storage of back-up batteries above 77°F (25°C) will significantly reduce life of the battery and is not recommended.</p>
<p>Whenever commercial power or its equivalent is required to operate services of facilities provided by the Company at the customer's premises, the customer shall:  furnish such power which shall be suitable for the purpose;  provide and maintain all necessary power wiring and power outlets in a suitable location and in a safe fashion.
and allow the Company access to the power supply, if necessary.
In the event of a power failure, no allowance is made for interruption of service and the Company shall not be held liable for such an interruption of service.  Nor shall the company be liable for any property damage or personal injury, or any other alleged damage or injury, caused by any customer-provided power supply, wiring, or power outlet.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.
This Agreement requires the use of arbitration to resolve disputes and otherwise limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>Subject to the "Exclusions" paragraph below, Charter and you agree to arbitrate those disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to any prior oral or written agreement for services between Charter and you.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action on any matter or subject in small claims court.</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT MEMORIALIZES A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, AND THUS THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of intent to arbitrate, entitled "Notice of Intent to Arbitrate" ("Notice").
The Notice to Charter should be addressed to: General Counsel, Charter Communications, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St.
Louis, MO 63131 ("Arbitration Notice Address").
The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Charter may commence an arbitration proceeding, in which all issues are for the arbitrator to decide (including the scope of the arbitration clause), but the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.</p>
<p>CHARTER SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ANY ARBITRATION FILING FEES.</p>
<p>The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN THE ARBITRATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS FEES OR EXPERT WITNESS COSTS.</p>
<p>If the arbitrator's award exceeds $75,000, either party may appeal such award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA and selected according to the AAA Rules, by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days after the date of entry of the arbitration award.
The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.
The three-arbitrator panel must issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which may exist under the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>If the amount in dispute is less than $15,000, the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of the documents submitted to the arbitrator.
In the event the amount in dispute is more than $15,000, Charter agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND CHARTER ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p>Unless Charter and you agree otherwise in writing, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide the specific relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
The arbitrator must give effect to the limitations on Charter's liability as set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>YOU AND CHARTER AGREE THAT YOU AND CHARTER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Furthermore, unless both you and Charter agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of these arbitration provisions shall be null and void and rendered of no further effect with respect to the specific claim at issue.</p>
<p>Right to Opt Out.
If you do not wish to be bound by these arbitration provisions, you must notify Charter in writing within 30 days of the date that you first subscribe to the underlying service(s) under this Agreement by visiting (www.charter.com/arbitration/optout), or by mail to the Arbitration Notice Address.
Your written notification to Charter must include your name, address, and Charter account number as well as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Charter through arbitration.
Your decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Charter or the delivery of services to you by Charter.</p>
<p>Severability.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT THE ENTIRETY OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC CLAIM AT ISSUE, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p>For purposes of clarification, all claims pertaining to billing errors must be raised/brought within 90 days of the date of the invoice in which such alleged error occurred/arose or such claims shall be waived.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence only, in the event such waiver is found to be unenforceable, it shall be severed from this Agreement, rendered null and void and of no further effect without affecting the rest of the arbitration provisions set forth herein.</p>
<p>EXCLUSIONS.
YOU AND CHARTER AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS OR DISPUTES SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION:</p>
<p>(1) ANY INDIVIDUAL ACTION BROUGHT BY YOU OR BY CHARTER ON ANY MATTER OR SUBJECT THAT IS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A COURT THAT IS LIMITED TO ADJUDICATING SMALL CLAIMS.</p>
<p>(2) ANY DISPUTE OVER THE VALIDITY OF ANY PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

</ul>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES <p>Charter's Acceptable Use Policy (the "AUP") and the practices outlined herein, describe how Charter monitors the overall traffic on its network as key segments approach peak utilization levels (described below).
When congestion occurs Charter will temporarily manage usage activity to maintain quality of service for all customers and to enable all users to access a "fair share" of the network capacity.  Charter does not target specific protocols.  Charter's experience is that under these management techniques, incidents of noticeable congestion have been rare under normal operating conditions.</p>
<p>
<u>Technical detail </u>
</p>
<p>Charter's network software continuously examines aggregate traffic usage data for individual segments of the network.
</p>
<p>Each cable modem on Charter's network is connected to the CMTS through the ports on the CMTS.
These ports can be either "downstream" ports or "upstream" ports (the term "port" also applies to virtual channels, also known as "bonded groups," in a DOCSIS 3.0 environment).  If overall usage of a CMTS upstream or downstream port reaches a near congestion threshold for a defined period of time, then Charter's software examines bandwidth usage data for subscribers in the affected network segment to determine which subscribers are using a disproportionate share of the bandwidth.
If the software determines that one or subscribers have been the source of high volumes of network traffic over a particular time interval, traffic originating from those subscribers will be assigned a lower priority status temporarily.  If the affected network segment does not actually become congested, traffic assigned a lower priority status will not be delayed.  If such network segment becomes congested, lower priority traffic could be delayed compared to higher priority traffic.  The corresponding subscriber's traffic returns to normal priority status once his or her bandwidth usage drops below a set threshold over a particular time interval.</p>
<p>Charter currently uses the following settings for congestion management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upstream Port Utilization Threshold: average of 70% of the total aggregate bandwidth for the port</li>
<li>Downstream Port Utilization Threshold: average of 70% of the total aggregate bandwidth for the port</li>
<li>Port Utilization Duration: approximately 15 minutes</li>
<li>Subscriber Consumption Threshold: average of 70% or more of provisioned upstream or downstream bandwidth (Because provisioned bandwidth varies by account, users of higher speed tiers will have correspondingly higher User Consumption Thresholds)</li>
<li>Subscriber Consumption Duration: approximately 15 minutes</li>
<li>Release Criteria: consumption &lt.
50% of provisioned upstream or downstream bandwidth for approximately 15 minutes.  These release criteria are intended to minimize user Quality of Service oscillation, that is, a situation in which a particular user could cycle repeatedly between BE and PBE.
In our experience, a user's traffic rarely remains in a managed state longer than the initial 15-minute period.</li>
</ul>
<p>These settings may change over time.</p>
<p>Charter generally designates traffic as either "priority best effort" traffic or "best effort" traffic.
Most modern cable modems attached to Charter's network include a "bootfile" which includes information about the subscriber's service account to ensure that the service functions properly.  This bootfile contains information that supports these different priorities for Internet traffic going to and from the cable modem.  Priority best effort is the normal priority.  If congestion management has been triggered and traffic to a particular modem has been designated best effort, traffic could be delayed compared to higher priority traffic.  CMTS ports have what is commonly called a "scheduler" that puts all the packets coming from or going to cable modems on that particular port in a queue and then handles them in turn.
A certain number of packets can be processed by the scheduler in any given moment.
for each time slot, priority best effort traffic will be given priority access to the available capacity, and best effort traffic will be processed on a space-available basis.  A rough analogy would be to busses that empty and fill up every two milliseconds.
As empty busses arrive, the waiting packets fill up the "seats" on the bus.
During non-congested periods, the bus will usually have several empty seats, but during congested periods, the bus will fill up and some packets may have to wait for the next bus.
In congested periods, best effort packets might have to wait for the next bus if all seats are first filled by priority best effort packets.  This all takes place in two millisecond increments, so even if the packets miss 50 "busses," the delay only will be about one-tenth of a second.</p>
<p>Congestion can occur in any IP network, and, when it does, packets can be affected, delayed, lost, or dropped.
Because of this, IP applications and protocols have been designed to deal with delayed or dropped packets.  </p>
<p>Typically, a user whose traffic is in a best effort state during actual congestion may find that a webpage loads sluggishly, a peer-to-peer upload takes somewhat longer to complete, or a VoIP call sounds choppy.  Of course, the same thing could happen to the customers on a port that is congested in the absence of any congestion management.
the difference here is that the effects of any such delays are shifted toward those who have been placing the greatest burden on the network, instead of being distributed randomly among the users of that port without regard to their consumption levels.</p>
<p>Charter's AUP prohibits certain misuse of the service and does not permit a customer to operate a web server, FTP server, file server or game server or to run any other server applications or to provide network or host services to others from a residential account.  Charter is currently retiring DOCSIS 1.0 modems because they are no longer compliant with our network specifications and network performance specifications, and may in the future retire other equipment that impairs the ability of our network to perform.  </p>
<p>Our statements regarding CableCARD use as outlined in our Annual Notice describes Charter's support for CableCARD devices.</p>
<p>
<u>Security</u>
</p>
<p>Charter uses a number of different methods to help protect the security of our customers and network and the availability of our service.  We block the usage of certain ports that are associated with known vulnerabilities.
restrict access to private, internal and management IP space.
and take steps to limit the amount of unsolicited emails you receive at your Charter email address.  In addition, we look for devices that are scanning or attacking our network and, when they originate from our network, we contact our customers to help them secure their device but in some instances we may have to suspend or terminate their service.  To help prevent our network from being overwhelmed, we limit the frequency and volume of certain transactions, such as DHCP requests, email recipients and SMTP sessions.  We modify our security practices from time to time to adapt to new or changed security threats.  Finally, Charter customers that use the Charter Security Suite® can, for example, establish their own firewalls, scan to help identify and remove spyware and viruses, block harmful websites and implement parental controls.  For more information about the Charter Security Suite or to read our security educational materials, please visit www.charter.com/security.</p>
<p>Charter provides a wide variety of Internet services with different speeds and features.
Click here [http://www.charter.com/] for details and typical uses.  Actual uses will vary by customer.  Charter Internet is rated for the speeds indicated, but individual experiences may vary depending on factors such as source and route of traffic outside of our network and periods of peak usage of our network.  Charter is a volunteer currently participating in national performance tests sponsored by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
In its 2011 report, the FCC reported that Charter's national average sustained upload and download performance exceeded advertised speed met advertised speeds over a 24-hour Monday-Sunday basis<br>
</p>
<p>and was greater than 95% of advertised speed during the "busy hour" between 7:00 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m.
on weeknights.  The FCC specifically tested selected downstream and upstream tiers, and recorded performance during the "busy hour" as shown in the table:</p>
