NO IMPERSONATION OR FORGERY <p>Customer will not, or allow others to, impersonate another user, falsify one's user name, company name, age or identity in e-mail or in any post or transmission to any newsgroup or mailing list or other similar groups or lists, or knowingly or unknowingly create or use an e-mail address that has the effect of being misleading.

send Chat Room messages to recipients who have indicated their desire not to receive such messages.
or forge alter, or hide Customer's identity.</p> 13.
NETWORK MANAGEMENT <p>Charter manages its network to deliver the best possible service to all of our customers.
This is necessary because high-speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited.
Additionally, if we did not manage our network, our customers would be subject to the negative effects of "spam," viruses, security attacks, network congestion, and other risks and degradations of service.
To address these risks, Charter uses reasonable network management practices with the goal of relieving network congestion and ensuring that all customers have the opportunity to use the Service with the best available results.
Charter uses tools that it considers to be the least disruptive to the customer experience.</p>
<p>In the case of significantly high bandwidth usage causing congestion (regardless of the usage type or format), Charter may temporarily reduce the available bandwidth to those customers identified as using such high amounts of bandwidth as necessary to reduce bandwidth congestion.
This may cause high bandwidth users to temporarily experience slower Service speeds, but specific network traffic is not targeted for restriction during these times.
While Charter does not guarantee that the network will never experience disruptions, we believe our network management techniques are among the best available for assuring a good customer experience.
Of course, Charter's network management practices will change and evolve, along with the uses of the Internet and the challenges and threats on the Internet.
</p> 14.
NO EXCESSIVE USE OF BANDWIDTH <p>The Service is for residential use and only within limits that Charter considers reasonable for the service level to which Customer subscribes.
Residential service usage for Customers subscribing to the Lite or Express packages should not exceed 100 Gigabytes ("GB") of data per month.
Usage for Customers subscribing to the Plus or Max packages should not exceed 250 GB of data per month and usage for Customers subscribing to the Ultra100 package should not exceed 500 GB of data per month.
Charter reserves the right to revise or implement additional usage limits at any time.</p>
<p>It is a violation of this Policy to use the Service in excess of these limits.
In these cases, Charter may, in its sole discretion, notify Customer of excessive use and (i) request Customer to employ corrective or self-limiting actions to comply with this provision.
(ii) suspend or terminate Customer's Service account.
or (iii) request that Customer subscribe to a version of the Service (such as a commercial grade Internet service, if appropriate) for use at higher data consumption levels that align with Customer's usage patterns.
Charter's determination of the data consumption for Service accounts is final.
</p> 15.
NO ?VIRUSES? <p>Customer will not use, or allow others to use, the Service to transmit computer "viruses," worms, "Trojan horses," denial of service attacks or other harmful software programs or information containing any lock, key, bomb, worm, cancelbot, or other harmful feature.
Customer will use standard practices to prevent the transmission of such viruses, or other harmful software and information.
As software or other content downloaded from the Service may contain viruses, it is Customer's sole responsibility to take appropriate precautions to protect Customer's computer from damage to its software, files and data.
</p> 16.
RIGHT TO MONITOR <p>Neither Charter nor any of its affiliates, suppliers, or agents have any obligation to monitor transmissions or postings (including, but not limited to, e-mail, newsgroup, and instant message transmission as well as materials available on the personal web pages and online storage features) made on the Service.
However, Charter and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents have the right to monitor these transmissions and postings from time to time for violations of this Policy, including for purposes of management of the network and implementing limitation of bandwidth use and to disclose, block, or remove them in accordance with the Subscriber Agreement and any other applicable agreements and policies.</p> 17.
OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS? ACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES <p>Charter obtains services from and relies upon many other entities to provide the Service to Customer.
Where Customer accesses services of other entities through the Service, Customer agrees to and shall abide by the publicized acceptable use policies of such other known entities.</p> 18.
NO WAIVER <p>The failure by Charter or its affiliates to enforce any provision of this Policy at any given point in time shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any future time thereafter.</p> 19.
REVISIONS TO POLICY <p>Charter reserves the right to update or modify this Policy at any time and from time to time with or without prior notice.
Continued use of the Service will be deemed acknowledgment and acceptance of this Policy.
