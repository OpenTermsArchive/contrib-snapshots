<h2>Google Pay/Google Payments Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Last modified: 4 March 2025</p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Google Pay is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/terms/" target="_blank">Google Terms of Service</a>&#xa0;(&#39;Google ToS&#39;) and is a &#39;Service&#39; as defined in the Google ToS. The following Google Pay Terms of Service are additional terms that apply to the use of Google Pay. Your use of Google Pay is subject to these Google Pay Terms of Service and the Google ToS (which together, for purposes of these Google Pay Terms of Service, we refer to as the &#39;Terms&#39;). The <a href="https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/u/0/get_legal_document?ldo=0&amp;ldt=privacynotice&amp;ldl=en-GB" target="_blank">Google Payments Privacy Notice</a>&#xa0;describes how Google handles your payments info. &#xa0;Please note that the <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Terms of Service</a>&#xa0;applies to storing and using items such as loyalty cards, reward program cards, transit passes, boarding passes, and other non-payment items.</p>
<p>If there is any conflict between the Google Pay Terms of Service and the Google ToS, the Google Pay Terms of Service shall prevail. If there is any conflict between the English-language version of the Terms and a version translated into another language, the English-language text shall prevail.</p>
<p>Certain Google Pay features were previously branded &#39;Android Pay&#39;. While you may continue to see legacy references to Android Pay in shops, in apps or on websites, those features are subject to these Terms.</p>
<p>Your use of Google Pay requires that you agree to the following terms. Please read them carefully. Some products and features may not be available in all countries. Please see the <a href="https://support.google.com/pay" target="_blank">Google Pay Help Centre</a>&#xa0;for more information.</p>
<h3>2. Basic requirements</h3>
<p>By agreeing to the Terms, you represent that you are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least as old as the age specified <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409" target="_blank">here</a>; and</li>
	<li>capable of entering into a legally binding agreement with Google.</li></ul>
<p>You will also need a Google Account; a device that meets the Service&#39;s system and compatibility requirements, which may change from time to time; working Internet access; and compatible software. Your ability to use Google Pay, and Google Pay&#39;s performance may be affected by these factors. Such system requirements are your responsibility.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian&#x2019;s permission to use the Service. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the Service, then these Terms apply to you and you&#x2019;re responsible for your child&#x2019;s activity on the Service, including any transactions made by your child using the Service. You also represent that your child is the cardholder or an authorised user of any Payment Method saved to your child&#x2019;s Google Account.</p>
<h3>3. General description of Google Pay</h3>
<p>Google Pay lets you save the following to your Google Account, manage them in one place and transact with Google and third parties using them:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Credit cards, debit cards and other kinds of payment methods that you can use to pay in shops, in apps, on the web and in other ways;</li></ul>
<h3>4. Payment methods</h3>
<p><strong>(a) Types of payment methods</strong></p>
<p>With Google Pay, you can save and manage various kinds of payment methods in your Google Account (collectively, <strong>&#39;Payment Methods&#39;</strong>), including:</p>
<ul><li>Payment cards such as credit, debit and prepaid cards (<strong>&#39;Payment Cards&#39;</strong>)</li>
  <li>Bank-issued virtual account numbers or virtual card numbers representing your Payment Cards (&#39;<strong>Virtual Card Numbers&#39;</strong>&#xa0;or <strong>&#39;Virtual Account Numbers&#39;</strong>)</li>
  <li>Bank accounts</li><li>Operator billing accounts</li><li>Gift cards</li><li>Digital wallets or accounts that you have with companies other than Google (<strong>&#39;Linked Third-Party Accounts&#39;</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Availability of a given Payment Method or its compatibility with Google Pay may depend on your country of residence and other factors. The compatible Payment Method types, as well as the Payment Method uses and Google Pay features described below may not be available everywhere, and may change at any time.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Saving a Payment Method</strong></p>
<p>You may be able to save a Payment Method to your Google Account through a variety of user interfaces, including the Google Pay app or website, the Google Wallet app, the Google Chrome browser, the Payment Method issuer&#39;s app or website, or through a Google product or service such as the Google Play Store. In order to save a Payment Method, you must complete all required information on any registration forms presented to you. The information that you provide must be current, complete and accurate, and you must maintain it as such. We may require you to provide additional information as a condition of continued use of Google Pay, or to help us determine whether to permit you to continue using Google Pay.</p>
<p>When you save a Payment Method, Google may store information relating to the Payment Method, such as your name and billing address. Google Pay also allows you to save other information to your Google Account that can help speed up transactions, such as a delivery address.</p>
<p>You authorise us to confirm that your Payment Method is in good standing with its provider, including, but not limited to, by submitting a request for a payment authorisation and/or a low-value credit and/or debit to the Payment Method, in accordance with network rules or other requirements applicable to the Payment Method.</p>
<p>You agree that Google Pay is for your personal use, with your own Payment Methods. If you use Google Pay with an eligible corporate card, you agree that you are doing so with your employer&#39;s authorisation and with the ability to bind your employer to these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Google&#39;s role</strong></p>
<p>Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are a party to your Payment Methods&#39; cardholder agreements, privacy policy or other terms of use. Nothing in these Terms modifies any such issuer terms. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and your issuer&#39;s terms or privacy policy, these Terms will govern the relationship between you and Google with respect to Google Pay, and your issuer&#39;s terms will govern the relationship between you and the issuer. Google does not make any representation or verify that any of your Payment Methods is in good standing or that the issuer of your Payment Method will authorise or approve any transaction with a merchant or public transport provider when you use Google Pay for that transaction.</p>
<p>Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are involved in issuing credit or determining eligibility for credit, nor do they exercise control over: the availability or accuracy of Payment Methods or funds; the provisioning (or addition) of Payment Methods to Google Pay or addition of funds to Payment Method balances. For any concerns relating to the foregoing, please contact your Payment Method&#39;s issuer.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Saving a Virtual Card Number, Public Transport Pass, or Linked Third-Party Account </strong> </p>
<p>The following additional terms apply when using Google Pay to save a Virtual Card Number, Public Transport Pass, or Linked Third-Party Account to your Google Account.</p>
<p>After you have begun to add a Payment Method to Google Pay and provided the information requested by Google and/or your Payment Method issuer, Google Pay will check whether the Payment Method is eligible to be used with Google Pay. All of a participating issuer&#39;s Payment Methods may not be eligible. If your Payment Method&#39;s issuer supports Google Pay and your Payment Method is eligible, when adding it you may see a screen asking you to accept the issuer&#39;s terms and conditions. Once you have done so and successfully added the Payment Method, Google Pay will store a Virtual Card Number representing your payment card&#39;s actual card number, or associate your Public Transport Pass or Linked Third-Party Account with your Google Account, for use as described in Section 5 below.</p>
<p>Virtual Card Numbers that you register using Google Pay are distinct from any associated Payment Cards that you save to your Google Account. Unlike a Virtual Card Number, a Payment Card will generally not be presented to you with card art resembling the associated physical card and cannot be used for in-store Near-Field Communication (&#39;NFC&#39;) transactions. However, when you register a Virtual Card Number, Google Pay may also save the associated Payment Card in your Google Account as well.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Google Pay may receive transaction information from your Payment Method&#39;s issuer to display richly formatted transaction details and your recent transaction history in Google Pay.</p>
<p>A Payment Method may be removed from Google Pay on a given device and become unusable with the Service if: (i) you delete the Payment Method from Google Pay; (ii) you delete the Payment Method from your Google Account; (iii) you erase your mobile device using Android Device Manager; (iv) you delete your Google Account; (v) your mobile device fails to connect to any Google product or service for 90 consecutive days; (vi) you do not use Google Pay on the device for 12 consecutive months; and/or (vii) your Payment Method&#39;s issuer or payment network instructs Google to remove the Payment Method from Google Pay.</p>
<h3>5. Transacting with Payment Methods</h3>
<p><strong>(a) On Google properties</strong></p>
<p>Google Pay may allow you to initiate a payment transaction with a &#39;Seller&#39;, defined as (i) a Google group company or (ii) any other seller participating in one or more of Google&#39;s marketplaces (as listed <a href="https://support.google.com/paymentscenter/answer/9031403?p=google_marketplaces&amp;visit_id=636785063042510889-22186422&amp;rd=1" target="_blank">here</a>) that offers merchandise, goods or services for sale to you, and that requests Google or its affiliates to process payment transactions on its behalf.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that your transaction with a Seller (a &#39;Google Transaction&#39;) is solely between you and the Seller. Google and its affiliates are not party to your Google Transactions and related purchases, nor are they buyer or seller in connection with any Google Transaction, unless expressly designated as such (for example, in the listing or description of the relevant merchandise, good or service on a Google-operated website or interface).</p>
<p>When you initiate a Google Transaction, Google may present your available Payment Methods to you at the time of transaction. After you select the Payment Method that you wish to use, Google may charge that Payment Method, or else share the Payment Method and related details with one of its affiliates, which will then process the transaction on behalf of the Seller. You authorise the charge or debit to your Payment Method as necessary to complete processing of a Google Transaction. You also authorise any crediting to your Payment Method in connection with reversals, refunds or adjustments related to a Google Transaction.</p>
<p>For details or terms relating to a specific Google Transaction, including refund or dispute resolution policies, please refer to the terms of service, help centre or other support materials provided by the Seller with which you transacted.</p>
<p>If there is a problem charging your selected Payment Method, Google may charge any other valid Payment Method that you have saved to Google Pay. Visit the <a href="https://pay.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Pay website</a>, Google Pay app or Google settings on your Android device to manage your payment options. You also agree that a Seller may resubmit a Google Transaction for a purchase to the payment network for processing one or more times in the event that a prior Google Transaction is declined or returned by the payment network. Google may delay payment processing of suspicious transactions or transactions that may involve fraud, misconduct or violate applicable law, the Terms or other applicable Google policies, as determined at Google&#39;s sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>If a Seller offers you the ability to pay for subscriptions, your subscription will start when you click &#39;accept and buy&#39; (or an equivalent phrase) on a subscription purchase. This is a recurring billing transaction. Unless otherwise stated, your subscription and the relevant billing authorisation will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you. By clicking &#39;accept and buy&#39; (or equivalent), you authorise the Seller to bill your chosen Payment Method each designated billing period for the subscription. The Google Transaction amount is subject to change by the Seller during the subscription period. Cancellation of a subscription will not become effective until the end of the current billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period and will continue to be able to access the relevant subscription for the remainder of the current billing period.</p>
<p><strong>(b) With third parties</strong></p>
<p>When you initiate a payment or public transport transaction using Google Pay with any party other than a Seller (such party is a &#39;Third Party&#39;&#xa0;and such transaction is a &#39;Third-Party Transaction&#39;), Google may pass details of your Payment Method and related information to the Third Party so that it can charge your Payment Method. Depending on the nature of the Third Party, a Third-Party Transaction may be for the purchase of goods or services, for public transport rides or for other purposes, such as charitable donations or gifts. A Third-Party Transaction may be initiated when you: use tap-and-pay in shops or on public transport services using NFC, barcodes or other contactless technology; select &#39;Google Pay&#39; or &#39;Buy with Google Pay&#39; as a payment option in an online transaction on the Third Party&#39;s website or app; or transact with the Third Party through some other online interface, such as via the Google Assistant. When you initiate an online transaction, Google Pay may also share other information, such as a billing, delivery or email address saved in your Google Account, where relevant to completing the transaction.</p>
<p>In a Third-Party Transaction, after passing the Payment Method and other details to the Third Party, Google will have no further involvement in the transaction, and you acknowledge and agree that such transaction is solely between you and the Third Party and not with Google or any of its affiliates. You should contact the Third Party or your Payment Method provider (for example, the issuer of your Payment Card) directly regarding any issues with Third-Party Transactions, including refunds and disputes.</p>
<p>When you visit a participating Third Party&#39;s website or app, Google may disclose to the Third Party whether or not you have Google Pay set up on your device if requested by the Third Party so that the Third Party knows whether to offer you Google Pay as a payment option. However, you may still see the Google Pay payment option on a Third Party&#x2019;s website or app if the Third Party offers Google Pay as a payment option to all users. You can opt out of Google making this disclosure in the Google Pay <a href="https://pay.google.com/payments/u/0/home?page=privacySettings#privacySettings:" target="_blank">privacy settings</a>. Opting out could affect your ability to use Google Pay with certain merchants. If you&#x2019;re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, this does not apply to you and Google won&#x2019;t disclose your information for this purpose. </p>
<p><strong>(c) As part of Chrome or Android AutoFill</strong></p>
<p>If you have enabled the &#39;AutoFill&#39; feature on the Google Chrome browser or on your Android device, Google Pay may also present you with the option of automatically populating your saved Payment Method and address information in a Third-Party website&#39;s payment form on the Chrome browser, or in a Third-Party app&#39;s payment form on an Android device. (For more information on how AutoFill works with Google Pay, consult the Chrome Help Centre). When you use this feature, Google is not interacting with the Third-Party website or app, and is only completing your request to automatically fill certain selected information in a Third-Party form. Google has no involvement in any transaction that you complete using Chrome or Android AutoFill, and you acknowledge and agree that such transaction is solely between you and the Third Party and not with Google or its affiliates. You should contact the Third Party or your Payment Method issuer directly regarding any issues with a transaction in which you used Chrome or Android AutoFill.</p>
