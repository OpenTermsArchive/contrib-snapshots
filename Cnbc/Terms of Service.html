<p>CNBC provides users with access to a rich collection of resources related to financial and business news, such as CNBC video programming, financial tools and news analysis (the "Content").

monthly or yearly) or on a pay-per-use basis.<br>
</p>

In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.</p>
<p>Generally<br>
</p>
<p>The Service may offer certain services (including without limitation, CNBC Plus) for which we charge a fee that is billed in regular increments (e.g.
monthly or yearly) in order for registered users to access the service ("Subscription Services")</p>
<p>Free Trials</p>
<p>From time to time, we may offer our Subscription Services (including without limitation, CNBC Plus) through a free trial.
Free trials are only available to first time subscribers of the Subscription Service and cannot be combined with any other offer.
Only one free trial may be redeemed per person.
You must have Internet access, valid email address and a valid credit card ("Payment Method") to redeem a free trial offer.
Upon registering for your free trial, your Payment Method will be authorized for the length of subscription indicated during the registration process.
In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may reflect the authorization.
however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.</p>
<p>At the end of any free trial period, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the indicated subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plus any applicable tax unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial.
You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that your paying subscription has begun.
YOU MUST CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL OFFER TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.
CLICK THE "MEMBER CENTER" LINK AT THE HOME PAGE OF THE SERVICE FORCANCELLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a regular basis for your subscription plan until you cancel.
You may cancel your subscription at anytime.
We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans.
Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly, or year or yearly refers to your billing cycle (See "Billing" below).</p>
<p>Subscription fees are subject to change.
In the event of a change in any subscription fee, a notice regarding the subscription fee change will be posted at the Member Center or you will be sent an email prior to the effective date of the fee change.
It is the sole responsibility of the subscribers to check this page from time to time for any such notices.</p>
<p>Credit Card Billing</p>
<p>By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you are expressly agreeing that we are permitted to bill you a periodic (e.g., monthly or yearly) subscription fee, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Subscription Service.
As used in these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate a charge against your Payment Method.
YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDE.
The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each periodic renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership.
We will automatically bill your Payment Method each period on the calendar day corresponding to the day after your free trial has ended.
In the event a monthly membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we will bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month.
For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28th.
If you received a free trial, your Payment Method will be authorized for the approximate period of service indicated during registration for the free trial.
however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.
All fees, taxes and charges are nonrefundable.
There will be no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless required by applicable law.
We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by posting a notice at the Member Center or by e-mail.
If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by clicking on the "Member Center" button, available at the top of the home page of the Service.
If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Subscription Service constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
If a charge to your credit card is denied for any reason, CNBC shall have the right to terminate or suspend your subscription and your access to the Subscription Service.</p>
<p>Automatic Renewals</p>
<p>Your subscription to a Subscription Service will be automatically renewed on a periodic (e.g., monthly or yearly) basis.
We will bill the applicable subscription fee plus any applicable tax to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).
Your subscription will automatically renew for successive periodic subscriptions, without prior notice to you, unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews each period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method.</p>
<p>Cancellation</p>
<p>You may cancel your subscription to a Subscription Service at anytime, and cancellation will be effective at the end of the applicable period during which you notify CNBC of your cancellation.
WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-PERIOD SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR UNUSED SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
To cancel, click the word "Unsubscribe" on the "Member Center" page and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>CNBC reserves the right to discontinue any Subscription Service at any time, and to cancel your subscription in connection with the discontinuation of the Subscription Service.

We note that you should review the specific rules for a particular Promotion to determine whether you are eligible to participate in such Promotion.
By participating in any such Promotion, you will become subject to any specific rules applicable to such Promotion, which may vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein.
CNBC urges you to review any specific rules applicable to a particular Promotion, which will be linked from such Promotion, and to review our Privacy Policy which, in addition to this Agreement, governs any information you submit in connection with such activities.
