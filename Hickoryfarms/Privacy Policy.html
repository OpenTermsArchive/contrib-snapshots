<p>(a)    Cookies.  A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive.  Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use both of them: </p>
<p>(1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and</p>
<p>(2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.</p>
<p>We use the following categories of cookies on our Website.</p>
<p>i.    Strictly Necessary Cookies.  These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features.
Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as maintaining a record of your purchased items (e.g.
a shopping cart), cannot be provided.</p>
<p>ii.    Performance Cookies.  These cookies collect anonymous information on how people use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our site, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve, such as navigation.
The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established.</p>
<p>iii.    Functionality Cookies.  These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters.
This information can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make your visits to our Website more tailored to your preferences.
The information in these cookies may be anonymized.   These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
<p>iv.    Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies.
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.  The cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks.  These cookies remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties such as Google Ad Network advertisers.</p>
<p>Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings.
However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality.</p>

This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>(d)    <em>Third-party Websites and Services.</em>  We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology.
