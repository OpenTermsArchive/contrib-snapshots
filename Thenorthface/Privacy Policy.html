<p>
<b>3.
Earning Peak Points</b>
</p>
<p>A.
Peak Points can be earned during a Peak Points
Year.  Once a Peak Points Year has

Peak Points Year and you will start at zero again for the new Peak Points Year.</p>
<p>B.

and automatically receive ten (10) Peak Points for every $1 (USD) spent on any
eligible product that is purchased (a "Qualifying Purchase," as
further described below).  The Peak
Points will be added into your VIPeak account when you provide at the time of
purchase your email address or phone number used to become a Member.  If you did not provide your email
address or phone number at the time of purchase, you may call Customer Service
at 888-TNF-1968 / 888-863-1968 and upon verification by Customer Service of
your purchase or activity and that you did not previously receive Peak Points
for the purchase or activity, the Peak Points will be added into your Program
account.</p>
<p>C.
Qualifying Purchases include regular and sale priced
merchandise in The North Face Stores and online at www.thenorthface.com.  Peak Points will not be earned for
purchases made through any outlet stores selling North Face products.
No Peak
Points are earned when purchasing Gift Cards or eGift Cards from The North
Face, but you do earn Peak Points when redeeming a Gift Card or an eGift Card
at The North Face Stores or online at www.thenorthface.com.  In addition, no Peak Points are earned
for payment of sales tax, gift boxes or wrapping, or for shipping and handling
costs..</p>
<p>D.
Peak Points may also be earned for participation in
certain activities designated and announced by The North Face during the Peak
Points Year.  Example activities
could include: connecting with The North Face on social media, participating in
the Endurance Challenge, initial sign up for email from The North Face or
making a Clothestheloop donation. 
Members may also be able to earn bonus Peak Points for making purchases
of designated products or during a designated time as determined and announced
by The North Face.
The North Face reserves the right to make bonus Peak Points
and other promotional offers available to select Members based on purchase
activity, geographic location, Program participation, and/or information
supplied by the Member.  The North
Face reserves the right to add, withdraw, amend, or otherwise change bonus
opportunities at any time at its sole discretion, with or without notice to
Members.</p>
<p>E.
The Peak Points you have earned through a purchase
(including bonus Peak Points for designated products, if applicable) by
providing your phone or email address at the time of purchase, will be netted
from your overall Peak Points total if the item is returned.  Returns of merchandise purchased in the
prior Peak Points Year will be deducted from the Member's Peak Points balance
in the current Peak Points Year. 
Negative Peak Point balances never expire.  Peak Points have no cash value.  You cannot give or transfer your Peak Points to anyone else.</p>

<p>C.
Each Reward Certificate will contain a unique code and
pin that may be used at The North Face Stores by providing the associate the
code and pin or at www.thenorthface.com by entering the code and pin during
checkout.  Prior to a Reward
Certificate expiring, if the entire value of the Reward Certificate is not used
when making a purchase, the remaining value of the Reward Certificate will be
available for use with purchases from The North Face until no value remains on
the Reward Certificate or it expires, whichever occurs first.  Reward Certificates may be redeemed at
the same time as using The North Face coupons, certificates, discounts, or
offers toward the purchase of products. 
Reward Certificates are not redeemable for cash and no change/currency
will be given for Reward Certificate redemption.</p>
<p>D.
The code and pin on your Reward Certificate may be
used by anyone, and you are solely responsible for protecting it from
unauthorized use.
If the unique code and pin for the Reward Certificate that is
sent to you is used in a manner that was not authorized by you (even if the
Reward Certificate is lost or stolen), The North Face will not replace Reward
Certificate.  However, if you
delete or lose the email in which you received your Reward Certificate, contact
Customer Service at 888-TNF-1968 / 888-863-1968 and upon verification by
Customer Service of your membership, an email with the same unique code and pin
Reward Certificate will be resent to you.</p>
<p>E.
The products and experiences available in the VIPeak
Reward Catalog will be selected solely in the discretion of The North
Face.  Items in the VIPeak Reward
Catalog will be available while supplies last, so it is possible that an item
selected by a Member from the VIPeak Reward Catalog will not be available.</p>
<p>F.
The North Face, in its sole discretion, may elect to
change the Peak Perks and/or the value of the Peak Points at the beginning of
any Peaks Point Year.  This could
include no longer providing the VIPeak Catalog or changing the valuation of the
Reward Certificate.</p>
<p>G.
VIPeak Members may also have early access to special
events and be invited to participate in exclusive experiences for VIPeak
Members.</p>

Certificates.
At our discretion we may prosecute abuse of the Program to the
