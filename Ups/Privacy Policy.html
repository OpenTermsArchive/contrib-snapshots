</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit our websites, use our apps, or interact with UPS-related tools, widgets or plug-ins, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.
The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier,  browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity.   A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or apps to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server.
Through these automated collection methods, we obtain and store "clickstream data" to tell us usage patterns.  We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you.
We also may use third-party analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites or apps.
