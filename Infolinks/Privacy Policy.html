<p>When End Users visit a Digital Property that uses our technology, we (and our partners or vendors) use and deploy tracking technologies like cookies to automatically collect certain information about the End Users and their devices.  Some of this information (including, for example, unique identifiers stored in a cookie or mobile advertising IDs) may identify a computer or device and may be “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU.  However, our Ad Services and Technology are designed to process information in such a manner that the information cannot be directly attributed to a specific, identifiable individual without the use of additional information (such as your name, address, or email address). In addition, we adhere to individual privacy laws in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We (and our partners or vendors) may collect this information the first time an End User interacts with a Publisher Client’s Digital Property that uses our Ad Services, and we may combine and associate this information with information we (or our partners) may collect about the End User’s interactions with other ads served through our Platform.</p>
<p>The information we may collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser and Device information, such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android), web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari), user-agent, carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), IP address, general location inferred from IP address, information about our Publisher Client’s apps and versions currently active on a device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to a device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (typically an alphanumeric string allocated to a device by the device manufacturer, a Publisher Client’s Digital Property, or Infolinks, including identifiers stored in a cookie, or browser or web cache).</li>
<li>Information about an End User’s behavior on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties, such as information about the activities or actions on those Digital Properties, session start/stop time, and geolocation (including latitude and longitude coordinates, but only if the Publisher Client’s Digital Property (like an app) has enabled location services on the device and the End User has granted the Publisher Client permission to collect and share this information for advertising purposes).</li>
<li>Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether the End User clicked on it, the number of times an End User has seen the ad, and whether the End User visited the Media Buyer’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information we receive from third parties</p>
<p>We may also combine, merge and/or enhance the information we collect about an End User with information collected from our Publisher Clients and third parties (like our data providers).  For example, our Publisher Clients may also collect information that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Ad Services or through application programming interfaces (APIs), when our Ad Services connect to their systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.2       HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes.  For example, we use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serving Ads: To allow Publisher Clients to offer advertising inventory in their Digital Properties and Media Buyers to bid on and fill that inventory with relevant ads.</li>
<li>Ad Reporting and Conversions: To provide information and reports to Media Buyers about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their Digital Property.</li>
<li>Fraud Detection and Prevention and Security: To identify invalid ad impressions, clicks, installs, or ad queries, protect us and our Publisher Clients from fraudulent behavior, and protect the security of the Ad Services.</li>
<li>Frequency Capping: To prevent End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.</li>
<li>Customizing Ads: To infer End Users’ likely commercial interests (<em>g</em>., sports or travel) based on their activities across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time, including to build interest-based advertising segments or audiences, as well as to supplement the information we collect with additional information we receive from third parties, such as third-party advertising segments or audiences, to allow us to customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to End Users and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting exposure to less relevant ads).</li>
<li>Performance Analytics: To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.</li>
<li>Contextual-Based Advertising: To serve contextually relevant targeted ads to an End User on behalf of our Clients based on the End User’s activity across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time and information regarding an End User’s inferred commercial interests.</li>
<li>Location-Based Advertising: To deliver location-based advertising, services, and content in real-time using your device’s physical location (where permitted by law).</li>
<li>Providing, Managing, and Improving our Ad Services and Developing New Services: To facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Ad Services, as well as auditing, researching, and analyzing information to provide, protect, manage, and improve our Ad Services, develop new services, and ensure that our technologies function properly.</li>
<li>Service Usage and Support: To calculate usage levels of the Ad Services, help diagnose server problems, and administer the Ad Services.</li>
<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside an End User’s country of residence; (b) to comply with subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside an End User’s country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, End Users, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.3       COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies and other similar tracking technologies (such as pixel tags and web or browser caches) to collect information automatically from End Users’ devices.  They help us identify unique browsers or devices used by an End User and to perform functions like, for example, limiting the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties, and serving an ad to the End User.  To opt out of our use of such technologies for interest-based advertising purposes. </p>

<p>If you are an End User, we may retain information that we collect through the Ad Services based on our data retention limitations, or indefinitely.  We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes.  If we de-identify information we collect through the Ad Services, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely.  In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.  If we are required to retain information to comply with a legal or audit obligation, we may store End User information for longer periods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO MAKE A DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS REQUEST</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to make a data subject rights request, please follow the steps described below:</p>
<p>Step 1: Locate Your Digital Identifiers</p>
<p>In order for us to locate relevant records, we will need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers. You can find your Digital Identifiers as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Web Browsing</u></li>
</ul>
<p>As described throughout the Privacy Policy our technology operates by using text files called “cookies” that are placed on your device. See the applicable policy for more information about the cookies we use, and how to manage cookies and other similar technologies. Some of the cookies we use include a Digital Identifier. To locate these Digital Identifiers, you can search through your cookies for the cookies named in our cookie policies (which are set from the Infolinks domain). The text in each of these cookies is a separate Digital Identifier.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that different cookies are placed on each browser and device that you use to access the Internet. As a result, if you use multiple browsers (for example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox) and devices (for example, a laptop computer and a mobile phone), you will need to locate the applicable cookies for each browser and device.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Mobile Devices</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, certain mobile devices (for example, mobile phones or tablets using the iOS or Android operating systems) generate a persistent “Advertising Identifier” per device, which, among other things, can be used by third parties for purposes of providing you with targeted advertising. On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “IDFA,” “IFA,” or an “ID for Advertising.” On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “Advertising ID.” Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifiers.</p>
<p>Step 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers</p>
<p>In order to make sure that we are responding only to the person who is authorized to make the access request, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that you are indeed connected to the Digital Identifiers you located in Step 1. For Digital Identifiers stored in cookies, please take a screenshot of each cookie, taking care to make sure that the screenshot shows both the name of the cookie and the full Digital Identifier. For Digital Identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of a screen that displays the Digital Identifier. Additionally, please fill out, sign and include in your request the ‘Infolinks Data Authorization Form’ in Section -A- below that we have prepared, which attests that the Digital Identifiers you have located are indeed associated with you. By signing the form, you declare, under penalty of perjury, that all statements made on the form are true, and you must also have a witness sign and date the form. By signing the form, the witness declares, under penalty of perjury, that your signature on the form is genuine. In addition, you and the witness must each provide a copy of one identifying document, such as a passport or driver’s license. The names on the document copies must match the printed names on the Authorization Verification Form. We require these steps to help us verify that you, as the data subject of the personal information you have requested, are authorized to request and receive such personal information.</p>
<p>Step 3: Contact Us</p>
<p>Once you have located your Digital Identifiers and can provide us with verification of those Digital Identifiers as instructed above, please contact us with details of the data subject rights you wish to exercise. The easiest way to do so is to email us at info@infolinks.com.  Your completed Authorization Verification Form located below in SECTION -A- and required documentation must be attached to the email as PDF files.  Please make sure to include the following information in your email:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your full name</li>
<li>The country in which you are located at the time you are making your request</li>
<li>The data subject rights you wish to exercise</li>
<li>A full list of your Digital Identifiers</li>
<li>Supporting proof, as described in Step 2</li>
<li>A signed Authorization Verification Form (with witness signature), linked in Step 2</li>
<li>The identity documents described in Step 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also make a data subject rights request by postal mail, by sending a written request with all of the above-listed information to our contact address:</p>
