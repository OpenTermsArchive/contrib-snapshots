 GCI Privacy Policy The GCI Commitment
<p>GCI is committed to delivering quality, innovative communications services to our customers.
From the time you sign up for GCI services, as you use these services, and as we provide additional services as part of our customer relationship, you entrust with us your information.
This information enables us to provide and support services, and the ability to improve, develop, and market services and content to enhance our customers’ experience.</p>
<p>Because your information is important to us, we use reasonable and appropriate technical, security, and procedural measures as a safeguard to mitigate the chances of loss, misuse, and unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we describe your personally identifiable information, its use and our commitment to protect it, and how federal laws additionally apply to the individual services used by you.</p>
Scope of Privacy Policy
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information generated, delivered, or collected through your use of GCI local and long distance, wireless voice and data, video, and internet services (individually and in any combination), as identified below.
This policy also applies to visitors to www.gci.com and my.gci.com.</p>
<p>Information may be collected when you provide it directly to us, such as by signing up for service or registering a user account (for example, your contact and billing information) and when generated from your use of our services (for example, network or service performance data, device settings, and usage data).</p>
Personally Identifiable Information (Personal Information)
<p>Your use of GCI services will sometimes generate, deliver, or collect “personally identifiable information” (Personal Information).
Personal Information is data associated with you that (1) is not already publicly available and (2) specifically identifies who you are.
The type of Personal Information collected, which may vary depending on your subscribed services, may include such items as your<b>
</b>state driver’s license/ID number, social security number, credit/debit card number, bank account number, or similar account information.
Aggregate or anonymous information that does not identify who you are when used by itself is not Personal Information.</p>
<p>More specifically, when linked with the identity of a specific person, Personal Information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Customer Proprietary Network Information</em> (“CPNI”) as defined below (such as the quantity, technical configuration, location of certain telecommunication services used, all of which may be linked to your name, address, and phone number);</li>
<li>equipment and technical information (such as data about your video equipment, computer hardware and software, modems, routers, device settings, computer and internet connections, including IP addresses, operating systems, browser types and other applications);</li>
<li>location information (such as data about your wireless device when it is turned on);</li>
<li>service usage data (such as minutes used, bandwidth used, cable box viewing data).
and</li>
<li>information about activity on GCI websites (such as IP addresses, web addresses of sites visited before and after visiting GCI websites, and other statistical data about visits).</li>
</ul>Use and Protection of Personal Information
<p>We use this information for a number of different purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To monitor and maintain performance on GCI networks and devices;</li>
<li>To develop, support, and deliver purchased products and services, to carry out billing and collection, and to answer your questions related to these services;</li>
<li>To deliver more relevant and tailored marketing messages regarding other GCI products or services that may be of interest;</li>
<li>To enforce our legal rights, protect GCI, and protect our users against fraud, abuse, and unlawful acts.
and</li>
<li>For other purposes we disclose to you when you provide your Personal Information, such as when you participate in surveys and promotions.</li>
</ul>
<p>GCI is committed to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information.
We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative measures in place to mitigate the chance of unauthorized access to or improper use of your information and  will continue to enhance security procedures as appropriate.</p>
<p>Because no security tool can provide absolute protection, however, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will not be subject to inadvertent disclosure through illegal or unauthorized acts by third parties.
In the unlikely event of inadvertent disclosure, we will notify you as required by law.</p>
<p>In the course of providing your services, GCI may share Personal Information with our affiliates, contractors, service providers, business partners, and other third parties we use to support our business and provide customers with services.
These third parties will be contractually bound to protect your Personal Information and prohibited from using such information for any other purpose.
Subject to the above, without your consent, GCI will not sell, trade, or disclose Personal Information that would specifically identify a customer, unless and except to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, GCI may be required to disclose Personal Information without your consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with any court order, law, or other legal process, including requests by the government or regulators;</li>
<li>To enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
and</li>
<li>If necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of GCI, our customers, or others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a merger, sale, transfer, restructuring, or any other reorganization of some or all of GCI’s assets, your Personal Information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor.</p>
Information Not Covered by this Policy
<p>Our Privacy Policy does not cover any information you may provide to companies other than GCI, including service or providers you may access in the course of using GCI services.</p>
<p>Our business partners may have separate product or service agreements that govern confidentiality, security, and information management.
We work to ensure our partners follow standards and practices consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Those partners may provide you with additional privacy notices, which we encourage you to review.
To the extent you provide Personal Information directly to them, such information will be subject to their respective privacy policies.
For example, you may elect to access Netflix through GCI video or internet service.
The information you convey to Netflix is not covered by GCI’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You also may access websites or services via your internet or wireless data connections, and in doing so, you may convey or provide information to other providers.
GCI’s Privacy Policy does not apply to this information.</p>
<p>GCI’s website may contain links to other websites, including those of third parties that act on our behalf as agents, suppliers, or providers and that may have their own privacy policies.
You should be aware that your information may be provided or conveyed by clicking on a link to another company’s website or advertisement from our website.</p>
<p>
<i>We do not control the tracking practices of third parties.
We encourage you to consult the privacy policies of third parties whose services you use, as well as websites you visit and with which you do business to learn more about how those parties may use your information.</i>
