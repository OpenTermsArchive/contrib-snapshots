You will be notified via email or by a notice on our Website of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.
Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties.
We may disclose your Personal Information to prevent an emergency, to prevent harm to others, to respond to legal requirements, to protect or enforce our rights and policies, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a subpoena or court order).

Disclosure to Content Owners.
If you purchase a product from a Shop, CafePress may provide your name, and the city and state information provided by you to the Content Owner.
In the Content Owner Agreement, CafePress contractually obligates each Content Owner not to use or disclose this information for any purposes other than internal record keeping, and for marketing their Shops, only if you have opted in to receive marketing material directly from the Content Owner.

Internet Advertising.
We may use third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Website.
They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services.
They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services.

Most websites use cookies.
We use cookies to track your use of the Website and the CafePress Services, provide you with a more personalized user experience, and to allow you to login and begin use of the CafePress Services automatically when you visit the Website.
A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed on a web page or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Website or receiving the e-mail.
Cookies and web beacons used by CafePress and our online partners are not linked to Personal Information.
Some of our Content Owners may use cookies or web beacons on our Website.
We have no access to or control over these cookies and web beacons.

Does CafePress Protect My Personal Information? Personal Information.
Whenever we obtain your Personal Information, we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.
However, we are not insurers of the security of your Personal Information.
Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.

Security The security of your Personal Information is important to us.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
