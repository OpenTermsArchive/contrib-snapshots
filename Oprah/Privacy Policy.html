In addition, when you are on the Sites you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.

OWN encourages you to note when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites before submitting any Personal Information to those sites.

Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.

Third party cookies (including flash cookies) and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Site, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.

We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of third party network advertisers.
