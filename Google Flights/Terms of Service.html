        Booking through Google Flight Search
      </h3>
      <p>
        On Google’s Flight Search website, you can make a booking request for some airlines’
        flights. By completing the required fields of the booking request screen on Google Flight
        Search, and submitting the booking request by clicking on the "Book" button, you will make
        a binding booking request to the respective airline or online travel agent and enter into an
        agreement with and
        authorize Google to pass your booking request information through to the airline
        and/or the online travel agent identified on the booking request screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google acts as an intermediary only, and we cannot control whether your booking request is
        accepted by the airline and/or the online travel agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to completing and submitting your booking request, you should carefully check all of
        the information that you have entered. You will be given an opportunity to review and
        correct the information that you have entered prior to completing and submitting sending
        your booking
        request.
      </p>
      <p>
        All tickets issued by airlines for bookings made through Google Flight Search are
        electronic tickets (e-tickets). All bookings are stored in the global distribution
        system of the airline and/or online travel agent, and the airline and/or online travel agent
        will
        send you the corresponding reference and e-ticket number directly along with the booking
        confirmation email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google’s contractual obligation is limited to passing your booking request through to the
        respective airline and/or online travel agent, and we will not provide any other
        booking-related services. Specifically, Google is under no obligation to provide the
        transportation service in question. Google is not a party to the contract between you and
        the airline and/or online travel agent that you book with through Google Flight Search.
      </p>

        Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policies</a>
        explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy
        when using Google Flight Search. Google will need to provide your personal information, such
        as your traveller and payment details, to airlines and/or online travel agents for the

      <h3>
        Airline’s Terms and Conditions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Any flight that you book through Google Flight Search is governed by the terms and
        conditions of the airline that you book your flight with, including its conditions of
        carriage and any other terms that you may view in the course of the booking process using
        the hyperlinks on Google Flight Search (“<b>Airline Terms and Conditions</b>”). Google is
        not responsible for the content of the Airline’s Terms and Conditions. The
        Airline's Terms and Conditions may contain provisions on passengers’ transportation and
        baggage (including dangerous goods), cancellations, rebooking or refunds, payment, delays,
        annulments and denied boarding, liability, as well as additional booking and fare rules.
        It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself and comply with the Airline's Terms and
        Conditions. Additionally, online travel agents may impose their own terms and conditions –
        such as additional fees for change/refund requests – that supplement the Airline's Terms
        and Conditions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Flight documents
      </h3>
      <p>
        The respective airlines’ rules regarding the documents that you must show to prove your

        subject to the Airline's Terms and Conditions. Many airlines reserve the right to make
        schedule changes and cancel confirmed bookings, and supplemental terms and conditions of
        online travel agents may also apply. Google is not responsible for such schedule
        changes or cancellations, and we do not have any control over them. Please contact the
        airline or online travel agent if you have any questions or would like to cancel or make changes to your booking.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Please also observe the provisions on the carriage of baggage contained in the Airline's
        Terms and Conditions, as airlines may impose extra fees for carry-on, checked, oversized or excess
        baggage that is not included in the payment of the total price of the booking made through
        Google Flight Search.
      </p>

        Means of payment
      </h3>

        Account. If you do not have a Google Payments Account, you can pay using a credit or debit
        card. You must agree to the payment terms as specified in the Google Payments <a
