<p>
</p>
A.
The information we gather <p>We gather two (2) types of information about users:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Non-personally identifiable information (information that does not identify a specific individual): When visitors use the Services, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Services.
Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities.
In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.
We collect non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of “cookies.” For more information, read our section entitled “Cookies” below.</li>
<li>
Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the Services, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your resume, create a new account, or enter SlashDot Media-sponsored contests or promotions, we may request that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, zip code, profession, or work experience.
We will, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional.</li>
</ol>
<p>SlashDot Media services are not available to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>
</p>
B.
How we use the information we gather <p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather.
Keep in mind that, while we encourage all third parties involved, including but not limited to its advertisers, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and users and to otherwise handle personally identifiable information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from us or independently.
Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with us, or who claims association with us, who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact privacy@slashdotmedia.com.</p>
<ol>
<li>
How we use non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services.
We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners.
We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their sites.</li>
<li>
How we use personally identifiable information: We may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to our business, including, but not limited: <ol>
<li>To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user;</li>
<li>To generate statistical studies;</li>
<li>To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;</li>
<li>To notify user referrals of SlashDot Media services, information, or products when a user requests that we send such information to referrals.
</li>
<li>To improve services, information, and products;</li>
<li>To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support to users and to recipients of SlashDot Media products;</li>
<li>To communicate with the user and with recipients of SlashDot Media products and services;</li>
<li>To email users about services, information, products and offers from our business partners (and as set forth in the Section How we share information we gather);</li>
<li>To personalize a Site for the user;</li>
<li>To notify the user of any changes with a Site which may affect the user;</li>
<li>To enforce terms of use on a Site;</li>
<li>To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects.
and</li>
<li>To allow us to contact you by phone and/or email.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>User names, identifications (“IDs”), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on a Site when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personally identifiable information, such as when a user posts personally identifiable information in conjunction with content subject to an open source license, uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application.
Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted.
Such personally identifiable information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personally identifiable information that a user chooses to submit to public pages.</p>
<p>With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey.
We will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users, i.e., anonymous information that does not identify any specific individual.
Circumstances under which we would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to our advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.
Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where we advise users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, we reserve the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personally identifiable information identifying a specific user is disclosed.
Participation in surveys is at a user’s option.
 We do not conduct mandatory surveys.</p>
<p>
</p>
C.
How we share information we gather <p>Subject to the foregoing, we use your personally identifiable information in several ways.
We may share your personal information with service providers to help us with our business activities such as processing credit cards, email marketing, offering customer service, or operating a community forum.
 These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We require that these third parties establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we provide them.
We take steps to ensure they subscribe to Safe Harbor, are subject to EU Directive or another adequacy finding, or we enter into a written agreement requiring that they provide at least the same level of protection as required by relevant Safe Harbor principles.</p>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to share aggregate information collected from users of the Sites, without prior notice, with entities that are part of the SlashDot Media corporate family and unrelated third parties.
Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.</p>
<p>We may share certain data from SourceForge.net, Freecode.com, and Slashdot.org with researchers and research organizations for the purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on free and/or open source software.
 We may further choose to establish agreements for these parties to act in a clearinghouse capacity and authorize them to share this data with other researchers studying free and/or open source software.
 When data from these websites is transmitted to researchers, we make commercially reasonable efforts to remove personally identifiable information from data fields designed to capture personally identifiable information (other than user names and information that users have made publicly available through one of the sites).
 We, however, do not guarantee the complete removal of information that may identify a user, particularly in cases where the user has provided that information in comment fields or other fields not specifically designed for the collection of identifiers.</p>
<p>In order to effectively tailor our services, these Sites may sell your personal information third party consultants and business partners, including, but not limited to other lead generation companies (collectively “Third Party Contractors”) to collect, compile, organize, and market to you related services.</p>
<p>When you submit any personal identifiable information on a Site, we will obtain your consent authorizing the Sites to sell to Third Party Contractors, any and all personally identifiable information that is necessary to enable additional service offerings.</p>
<p>Please note that we reserve the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business.
We may also disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities.
We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Sites in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement or other published guidelines.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
SlashDot Media reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion or all of SlashDot Media’s or its affiliated entities’ assets or stock.</p>

Tracking Technologies Pixels <p>We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.
These pixels are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick.
These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/ or you may also opt out by clicking here.</p> Framing <p>The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Site when the user is actually on a third party website.
We also have co-branding relationships with certain partners.
In these relationships, you will notice our service platform on our partner’s page.
In this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected.
We will not share your data with third parties without your consent in these and other relationships.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p> Web beacons <p>We use web beacons from time to time.
A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed.
Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site.
For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image.
Web beacons are not placed on a user’s computer.
Such web beacons may be provided by our third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize any online advertising.</p>
<p>To opt out of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative members, click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</p> Cookies <p>We use cookies on the Sites.
A “browser” or “HTTP” cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user’s browsing program.
We may use browser cookies to personalize a user’s pages at a Site or Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to a Site or across our Sites.
If a user does not want us or our partners to deploy browser cookies in the user’s browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program.
Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites.</p>
<p>We also may use local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies” to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit.
Flash cookies are different from “browser” cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, including how to delete Flash cookies, click here for additional information: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118.</p>
<p>The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google.
The third party advertising technology that we use on the Sites uses information derived from a user’s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites.
In addition, our advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites.
In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser.
Information about users’ visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users’ names, addresses, or other personally identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors.
The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user’s visit to our Sites and other sites on the Internet.
As with other cookies, and consistent with our policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user’s drive or memory.
For more information about Google, Google’s use of cookies, and how to “opt out” of Google’s email/information lists, please click here: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
As noted in the Web Beacon discussion above, users also can opt-out of receiving these types of targeted network advertisements from many advertising networks by clicking here.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.
You will continue to receive generic ads.</p> Log files <p>Our web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user’s IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.
