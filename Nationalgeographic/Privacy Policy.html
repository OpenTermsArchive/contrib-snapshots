Information Collected <b>
<em>Information You Provide Directly to National Geographic</em>
</b>
<br> If you are interested in obtaining information, products or services from National Geographic, or participating in certain activities through the Services, you may need to provide us or our service providers with information about yourself.
For example:<br>
<ul>

<li>If you order a product from us or one of our business partners, you may be asked for your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and your credit card number.</li>
<li>If you are ordering a product as a gift for another person, you may be asked for that person’s name, postal address and phone number in order to enable us to deliver the gift to the recipient.</li>
<li>If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, you may be asked for your name, email address and birth date, and also to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which may be associated with personally identifiable information that has been obtained from or about you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>
<em>Information We May Collect Automatically</em>
</b>
<br> In addition to information you choose to provide to us, National Geographic and our service providers also use standard technologies to automatically collect certain additional information.
For example:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<em>IP Address and Other Identifiers.</em> When you access and interact with our Services, National Geographic and our service providers may collect information about your visits in order to permit you to connect to and obtain the Services and to understand the frequency with which specific visitors visit various parts of our Services.
For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which identifies the computer or service provider that you use to access the Services, or information about your browser type, authentication identifiers, and other software and hardware information.
If you access the Services through a mobile or other device we may collect your mobile device identifier, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.
We may combine this information with other information that we have collected to make our Services and our communications to you more targeted to your interests.</li>
<li>
<em>Social Media Information and Content.</em> If you access or log into a Service through a social media service or connect a Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.
When you access the Services through social media services or when you connect a Service to social media services, you are authorizing National Geographic to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>
<em>Cookies.</em> Our Services may also use cookies.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users.
We and our service providers use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to enhance the quality of our sites.
We use transient (also called “session ID”) cookies to provide continuity from page to page.
A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
We also use persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies allow our online store and certain other parts of our site to recognize your browser when you return after your first visit to that part of our site.
Cookies allow us to personalize your return visits to our site and to save you time during certain activities, such as checking out from our online store.
You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
(Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
It is up to you whether to allow us to send you cookies.
However, if you do not accept cookies from us, your ability to use some aspects of our Services will be limited, such as our shopping cart feature or online games.</li>
<li>
<em>Web beacons and other tracking technologies.</em> The Services may use other tracking tools, including so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "web bugs," "clear GIFs," etc.
(collectively "<b>Web Beacons</b>") to collect user activity information about your activities on the Services.
These are small electronic images embedded in web content (including online ads) and email messages and are ordinarily not visible to users.
Like cookies, Web Beacons enable us to track pages and content (including ads) accessed and viewed by users.
Also, when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to plain text) emails to you, Web Beacons may be embedded in such emails to allow us to monitor readership levels so that we can identify aggregate trends and individual usage to provide our audiences with more relevant content or offers.
Web Beacons in emails may recognize activities such as when an email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in the email were clicked on, etc.
Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page.
However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email.
If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>
<em>Information Contained in User Content</em>
</b>
<br> Some parts of our Services may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials.
If you choose to make personal information public through these Services, National Geographic will consider that information public and will not limit its use or disclosure in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>
<em>Information From Other Sources</em>
</b>
<br> National Geographic and our service providers may supplement the information we collect from and about you with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from NatGeo Affiliates or business partners.<br>
<br>
<b>
<em>Third-Party Online Advertising</em>
</b>
<br> Some of the advertisements you see on the Services are delivered by third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies that collect information about your online activities on this and other websites and apps in an effort to deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
These third parties also may use information about you that we provide, such as your age, gender, or interests, or the features within the Services that you use, to target and serve advertisements to you and to analyze the delivery of advertisements on the Services.
However, we will not provide personal information about you to these companies, except as permitted under this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br> Third parties currently serve ads on our Services, and thereby may collect information about your online activities to deliver tailored ads.
These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes.
These and other third-party companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), which offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from member companies.
To opt out or to obtain information about the technologies member companies use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page.
Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different desktop and mobile web browsers and apps.
To make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page.
You may download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt-out in mobile apps.<br>
<br>
<b>
<em>Do Not Track Signals</em>
</b>
<br> California Law requires us to disclose how we respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘Do Not Track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.<br>
