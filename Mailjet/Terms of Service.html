<p><strong>15. GOVERNING LAW</strong><br />

<p><strong>16. MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>16.1 </strong>Some terms are incorporated into the Agreement by reference to pages on the Mailgun website and Mailgun may revise those terms from time to time (including these Terms of Service). Such revisions will be effective and supersede and form part of the Agreement as of the time (i) you enter into a new Service Order referencing the terms subject to the revisions or (ii) a Service Order automatically renews pursuant to the Agreement in which case you acknowledge that you have reviewed and accept the then-current version of the terms as of the date of the renewal. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Agreement, the documents will govern in the following order: the Service Order, then these Terms of Service. The headings or captions in the Agreement are for convenience only. If over time you enter into multiple Agreements for a given Customer Configuration (for example to add additional components or services) then the most recent terms referenced in the Service Order(s) will govern the entirety of the Services for the given Customer Configuration.</p>
<p><strong>16.2</strong> Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Agreement the terms of the Agreement may be varied only by a written agreement signed by both parties that expressly refers to the Agreement. A Service Order may be amended to modify, add, or remove services by a formal written agreement signed by both parties, or by an exchange of correspondence (including via the Mailgun ticketing system) that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for each of us. The pre-printed terms of your purchase order or other business form or terms that you provide shall be void and of no effect.</p>
<p><strong>16.3</strong> If any part of the Agreement is found unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will continue in effect, and the unenforceable part shall be reformed to the extent possible to make it enforceable and give business efficacy to the Agreement. Each party may enforce its respective rights under the Agreement even if it has waived the right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors and not business partners. Neither party is the agent for the other and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.</p>
