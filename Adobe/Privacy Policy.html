</ul> ADOBE PRIVACY POLICY <p>Effective May 7, 2012</p> What does this privacy policy cover? <p>This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of Adobe’s websites, as well as our products, online services, and apps that include a link to this policy (we refer to our products, online services, and apps as "applications").
This privacy policy also applies to Adobe’s marketing and advertising practices.
Companies acquired by Adobe may operate under their own privacy policies (learn more).
We also provide additional privacy-related information for certain Adobe websites and applications.
Please also see the Adobe Terms of Use and any additional Terms of Use or Product License Agreements that may apply to the website or application you are using. </p> To the top What information does Adobe collect about me? <p>
<b>Adobe ID, registration and customer support</b>
</p>
<p>When you register to use an Adobe website or application, create an Adobe ID, or contact us for support or other offerings, Adobe collects information that identifies you.
This may include your name, company name, email address, or payment information.
We may also sometimes collect other information that does not identify you, such as your job title or industry.
Some of this information is required and other information is optional (more information about what specific Adobe websites and applications collect).
For student and teacher editions of our applications, information regarding your eligibility is required.
To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law.
For example, from these sources, we may learn the company size and industry of our business customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<b>Adobe websites and applications</b>
</p>
<p>We collect information about how you use our websites and applications, including when you use a desktop product feature that takes you online (such as a photo syncing feature).
We may collect information that your browser or device typically sends to our servers whenever you visit an Adobe website, or when an Adobe desktop product feature takes you online.
For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you used.
When you visit an Adobe website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website.
Adobe may collect information about how you use our websites and applications by using cookies and similar technologies, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the website or application.
Depending on the website or application, this information may be anonymous (for example, see the Adobe Product Improvement Program) or it may be associated with you.
