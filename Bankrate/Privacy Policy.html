We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.
Our Services may feature proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research.</p>

When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time.

<p>Phone Numbers<br>
We may collect your phone number in several ways.
For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services.
(ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us.

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br>
We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and usage.
This type of information is not, by itself, personally identifiable information.
But if we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies an individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Log Files, Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers<br>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality, and to document your consent to receiving products, services or communications from us or our partners.
If we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies an individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website (session replay), and to gather various types of information about our user base.

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use cookies to collect and store information.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p>Network Advertising<br>
From time to time, we may participate in, partner with, or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms.
For example, we use Google AdSense to publish ads on our Services.

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices.
In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information.
We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.</p>

</p>
<p>
<u>Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers </u>
<br>
As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a “Request”). <strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.

</p>
<p>
<u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u>
<br>
We may take Your Information and de-identify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information).
We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.</p>

<u>Business Transfers</u>
<br>
We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer.
A “Business Transfer” means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business,<br>
equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any<br>
time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.
