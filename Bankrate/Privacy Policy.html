The purposes for collection and use of this data is that we have a business need to make our website operate efficiently, provide you with different website experiences, and to provide you with ability to save your preferences such as login and preferred language.

Again, please see our Cookie Policy for more information.

<p>
<strong>Cross-Device Tracking</strong>.
We and our service providers may collect and store information about users’ interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies.

The purposes for collection and use of this data are that we have a business need to understand our users’ use of our sites across devices in order to allow users to use our services on one device and pick up seamlessly where they left off on another device. We also have a business need to provide personalized advertising on each device that is inferred from the browsing patterns on all of the devices.</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available sources.</p>
<p>When a Red Ventures company receives or processes personal information on behalf of one of our clients, the client generally determines what information we receive, our purpose in processing the information, and how we will use the information.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<strong>
<u>DATA ANALYTICS</u>
</strong>
<p>We use certain web analytics services, including third-party services such as Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the site.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on both an individual and aggregated basis.
These analytics services, including third-party services such as Google Analytics, also use this information to place advertisements for our products on other websites that you visit after your use of the Site.
These advertisements may be based on the pages you visited during your use of the Site.

</p>
<strong>
<u>USE AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION</u>

These profiles <strong>do not have</strong> legal or similarly significant effects on individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a business need in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our need to conduct our business.</p>
