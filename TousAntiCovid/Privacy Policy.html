			<h1><a href="https://bonjour.tousanticovid.gouv.fr/"><img src="assets/AppIcon.png" class="icon-img"/></a><br/>Personal data</h1>
			
			<h2>"TousAntiCovid" application</h2>
			
			<p>The TousAntiCovid application is part of a comprehensive strategy to fight the Covid-19 epidemic. This application is not mandatory, its use is on a voluntary basis.</p>
			
			<p>The use of the application contributes to the overall strategy of detecting contacts at risk of transmission, the goal of which is to break the chains of transmission of the virus. It allows for faster alerting of contact persons, especially when it comes to contact persons whom infected persons do not necessarily know, such as people encountered on public transport or in shops.</p>
			
			<h3>Data controller and purpose</h3>
			
			<p>The development coordination of which has been entrusted to Inria (Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numérique), which is placed under the responsibility of the Direction générale de la santé du ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé.</p>
			
			<p>The data will be used in order to:</p>
			
			<p>1° Inform a person using the application who has been near at least one other user of the same application who has subsequently been diagnosed positive for the Covid-19 virus, so that there is a risk that it has been contaminated in turn, thanks to a proximity history fed by pseudonyms sent via Bluetooth technology (Robert protocol) or after a scan of the place QR Code (Cléa protocol) ;
			</p>
			
			<p>2° Raise awareness among users of the application on the symptoms of this virus, barrier actions and what to do to fight against the spread of the virus;
			</p>
			
			<p>3° Guide risky contacts with the correct course of actions;</p>
			
			<p>4° Produce statistics in order to adapt the measures necessary to face the epidemic and to improve the performance of the application and the user experience;
			</p>
			
			<p>5° Help to generate supporting documents required by public authorities in the fight against Covid-19 (exceptional travel certificate, for example);
			</p>
			
			<p>6° Obtain health information related to Covid-19 with the possibility of filtering by place of interest;
			</p>
			
			<p>7° Keep certificates of vaccination and negative / positive tests for Covid-19, recovery from Covid-19 and exemption to vaccination;
			</p>
			
			<p>8° Convert 2D-DOC vaccination and negative / positive COVID-19 certificates to digital EU COVID certificates;
			</p>
			
			<p>9° Register during the visit in a defined venue subject to the contact tracing logbook (restaurants, bars, sports halls, etc.), from the "Cahier de rappel" module;
			</p>
			
			<p>10° Inform users of the application of their eligibility for the vaccine booster and of the expiration of their health pass, as part of the activity pass in France, by sending them targeted messages on the basis of the certificates present in the Wallet ;
			</p>
			
			<p>11° Inform users in the event of invalidation of their health pass following the observation of fraudulent use of the health pass by a third person, whether or not the user is aware of it.
			</p>

			<h3>Personal data processed in the TousAntiCovid application</h3>
			
			<p>For the generation of proof of the exceptional travel certificate type, the information entered in this travel certificate generator is not processed by the ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé. This personal data is stored exclusively on the user's mobile phone in order to make it easier for him to complete the next exceptional travel certificate.</p>
			
			<p>To obtain health information related to Covid-19 relating to a place of interest, the information entered is processed locally, on the user's phone, and is not subject to any transfer.</p>
			
			<p>For the storage of the vaccination certificate, negative / positive tests for Covid-19, recovery from Covid-19, exemption to vaccination, the information is processed locally, on the user's phone, and are not subject to any transfer.</p>
			
			<p>For the notification of eligibility for the vaccine booster or the expiration of the health pass (as part of the activity pass in France), the information is processed locally, on the user's phone, and does not make the subject to no transfer.</p>
			
			<p>To fight against fraudulent use of health passes, information is processed locally, on the user's phone, and is not subject to any transfer. This local processing is based on the comparison of a hash of the certificate with those of a reference database hosted by Inria, previously downloaded in the mobile application.</p>
			
			<a id="camera"></a>
			<h4>Using the camera</h4>
			<p>The application may ask the user to authorize the use of his/her mobile phone's camera, when the user wishes to scan a QR Code within the TousAntiCovid application. This authorization will materialize when the user wants to use the QR Code scanning functionality for the first time within the TousAntiCovid application by displaying a dialog box asking the user for authorization to "take photos or videos". No personal data (photo or video belonging to the user) is stored or transmitted by TousAntiCovid, only the content of the QR Code is used as part of the application.</p>

			<h3>Retention period</h3>
				
			<p>For the information of having been near another user positive for Covid-19: the processing is implemented for a period of six months from the end of the state of emergency. Proximity history data will be kept for a maximum of fifteen days from their issuance.
			</p>
			<p>For the exceptional travel certificate: maximum twenty-four hours from the date of validity.</p>

			<p>For the production of statistics: the data used is kept for three months.</p>
			
			<p>For the storage of vaccination certificates and negative / positive tests for Covid-19: certificates can be deleted by the user at any time in the application.</p>
			
			<p>For the conversion of vaccination certificates and negative / positive tests for Covid-19, by IN Groupe: no data is recorded by the central server during the conversion process.</p>
			
			<h3>Exercising your rights</h3>
			
			<p>The rights of access, rectification and limitation cannot be exercised because the data processed are pseudonymized in order to avoid any re-identification of persons. The exercise of these rights would require identification of the data subject, which would considerably weaken the security and confidentiality of the entire application.</p>
						
			<p>However, each user can, at any time, delete data on the mobile application himself. The user can also erase data on the central server by unsubscribing and uninstalling the application.</p>
			
			<p>The user can also at any time exercise his right to object to the development of anonymous statistics by deactivating them from the settings of the TousAntiCovid application.</p>
			
			<p>The user can declare, at any time, the fraudulent use of his health pass by e-mail by writing to revocation-pass-sanitaire@sante.gouv.fr and recover, after confirmation of his/her revocation, his/her new certificate on the site https://sidep.gouv.fr or https://attestation-vaccin.ameli.fr</p>
			
			<p>The user can at any time via the "settings" of the application deactivate the Smart Wallet allowing them to receive targeted health recommendations, in particular on the eligibility for the vaccination booster and the expiration of certificates.</p>
			
			<p>Any questions you may have regarding the processing of your data can be addressed to the Ministry for Health, either by email: <a href="mailto:tousanticovid-rgpd@sante.gouv.fr">tousanticovid-rgpd@sante.gouv.fr</a> or through the post: The Ministry for Social Affairs and Health - Data Protection Officer - General Health Directorate - 14 Avenue Duquesne 75350 Paris 07 SP.</p>
