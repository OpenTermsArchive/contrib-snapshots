			<h1>Personal data</h1>
			<h2>"TousAntiCovid" application</h2>
			
			<p>The TousAntiCovid app is part of the global strategy for tackling the COVID-19 epidemic and helping people to emerge from lockdown. Use of this application is voluntary.</p>
			
			<p>The application:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>notifies users when they have been in contact with another user who has tested positive for COVID-19, drawing on anonymous proximity data collected using Bluetooth </li>
				<li>can be used to generate travel exemption forms</li>
				<li>keeps users up to date with the latest health information linked to COVID-19, with the option of filtering by place of interest</li>
				<li>can be used to seek information on self-isolating</li>
				<li>to keep the certificates of vaccination and negative/positive tests for COVID-19</li>
			</ul> 
			
			<p>The application is part of an overall contact tracing strategy, the goal of which is to break the chain of transmission. It provides a quicker way of notifying contacts, particularly in cases involving individuals who have been infected by people they don’t know, such as on public transport or in shops.</p>
			
			<h3>Data controller and purpose</h3>
			
			<p>This application, the development of which was overseen by Inria, is the responsibility of the General Health Directorate of the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health.
			
			<p>The data will be used in order to:</p>
			
			<p>1° Inform users of the application who have been in proximity to at least one other user who has since tested positive for COVID-19 and who may have been infected themselves</p>
			
			<p>2° Raise awareness among users of the application of the symptoms of the virus, as well as the social distancing measures and behaviours to adopt in order to prevent the virus from spreading </p>
			
			<p>3° Guide at-risk contacts towards competent healthcare professionals for treatment and testing, as the case may be</p>
			
			<p>4° Carrying out anonymous statistics for diagnostic purposes, performance improvement and user experience</p>
			
			<p>5° Generate travel exemption forms</p>
			
			<p>6° Share health information relating to COVID-19, with the option of filtering by place of interest</p>
			
			<p>7° Share guidance on self-isolating in accordance with the selected COVID-19 status</p>
			
			<p>8° Store certificates of vaccination and negative / positive tests for COVID-19</p>
			
			<p>9° Convert former 2D-Doc French digital format to EU Digital COVID-19 certificates</p>
			
			<p>10° Register in restaurants, bars, sports halls in the French it module “Cahier de rappel” for contact tracing purposes</p>
			
			<h3>The legal and regulatory basis for data processing</h3>
			
			<p>This processing is for the purposes of tasks carried out in the public interest (Article 6.1.e of the GDPR) by the General Health Directorate in tackling health threats. There is also a regulatory framework for processing - the decree of 29 May 2020 pertaining to the processing of data entitled “StopCovid" (since renamed TousAntiCovid) introduced after consultation with the CNIL (the French data protection authority).</p>
			
			<h3>Personal data processed on the central server</h3>
			
			<p>For informing people who have been in proximity to other users who have tested positive for COVID-19</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>An authentication key shared by the application and the central server</li>
				<li>For each application that is downloaded, the central server will randomly generate a unique ID. This ID will only be known to the server, where it will be stored</li>
				<li>Country codes</li>
				<li>Random and temporary usernames generated by the server</li> 
				<li>Proximity history</li>
				<li>Periods during which users were exposed to individuals who have been diagnosed with or tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, stored on the central server</li>
				<li>Data entered into the application by individuals who have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and who have chosen to send their at-risk contacts to the proximity history server</li>
				<li>The "contacts at-risk of contamination" status</li>
				<li>The date of the most recent queries on the central server</li>
			</ul>
					
			<p>Part of this data is used for the compilation of anonymous statistics.</p>

			<h3>Personal data processed in the TousAntiCovid application</h3>
			
			<p>For travel exemption forms, no information entered into the travel form generator will be processed by the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health. This personal data will only be stored on individual users’ mobile phones, making it easier for them to fill in their next travel exemption form.</p>
			
			<p>When seeking information on COVID-19 relating to a place of interest, the information that is entered will not be processed by the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health. It will only be stored on individual users’ mobile phones.</p>

			</p>
			
			<p>For the storage of the certificates of vaccination of negative / positive tests for COVID-19, the information entered is not subject to any processing by the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health. They are stored exclusively in the user's mobile phone so that he/she can present them to public authorities.</p>
			
			<a id="camera"></a>
			<h4>Consent to use your smartphone's camera</h4>
			<p>The application requires your consent to use your smartphone's camera, if you wish to scan a QR Code within the TousAntiCovid application. This consent will materialize when you first wish to use this QR Code reading feature within the TousAntiCovid application by displaying a dialog box asking you for permission to "take photos or videos". No personal data (photo or video belonging to you) is stored or transmitted by TousAntiCovid, only the content of the QR Code is used as part of the application.</p>

			<h3>Retention period</h3>
				
			<p>For notifications that you have been in proximity to another user who has tested positive for COVID-19: data will be processed for six months from the declaration of the state of emergency onwards. Proximity history data will be retained for no longer than 2 weeks after being shared.
			</p>
			<p>For travel exemption forms: for a maximum of 24 hours from the validity date onwards.</p>
			
			<p>When seeking information on COVID-19 linked to a place of interest: postcodes will only be recorded in the application, not on the central server. These will be retained until they are modified or deleted by users</p>

			<h3>Exercising your rights</h3>
			
			<p>The right to access and rectify data, as well as purpose limitation, cannot be exercised: data is rendered anonymous in order to prevent users from being identified. Exercising these rights would entail identifying the individual in question, which would considerably weaken both the security and the confidentiality of the application as a whole.</p>
						
			<p>However, users will be able to delete this data from their mobile application at any time. They can also delete any data stored on the central server by unsubscribing and uninstalling the application.</p>
