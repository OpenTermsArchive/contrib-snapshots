 <p> The purpose of the Pandora Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that we collect, how we use that information and the ways listeners can control how that information is used or shared.
The entire policy can be found below.
To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key items.
For information about listeners' obligations and use of Pandora® internet radio, please see our Terms of Use.
</p>
<p> You have significant control over the information that is shared with other Pandora users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile: </p>
<ul>
<li> We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes without your permission.
</li>
<li> Information that you post in our community and through our social networking features is available to members of the public.
</li>
<li> We collect information about the tracks played on Pandora to make sure artists and copyright owners get paid.
We must report listening information to copyright licensing agencies.
These reports contain aggregated data only, and do not identify individual listeners.
</li>
<li> We collect information about the stations, tracks and artists you listen to, thumb-up, thumb-down or bookmark, and the information you provide about yourself, to personalize your Pandora experience through suggestions of music, artists and other content you may enjoy, as well as advertisements and social networking features.
This information is publicly available, unless your profile is marked private.
</li>
<li> Anyone can search for, and listen to, stations that you create on Pandora.
If your profile is private, then other people can find one of your stations in a search, but your profile will not be linked to that station.
however, if someone enters your entire email address into our search system, they will be able to see a list of all the stations created under that email address.
</li>
</ul>
<p> This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the Pandora Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that we collect, how we use and share this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared.
