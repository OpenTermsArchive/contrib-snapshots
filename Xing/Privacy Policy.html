          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">XING is a comprehensive service with various applications</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy"><a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is a service intended through a variety of different applications to improve and simplify users' professional lives. The combination of these applications gives users the best possible user experience and the widest range of functionality. With the boundaries between our professional and private lives becoming ever more intertwined, and correlations occurring between the two, <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is focused not only on a professional context but also includes applications in a private context. <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is particularly interested in opening up new capabilities for users (primarily in a professional context, but also in their private lives), making it easier for them to form horizontal networks, democratising information, fostering the exchange of information, and supporting lifelong learning. In order to fulfil these aims,  <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> makes offers, recommendations and services available to its users, often on the basis of data it has collected, and encourages interaction – both within and beyond a user’s network. The applications that make up the service <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> include, in particular, the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/social-network" class="link-glossar">social network</a> where users can acquire a membership, and a talent acquisition platform.  Some of the <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> applications may appear online under another brand name or in the form of other <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing-websites" class="link-glossar">XING Websites</a> (e.g. onlyfy).<br><br> 
Essentially, <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is a jobs network where professionals from all industries and career levels can find jobs and get found by employers and recruiters. <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> helps its users navigate the many opportunities to find the job that truly suits them and their individual needs. <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is about more than just CVs, it’s about finding the perfect match between talent and the right employer. <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> shows users the career opportunities available to them and empowers them to make informed decisions about their professional job journey.<br><br>
XING’s applications also include recruiting solutions that employers and recruiters can use to identify and attract suitable talent for their organisations. <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> offers a wide range of solutions, ranging from job postings to active sourcing tools and candidate management systems. <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> users, also in the context of this Privacy Policy, are both private individuals (talent) and business users (employers, recruiters). XING’s recruiting solutions are an extension of the <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/soziales-netzwerk" class="link-glossar">social network</a> (making business users members of the <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/soziales-netzwerk" class="link-glossar">social network</a>) or are directly linked to it.
<br><br>
We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you about data processing in connection with the entire service <a href="/de/datenschutzerklaerung/glossar/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> (including all applications). We also provide additional information about data processing for the following applications, which you can access on the respective websites of the applications: </p>

We will inform you once again should we process your personal data for any other purpose, i.e. for a purpose other than the one the personal data was originally saved for. </p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Duty to provide and necessity of personal data for contract closure</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">You are not legally required to make your <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a> available. Nevertheless, in order to close a user contract you must provide information such as your name and e-mail address. Without this information we are not able to enter into such a contract with you. Within the scope of the user contract, we are contractually obliged to keep the data provided in its precise and complete form for all applications used by you and for the entire duration of the contractual term. During the initial process of data entry we inform you if the provision of <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a> is necessary for a particular feature or application ("mandatory field"). Where data is required, any failure to provide this information will result in the respective feature or application not being accessible to you the user. In the case of optional data, not making this information available may mean that our services cannot be provided in the same form or scope. </p>

Here, <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/eu-gdpr" class="link-glossar">EU GDPR</a> terminology is used in favour of FADP terminology.

          <h3 class="data-protection-longversion-h3" data-anchortarget="headline--anchor-2">1. General statement about the purposes of data processing</h3>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">The main reason we process <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a> is to fulfil our contractual obligations towards our users. The processing of data is required, for example, for us to be able to suggest suitable contacts, services and information to you. </p>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Operating a service like <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> is subject to dynamic change by its very nature. It is not therefore possible to share every single detail about our data processing with you, but we do intend to inform you of all the key information. We process data first and foremost in order to fulfil our contractual obligations towards our users. In addition to this, we process your data to preserve our justifiable interests while taking your interests into account  (e.g. when we send you promotional <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/newsletter" class="link-glossar">newsletters</a>). And, of course, in some cases we are legally obliged to process data (e.g. to pass the data on to any investigative authorities). In all other cases we will ask for your separate consent to process your data (e.g. when <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-we-automatically-receive-through-your-use-of-xing/measurement-and-optimisation-of-advertising">using tracking technologies for the measurement and optimisation of advertising</a> or when you enter a prize draw). When it comes to fulfilling our contractual obligations towards our users, we try to tailor our products and services to the needs of users at all times. Personalisation is important here. Interest and usage profiles are created. In order to be able to show you recommendations, e.g. for jobs or contacts, and to suggest you as a valuable business contact or potential employee, we must have an idea of what your interests might be. In order to ascertain these interests we use information that you provide to us, in addition to implicit feedback, i.e. information that we automatically obtain through your usage of our service (by means of so-called "tracking"), as well as information that we may possibly receive indirectly (e.g. through a <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-we-receive-about-you-from-other-sources" class="link-intern">user's address book or upload</a>). In order to meet our contractual obligations, we also serve you third-party advertising tailored to your needs and interests wherever possible. To this end, we provide advertisers with certain targeting criteria. Advertisers can state, for example, that they would like to target "directors" at companies with "1,000-5,000 employees". <br>
If you give us your consent, we will use your data for targeting on third-party platforms (see <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-we-automatically-receive-through-your-use-of-xing/measurement-and-optimisation-of-advertising" class="link-intern">measurement and optimisation of advertising</a>). The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

In the "front end", on your end device, we, or third parties we use, use <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookies</a>, <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/pixel" class="link-glossar">pixels</a>, local storage and similar tracking technologies to collect data about logged-in users and other visitors to enable the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-we-automatically-receive-through-your-use-of-xing/provision-of-our-service" class="link-intern">provision of our service</a> and the analysis of user behaviour, and for the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-we-automatically-receive-through-your-use-of-xing/measurement-and-optimisation-of-advertising" class="link-intern">measurement and optimisation of advertising</a>. In addition, we record your usage behaviour in connection with e-mails we send you, e.g. whether and when you have opened an e-mail, and which links you clicked on. Tracking involves the processing of login data (e.g. date and time of the visit, referrer, IP address, cookie ID, location data, product and version information about the browser or app used, device ID or data) and interaction data (e.g. pages viewed, searches carried out, changes to job application status). In order to be able to identify you as a user during your visit to <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a>, we use so-called session <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookies</a>. These session <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookies</a> are automatically deleted at the end of a session. These <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookies</a> are required to be able to use <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a>. When you register you can choose to remain logged in. If you do, a <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookie</a> is then saved in the browser of your end device that means that you don’t need to log in again for as long as the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookie</a> remains saved. We also conduct a very approximate geo-localisation that informs us of the towns/cities you have been to. In order to do this we use your shorted and anonymised IP address, and your geo-coordinates if you have agreed to this on your mobile end device. We do not save your precise location. We only store information about which cities you are in on a regular basis. Specific addresses or geo-coordinates are not saved. </p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">The purposes of tracking and your opt-out options</h4>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Ensuring security</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">One reason for tracking is to ensure and preserve the legitimate interest of the protection of users, the security of user data, XING Websites, and the XING service. To this end, we save the data we record for up to 12 months in its full form. Only a limited number of our employees with the respective authorisation rights have access to this data. The legal basis for this processing of personal data are Article 6 (1) f) and Article 32 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Provision of our service</h4>

          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We mainly use tracking and the associated user behaviour analysis to meet our contractual obligations and to perform pre-contractual measures. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If tracking is not used to meet our contractual obligations or to perform pre-contractual measures, but to provide the service you visit or use, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To this end, we pursue the legitimate interest of providing you with a smooth and user-friendly service. </p>

          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Tracking and analysing user behaviour helps us to review and optimise the effectiveness of our service, and to identify and correct any errors and faults. To this end, we also use several services from third-party providers, such as Adobe. If we use third-party providers, data may be processed outside of the EU in so-called third countries where the level of data protection applied may not match EU standards. This means there is a risk that authorities in third countries may be able to access third-party provider data, possibly without any means of redress, for monitoring or surveillance purposes. We endeavour at all times to adapt our products and services to the needs of our users. Personalisation is an important aspect here. Analysing data obtained from tracking is necessary to make personalised services available to you in accordance with the contractual purpose of <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> and to ensure that you gain the greatest possible benefit from <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a>. The implicit feedback that you provide to us through our tracking of your usage of <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> forms an important part of understanding what content you are more or less interested in, and being able to suggest you to other users as a valuable business contact or potential employee. This implicit feedback is enormously important as the information you provide to us is reflective of the past and the present for the most part, and says little about what interests you have with regard to the future. Interest profiles produced, for example, with the help of click data or searches you have conducted often form a better basis for estimating whether you, for example, are interested in finding a new job and what type of job openings you might be particularly interested in. When you delete your user account we delete or anonymise the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a> we have obtained through tracking in order to provide our service. </p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Examples</h4>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Clickpath</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">One important feature to result from our analyses is, for example, the provision of the "Clickpath". This is an essential part of contact management and as such an essential feature of XING. Clickpath is a function of the service XING which registers access to users’ profiles by other users, as well as to event pages, Business Pages, Employer Branding Profiles, job ads, or access to specific information contained therein. The information registered by Clickpath is only available to Premium members, users who post job ads, operators of Business Pages and Employer Branding Profiles, and organisers who have booked the Event Plus option for their events. By using Clickpath you can see, as a Premium member, e.g. which other users have visited your <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/profile" class="link-glossar">profile</a>. By the same token, all other Premium members can do the same, i.e. they may see whether you have visited their profile, event page, Business Page, Employer Branding Profile or job ad. You are not able to deactivate this feature in your privacy settings. If you do not agree that other users may see that you have visited their profile, Business Page, etc., you should refrain from using the service XING. This information about other users also applies to users who are not logged in but have been identified by XING using cookies and e-mail tokens. This function ensures a seamless and personalised user experience, ranging from XING newsletters to the XING platform, without compromising user security.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Recommendations</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Another important feature resulting from our analyses are recommendations that we tailor to you personally on the basis of your user data. We can, for example, recommend job offers, relevant news or interesting contacts to you.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Personal statistics</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">In order to be able to identify you as a valuable business contact or potential employee, we may show other users information about your personal <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> usage. This may include, for example, an assessment of your profile’s up-to-dateness, your activity index, the number of similarities with any of your individual <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/profile" class="link-glossar">profile</a> visitors, the number of profile views, or the start date and the type of your membership.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">You can opt out of tracking by the following third-party providers:</h4>
          
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Adobe Digital Analytics</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We use the tracking tool Adobe Digital Analytics. Whenever you are logged in as a user on <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> your data is matched with your user ID during the tracking process. If you are not logged in as a user, tracking is pseudonymous, i.e. we are not able to directly deduce information regarding your identity from information we obtain from tracking. The <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookies</a> used for the web analysis contain an ID which allows us to identify your end device’s browser. We have closed a data processing agreement with the provider and your IP addresses are anonymised immediately after collection.</p>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">You can opt out of tracking by Adobe Digital Analytics at any time, simply by clicking on the following link and opting to exclude yourself from visitor session aggregation and analysis: <br><br>xing.com: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.xing.com/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.xing.com/adobe.html</a><br>1. onlyfy.io: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.onlyfy.io/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.onlyfy.io/adobe.html</a><br>2. onlyfy.jobs: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.onlyfy.jobs/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.onlyfy.jobs/adobe.html</a><br>anschreiben.com: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.anschreiben.com/adobe.html " class="link-extern">https://stan.anschreiben.com/adobe.html </a><br>bewerbung.com: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.bewerbung.com/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.bewerbung.com/adobe.html</a><br>lebenslauf.com: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.lebenslauf.com/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.lebenslauf.com/adobe.html</a><br>new-work.se: <a data-actionname="settings_adobe_optoutlink_click" target="_blank" href="https://stan.new-work.se/adobe.html" class="link-extern">https://stan.new-work.se/adobe.html</a><br><br> Please note that this opt-out option installs a <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/cookies" class="link-glossar">cookie</a> on the end device you’re using when you click on the link.

          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Braze</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We use the 'Braze' service to collect your usage of some parts of the platform to be able to serve you personal tips and information.<br><br>You can enable or deactivate this data collection. We recommend you enable it so we can provide you with useful tips and information (e.g. about updates to the features you use, or current billing information).</p>

          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Measurement and optimisation of advertising</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">With your permission, we and third-party providers we commission will use cookies, device identifiers or other information saved or viewed on your device (tracking) and your data (see also <a href="/en/privacy-policy/information-you-provide-us-with/">information you provide us with</a>) to measure the success of advertising campaigns, to build up a profile of your interests, and to serve you relevant ads based on this profile. If you opt in, a cookie is set on your end device that enables us to recognise you on XING web pages even if you’re not logged in. The cookies have a lifespan of up to 2 years.<br> In this context, the servers of third-party providers (e.g. marketers) might be accessed directly when using XING. Here, the respective third-party provider may record the fact that you visited our website(s). In addition, such site visits may lead to information being sent to some of these third-party providers with the aim of optimising and measuring the performance of our advertising. This includes, for example, information about the kind of pages you visited, or encoded user attributes such as you belonging to a certain target audience we have defined (e.g. that you are a XING member). Calling third-party provider servers directly allows third-party providers to use cookies and advertising IDs for retargeting purposes. Retargeting technologies enables third-party providers to show you personalised advertising based on your previous browsing behaviour on partner websites. Third-party providers are, to some extent, able to link your various technical IDs and thus show you personalised advertising across multiple devices. Third-party providers such as Xandr or The AdEx enable us to offer advertising campaigns outside of XING so that advertisers can also promote their products and services on and outside of XING based on targeting criteria we supply to advertisers. To ensure maximum protection of your data, we use a complex hashing algorithm which encrypts your information stored in the cookie. To measure and evaluate an advertising campaign's performance, we may send the third-party provider randomly generated click IDs which enable us to assign user conversions to a certain campaign.<br> 
In addition, an advertising partner can also send us their randomly generated user ID which may be linked to a XING user ID. By linking these technical IDs, we can identify users and provide advertising partners with information such as whether a user is a registered XING user. This may also include information such as an IP address or device IDs (e.g. a combination of browser version and operating system). The aforementioned link serving to transfer information between our website and third-party providers, be it for conversion measurement or as remarketing technology, is generally provided in the form of a pixel or other similar technology. <br>
When remarketing on third-party-provider platforms such as Google, we also create custom audiences on these third-party platforms (e.g. Google Customer Match or Facebook Custom Audiences). These custom audience features (e.g. from Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Facebook) are designed to serve users with targeted advertising based on their interests when visiting the respective third-party platform (e.g. Facebook or some other Meta platform). In addition to cookies and technical IDs, we use hashed information such as your e-mail address or phone number along with the aforementioned encoded user attributes and other technical IDs to create custom audiences. Custom audience data is only supplied to respective third-party providers such as Meta in highly hashed form. To recognise repeat visitors to their platform, third-party providers apply the same method to hash their users' e-mail addresses and phone numbers. Better user identification means better use of targeting technologies and matching job offers for you in ads. <br>
Third-party providers are solely responsible for operating their IT systems in line with applicable data-protection practices and law. Third-party providers are responsible for deciding how long data is stored for. If we use third-party providers, data may be processed outside of the EU in so-called third countries where the level of data protection applied may not match EU standards. This means there is a risk that authorities in third countries may be able to access third-party provider data, possibly without any means of redress, for monitoring or surveillance purposes. To ensure an appropriate level of protection, we use the EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCCs) on a regular basis.<br><br>Tracking and processing of your data as described here are based on your consent, see Section 25 (1) of the New German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG) and Article 6 (1) a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Along with our protective measures, data processing in third countries is based on your consent, see Article 49 (1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time. </p>

          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data from LinkedIn Profile Import (LinkedIn Member Portability API)</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">This includes data that can be retrieved from your LinkedIn profile via a data portability interface (LinkedIn Member Data Portability API), such as:</p> 
          <ul class="list data-protection-topic__list">
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Given name and surname</li>
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Email address</li>

            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Your job preferences: for instance, preferred job types, locations, industries, company size, title, activity level</li>
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Jobs you have saved to view them later</li>
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Job notifications you have activated (including date, URL, etc)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Purpose</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">By means of the LinkedIn import function, we enable you to automatically fill in your profile with any relevant profile data from your LinkedIn profile. This makes it easier to create or update a profile, and it helps avoid redundant data entries. In this way, you can quickly and consistently complete your profile using existing information. If we permanently store the transferred data in your profile as a part of this function, we will provide you with appropriate tools to manage (edit or delete) this information. You can stop the aforementioned processing of your personal data anytime, for instance, by deleting the imported information or deactivating LinkedIn integration.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data source</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">The data originates from your LinkedIn profile, which you will explicitly share to XING as a part of the import process via LinkedIn (authentication and data release via LinkedIn OAuth interface).</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Visibility</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Upon completion of the import, the imported profile information is subject to the same visibility rules as other profile data on XING. This information is visible to other XING members and, depending on your settings, to non-members (e.g. via public search engines), depending on your privacy settings. No further disclosure to third parties beyond XING takes place, and in particular, no profile data will be transferred back to LinkedIn.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data retention period</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">As the imported LinkedIn data become a part of your profile, we will generally retain them until you either delete the information from your profile or delete your user account entirely. If you disconnect LinkedIn connection in your account settings or revoke access to your LinkedIn profile, no further updates or data transfers from LinkedIn will take place. Be reassured that you will be able to edit or delete data you have already transferred to your profile anytime.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Ongoing updates (Changelog API)</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">As long as your OAuth token is valid, XING can use the LinkedIn Changelog API to check if your LinkedIn profile data has changed.</p>
          <ul class="list data-protection-topic__list">
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Any changes will be displayed to you.</li>
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">There is no automated data transfer to your profile. In every instance, you decide for yourself whether and which information should be transferred</li>
            <li class="list-item data-protection-topic__listitem">Once the token expires or is revoked, XING will no longer retrieve any further updates.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Legal basis</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(b) EU GDPR and/or Article 6(1)(a) EU GDPR, as the retrieval and transfer of profile information is carried out at your request</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data concerning the up-to-dateness of your profile compared to your LinkedIn profile</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">This includes information or an assessment of whether the data in your profile are up to date in comparison with your LinkedIn profile. Specifically, this consists of your XING profile URL and an indication of whether your LinkedIn profile is equally, less, or more up to date. No further data will be processed in this context.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Purpose</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Correct and up-to-date profile information is essential for XING and the fulfillment of the service agreement. To this end, we request the aforementioned information on your profile on a regular basis. We therefore aim to assess whether your profile is up to date, including in order to offer you, where applicable, options to update and maintain your profile (for example, by means of a LinkedIn profile import).</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data source</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We receive the aforementioned data from a service provider.</p>

          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We retain this information until you delete your user account.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Legal basis</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) of the EU GDPR. Among other things, we pursue the legitimate interest of assessing whether the information in your profile is accurate and complete in accordance with the requirements set out in the XING Terms of Use. Furthermore, we pursue the legitimate interest of other users in obtaining clarity as to whether the information in your profile is accurate and complete.</p>

          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Data from address book or list uploads</h4>

We review each of these service providers beforehand with regard to the measures they have undertaken to ensure data protection and data security, thereby safeguarding the contractual provisions as stipulated by law for the protection of the <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a>.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Other users</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">Other users means any users of the comprehensive XING service and all its applications (XING, onlyfy, etc.). Other users can also include companies and their authorised users that use an application which is part of the XING service (business user).

Separate privacy settings are available to you here. If you opt not to restrict these settings, the information in your <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/profile" class="link-glossar">profile</a> will be visible and accessible to non-users, although this does not include any personal contact details such as e-mail addresses and phone numbers. <br> The standard external accessibility of profile information by non-users forms a central element of <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> as a way of fostering networking between users, as many business contacts are made in the first instance when other users (or third parties) find the name of a user when conducting research in search engines.<br> With some features on <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> another user determines whether and to what extent the data used or shared for a particular function is visible or accessible to other users and non-users, and who is authorised to read this content and add to this content. If you aren’t able to change these settings through your own privacy settings, we will inform you about the respective use of your data in the respective feature.</p>
          <h4 class="data-protection-longversion-h4">Selected developers and companies ("API Partners")</h4>
          <p class="data-protection-topic__copy">We provide the XING API to selected developers and companies ("API Partners") so that they can develop and manage applications that grant users of API Partner applications access to data and content beyond <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> while also allowing said users to integrate external content on <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a>. The aim of integrating external applications is to make <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> more appealing and useful to users. API stands for Application Programming Interface, meaning that the XING API is an interface provided by us that allows API partners to integrate one or more applications on <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/xing" class="link-glossar">XING</a> provided they adhere to our contractual terms. <br>
Users wishing to use an API Partner application must grant the application access to data; an API application of an API Partner can therefore only ever access data with the express allowance of the user. Depending on the application in question, a separate declaration of consent for data processing may be required. When API Partners process XING user data, this is performed on behalf of the user that activated the application.<br> 
Every API Partner application that accesses the data and content of users requires our prior consent. XING has therefore compiled a list of criteria in order to ensure that the data of users is safe and secure.<br> 
If an application involves personal data being processed in countries outside of the European Union, we will stipulate the legal privacy provisions required in order to ensure that API Partners maintain an appropriate level of protection for <a href="/en/privacy-policy/glossary/personal-data" class="link-glossar">personal data</a>.</p>

Your payment details will be transferred, to the extent needed, along with other required data for processing the transaction, including invoicing and debt collection where applicable, to providers such as credit card institutes, payment providers and debt collection providers, and processed there, or the data will be collected directly by these providers. <br>
