                        <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.</p>

                        <p>We do not “sell” the personal information of our organizers or users of the Services as the term “sale” or “sell” is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”). That means we do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information in exchange for money or something else of value.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the rights described in our Privacy Policy above, California law grants California residents certain rights as set forth below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Notice.</strong> You have a right to be provided with a notice at minimum of the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which it is used at or before the points of collection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination.</strong> The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA, such as by denying or providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or charging different prices or imposing penalties on residents who exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the residents’ data.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Submitting Requests</strong></p>

Please be prepared to provide your first and last name and email address that matches information we currently have on file. Where we are unable to verify your identity based upon this information alone, we may require additional details.

                        <p><strong>California Shine the Light Law</strong></p>
                        <p>Under California’s Shine the Light law, California residents who provide us certain personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any, and as defined under the law) that we have shared with third parties during the preceding calendar year for their own direct marketing purposes.
