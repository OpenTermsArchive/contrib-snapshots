This Privacy Policy was last modified on April 20, 2012.
Our Privacy Policy We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide to us and to our clients, advertisers, and affiliates (collectively “Affiliates”) in connection with your use of the websites, services, products, and software applications owned, managed or provided to you by us (the "Sites").
We created this Privacy Policy to help you understand what information we collect (whether personally identifiable or not), how we collect it, how we use it, how we share it, how we protect it, and how you can control it.
If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date above and post the changes here.
Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites, products and services.
This privacy policy only applies to our Sites and our collection and use of your information.
The linked websites, products and services of third parties, and their collection and use of your information, are governed by the privacy policies of such third parties.
We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
1.
Information We Collect  We do not require you to provide us with personally identifiable information in order to use our Sites.
However, if you choose to participate in certain activities offered on the Sites (such as surveys and grocery list building and sharing), we may ask you to provide us with what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, and home/mobile telephone number, etc.
).
In addition, you may have the option of providing us with certain demographic information about yourself or your household (such as age, gender, household income, interests, zip code, and state).
There may be other occasions not specifically identified in this Privacy Policy when we may ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information.
However, it will always be your decision whether to provide us with your personally identifiable information.
In some cases, if you decline to share such information with us, then we may not be able to provide you with certain services.
There are different ways in which we may collect information when you interact with our Sites.
  Many are discussed below, but in general we may collect information when you: View, print, download, save, and/or display coupons.
Redeem coupons.
Register with us or our Affiliates.
Use our Sites to create and sync shopping lists.
Interact with advertisements on our Sites.
Communicate with our customer service team for support.
Participate in certain programs, offers, and promotions.
Use our referral service to tell your friend(s) about our coupons.
Invite others to share your shopping list.
Register a retailer loyalty account or similar retailer identifier with us.
Register or interact with us via Facebook Connect or other social media provider.
Additionally, when you download and install our coupon printing software, toolbar, or mobile applications on your computer or other device, we collect information about that device that helps us manage our products and services and detect and prevent coupon fraud.
Instructions on uninstalling our toolbar and our coupon printer software are available here.
A device identifier stays on your computer even after uninstalling the coupon printer software.
This identifier is used solely to prevent coupon fraud and does not collect personally identifiable information.
Cookie &amp; Web Beacon Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites.
These persistent cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different.
Please review your browser’s Help menu to learn how to modify your cookies setup.
Our Sites also use web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are placed in the code of a webpage.
Affiliate Cookies: Cookies sent to your computer by us, or our Affiliates on our behalf, are governed by this Privacy Policy.
The independent use of cookies by our Affiliates is not covered by this privacy policy, as we do not have access or control over such cookies.
  Generally speaking, such cookies are used by Affiliates to provide you with customized advertising.
To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, please consult your browser's help menu.
Automatically Collected Information: When you use the Sites or open one of our emails, we use technology (including web beacons and cookies, IP addresses, unique device IDs, user IDs, and log files) to automatically collect non-personally identifiable information including: Coupon activity (including requesting, printing, and saving to a loyalty account).
Application activity (such as searches performed and features accessed).
Web browser type.
The website that referred you to us.
The web pages you viewed on the Sites.
The advertisements you viewed and clicked on the Sites.
The dates and times that you visited the Sites.
We may link automatically collected information to personally identifiable information you submit while on the Sites when you are logged in or in connection with a service you have requested.
For example, if you sign up for our Grocery iQ application, we will store your user ID together with your email address so that you can manage and (if you chose to) share your shopping list.
Tell-A-Friend: If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our coupons, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.
We will use the information you provide to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to view the coupon you recommended.
We delete the email address shortly after fulfilling your request and do not share it with any third party.
Lists &amp; List Sharing: If you use our Grocery iQ mobile application, or our Grocery iQ website, we will collect and store for you the items you put on your list.
We also may use that information to serve you tailored advertising, coupons or other content.
For instance, if your list includes baby food, we may present you with a coupon or advertisement from us or an Affiliate for baby food or related items, such as diapers.
If you choose to invite someone to share your shopping list, we will ask you to provide us with that person’s email address in order to send them your invitation.
We store this information in order to administer the list sharing feature, but we do not share it with any third party.
  Location Information: Use of the Sites, including our mobile applications, may include location-based services.
If you use those services, we may receive information about your location which we may use to send you geographically relevant promotions or advertisements.
Analytic Tools: We may use tools such as Google Analytics to better understand who is using our Sites and how they are using them.
These tools use cookies to collect information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used.
We use this information to manage and improve our Sites.
You can learn how to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking software here.
Promotions, Sweepstakes, &amp; Contests: From time to time, we may sponsor sweepstakes, contests, other promotions or surveys.
Personal information may be required as a condition of participation for purposes of verifying entrants' identities, notifying winners and fulfilling prizes.
We will not use or disclose any such information unless we receive your consent to do so.
If we engage a third party to assist us in administering a promotion or fulfilling prizes, this information will be disclosed to that third party.
Data Retention: We retain all information we collect about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

How We Use Your Information We use all of the information that we collect from your use of the Sites, any information you provide when you register with us, and information provided to us by third parties as described below.
  The following are the ways we use information we collect: Operate, maintain, deliver, and communicate with you about the coupons, advertisements, content, and promotional offerings found on the Sites.

  Back to top 3.
When We Share Information Personally Identifiable Information: We do not share personally identifiable information with our Affiliates or other third-parties for their marketing or promotional uses except as part of a specific program or feature that you have chosen to participate in.
For example, we offer coupons on our Sites that require you to fill out an advertiser survey in order to receive the coupon.
If you choose to participate in the survey, then we will share the information you provide with the advertiser who provided the survey.
You may be given the option to register with the website of one of our Affiliates, or sign up for an Affiliate’s newsletter.
If we manage the website for the Affiliate and you choose to register or sign up with that Affiliate, then we will share the information you provide with that Affiliate.
In addition, we may use your personally identifiable information for the purpose of obtaining associated non-personally identifiable information from third parties, but we do not permit those third parties to use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with associated non-personally identifiable information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We aggregate non-personally identifiable information (such as age, gender, household income, interests, zip code, state, coupon print and redemption data, and other automatically collected information that does not personally identify you) and share such aggregated information with our Affiliates in order to help them improve the marketing of their products and services.
We may also share such non-personally identifiable information with our Affiliates when you interact with our promotional content on their websites.
An Affiliate may match the non-personally identifiable information we provide with personally identifiable information you have previously provided to that Affiliate.
For instance, if you have signed up for a loyalty account from one of our Affiliates, such as a grocery retailer, and request that our coupon be saved to that loyalty account, we will provide the Affiliate with the coupon and other information necessary to fulfill your request.
The Affiliate will then match the information with your loyalty account which may contain your personally identifiable information.
We also may share such non-personally identifiable information with third-party ad servers, ad networks, and data exchanges (“Ad Partners”) so that they can tailor their advertisements to your apparent interests and deliver those advertisements to you while you are either on our Sites or on third-party websites.
For example, if you print pet food coupons, then an Ad Server may conclude that you have a pet and display a pet care supply advertisement instead of a random advertisement.
In addition, Ad Partners themselves use technologies (such as cookies, pixels, and beacons) to collect information about your browsing behavior on our Sites which they may match with information they have previously collected (including personally identifiable information you have provided to them).
However, we do not share personally identifiable information with Ad Partners, and we do not permit Ad Partners to collect personally identifiable information about you on our Sites.

Exceptions: We may share information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local, state, or federal laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other governmental subpoena or warrant, or in the event of bankruptcy proceedings.
We also reserve the right to share information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability, protect us or our Affiliates from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, protect the security or integrity of the Sites, and to protect our rights, property, or safety and those of our Affiliates and others.
  In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
