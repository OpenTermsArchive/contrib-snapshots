    <h1>Couchsurfing.com Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date:&nbsp;October <b>14, 2023</b></p>
    <p>Please read this Global Privacy Policy (&ldquo;<b>Privacy Policy</b>&rdquo;) carefully to get a clear
      understanding of how Couchsurfing International, Inc. (&ldquo;<b>Couchsurfing</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>we</b>,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;<b>us</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<b>our</b>&rdquo;) collects, uses, discloses, protects and otherwise handles
      information about you. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local
      practices and legal requirements. In this Privacy Policy, we also provide a supplementary privacy notice for
      <a href="#NoticetoCAResidents">California residents</a> and a supplementary privacy  notice for data subjects in 
      the <a href="#NoticeToEuropeanDataSubjects">EEA, Switzerland and the UK (collectively, &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;)</a>.</p>
    <h3>About Couchsurfing</h3>
    <p>Couchsurfing provides a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in
      activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing connects travelers with a global network of people
      willing to share in profound and meaningful ways, making travel a truly social experience. We are a community
      built on trust. A fundamental part of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and
      protect your right to privacy. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the information we collect about you,</li>
      <li>how we use and share that information, and</li>
      <li>the privacy choices available to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites (&ldquo;<b>Site</b>&rdquo;),
      mobile application (&ldquo;<b>App</b>&rdquo;) and other online products and services (collectively, the
      &ldquo;<b>Services</b>&rdquo;), or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this
      Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the App and the
      Site. If required by law, we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is
      reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the App or the Site. We encourage you
      to review the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help
      protect your privacy. </p>
    <h3><a id="WhatInformationDoWeCollect">What Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Services?</a></h3>
    <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
    <p>We collect information you provide to us, such as when you create an account, verify your identity, update your 
       profile, use the interactive features of our Services, participate in contests, promotions or surveys, request 
       customer support or otherwise communicate with us. </p>
    <p>The types of information we may collect include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Account information</b>, such as your name, username, gender, birth date, email address, mailing address,
        city, country, postal code, billing address, phone number and profile picture;</li>
      <li><b>Communications </b>that we exchange with users when they contact us with questions or feedback, including
        feedback about interacting with other users, and messages and interactive forum information, such as discussion
        group posts, messages to other Couchsurfing users and information you provide in connection with activities and
        events;</li>
      <li><b>Other background, contact and demographic information</b>, such as your occupation, personal URL, IM
        username, emergency contact, home descriptions, travel history and plans and other interests and
        self-descriptions you choose to provide;</li>
      <li><b>Payment and transactional data</b> when you pay for our Services, including name, payment card information,
        bank account number, billing information, and your transaction history. This information is collected and
        processed by our payment providers, Stripe, PayPal&nbsp;&nbsp;, Google and Apple, and we do not have access to
        payment card numbers. In addition to this Privacy Policy and our <a
          href="https://about.couchsurfing.com/about/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, information related to your
        payments or purchases is also processed according to Stripe&rsquo;s, PayPal&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s, and
        Apple&rsquo;s service agreements and privacy policies.</li>
      <li><b>Information stored on your mobile device (if you have given us permission to access this information)</b>,
        such as your photos, calendar information and your contacts&rsquo; name, phone numbers and image thumbnail (if
        available). In particular, to help users connect with people they know, we offer them the option to invite
        friends to join them on Couchsurfing. To take advantage of this feature, users can opt in to share phone numbers
        from their address book or add phone numbers manually.</li>
      <li><b>Identity verification and biometric information, if you elect to use the identity verification service</b>.
        If you choose to verify your identity when using the Services, we will ask you to provide a photo of your 
        government-issued ID as well as a selfie to our biometric verification service provider Onfido. Onfido collects, 
        uses, and stores facial geometry extracted from the selfie and the ID to confirm that the two facial images 
        match. This match enables Onfido to verify the user’s identity. Onfido also processes this data as an 
        independent controller to improve its facial recognition technology. Couchsurfing does not retain the facial 
        geometry derived from your ID image and selfie, and we require Onfido to delete this facial geometry after 
        your identity has been verified. For more information, please also see 
        <a href="https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/" target="_blank">Onfido’s Facial Scan Policy</a>, 
        <a href="https://onfido.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and 
        <a href="https://onfido.com/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
    </ul>

        improve our Services and your experience, monitor user activity, count visits, understand usage and campaign
        effectiveness, and tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h4>

      that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you link, connect, or login to the Services
      through a third-party social networking site, you direct that third-party service to send us information such as
      your name, connections, email address, birthday, gender, location and other account information in accordance with

      your privacy settings at that service.</p>

    <p>Couchsurfing has users located across the globe. We may store and process personal information in the United
      States and other countries, which may not have the same data protection laws as your home country or territory.
      However, wherever we store your information we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as
      otherwise disclosed to you. Please note, while Couchsurfing is certified under the EU.-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S.
      Privacy Shield frameworks, following the invalidation of such frameworks we no longer rely on Privacy Shield for
      our cross-border data transfers. However, we continue to comply with the frameworks. Please read the information
      below, which we provide in accordance with the Privacy Shield Notice Principle.</p>
    <p>Couchsurfing International Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy
      Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
      personal information transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States,
      respectively. Couchsurfing International Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
      Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy
      Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and
      to view our certification, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"
        target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
    <p>To the extent required by the Privacy Shield principles or applicable law, you have the opportunity to choose 
      (opt out) whether your personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party or (ii) to be used for a 
      purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently 
      authorized by you.  For more information about the choices you have in relation to your personal information, 
      visit the <a href="#YourInformationChoices">&ldquo;Your Information Choices&rdquo;</a>, and to exercise your rights

      of your personal information. Individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should

      we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free
      of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" 
          target="_blank">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>. Note, you may have the possibility, 
      under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not 
      resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms. For more information about invoking binding arbitration, 
      please review additional information here. Couchsurfing is responsible and liable if third-party agents that it 
      uses to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, 
      unless Couchsurfing proves that it is not responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur.</p>
    <p>We are subject to investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with respect to 
      personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework</p>

      <li><b>Social Media Tools</b>. Couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which let

      Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;<b>CCPA</b>&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The CCPA grants California residents the following rights:</p>

      sensitive information and other consumers&rsquo; personal information, and may exclude information that would
      compromise the confidentiality of trade secrets. The CCPA also places limits on when companies must comply with a
      deletion request.</p>

      we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
      use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can

        We may retain your personal data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and
        prevention, and enhancing trust and safety. For example, if we suspend a Couchsurfing account for fraud or
        safety reasons, we may retain information from that account to prevent that member from opening a new account in
        the future.</li>
      <li><b>Objection. </b>You may have the right to object to how we use your personal data.</li>
      <li><b>Restrict Processing. </b>You may ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data, for example, if

      <li><b>Data Portability.</b> If required to do so, we will give you your personal data in a structured, commonly
        used, and machine-readable format.</li>
