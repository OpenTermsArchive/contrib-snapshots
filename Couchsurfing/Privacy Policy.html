    <p>Effective Date:&nbsp;November <b>1, 2021</b></p>
    <p>Please read this Global Privacy Policy (&ldquo;<b>Privacy Policy</b>&rdquo;) carefully to get a clear
      understanding of how Couchsurfing International, Inc. (&ldquo;<b>Couchsurfing</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>we</b>,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;<b>us</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<b>our</b>&rdquo;) collects, uses, discloses, protects and otherwise handles
      information about you. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local
      practices and legal requirements. In this Privacy Policy, we also provide a supplementary privacy notice for
      <a href="#NoticetoCAResidents">California residents</a> and a supplementary privacy  notice for data subjects in

    <h3>About Couchsurfing</h3>
    <p>Couchsurfing provides a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in
      activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing connects travelers with a global network of people
      willing to share in profound and meaningful ways, making travel a truly social experience. We are a community
      built on trust. A fundamental part of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and
      protect your right to privacy. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the information we collect about you,</li>
      <li>how we use and share that information, and</li>
      <li>the privacy choices available to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites (&ldquo;<b>Site</b>&rdquo;),
      mobile application (&ldquo;<b>App</b>&rdquo;) and other online products and services (collectively, the

    <p>From time to time, we may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this
      Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the App and the
      Site. If required by law, we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is
      reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the App or the Site. We encourage you
      to review the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help
      protect your privacy. </p>

    <p>Couchsurfing has users located across the globe. We may store and process personal information in the United
      States and other countries, which may not have the same data protection laws as your home country or territory.
      However, wherever we store your information we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as
      otherwise disclosed to you. Please note, while Couchsurfing is certified under the EU.-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S.

      below, which we provide in accordance with the Privacy Shield Notice Principle.</p>
    <p>Couchsurfing International Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy
      Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of

      respectively. Couchsurfing International Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
      Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy
      Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and

        target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
    <p>To the extent required by the Privacy Shield principles or applicable law, you have the opportunity to choose 
      (opt out) whether your personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party or (ii) to be used for a 
      purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently 
      authorized by you.  For more information about the choices you have in relation to your personal information, 
      visit the <a href="#YourInformationChoices">&ldquo;Your Information Choices&rdquo;</a>, and to exercise your rights

      unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based 
      third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" 
      target="_blank">here</a>.  Note, you may have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding

      mechanisms. For more information about invoking binding arbitration, please review additional information

      Couchsurfing is responsible and liable if third-party agents that it uses to process  the personal data on its 
      behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Couchsurfing proves that it is not 
      responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur.</p>
    <p>We are subject to investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with respect to 
      personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework</p>

    <h3><a name=NoticetoCAResidents>Notice To California Residents</a></h3>
    <p>We are providing this supplemental privacy notice to Consumers in California, pursuant to the California Consumer
      Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;<b>CCPA</b>&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The CCPA grants California residents the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Information</b>.Our Privacy Policy describes how we use and share your personal information through the
        Services, including during the past 12 months. The Policy describes:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sources through which we collect California residents&rsquo; personal information and
      the types of personal information collected in the <a href="#WhatInformationDoWeCollect">What Information Do We
        Collect When You Use Our Services?</a> section above.</p>
    <p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purposes for which we use and share this information in the <a

    <p>The CCPA limits these rights. For example, companies may not provide users in response to access requests certain
      sensitive information and other consumers&rsquo; personal information, and may exclude information that would
      compromise the confidentiality of trade secrets. The CCPA also places limits on when companies must comply with a
      deletion request.</p>

    <p>Here is how you can submit requests:</p>
    <ul>

        requests on their behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in
        accordance with the CCPA.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Retention of Data</b>. We keep your personal data for as long as you have a Couchsurfing account. To protect
      the safety and security of our users, your personal data will be retained for a reasonable period of time
      following account deletion or deactivation. To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data,
      we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
      use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can
      achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We may delete the data by
      anonymizing it so it can no longer be associated with a user.</p>
    <p><a><b>Storage</b></a>. We are based in the United States and rely on cloud storage providers that store user data
      on our behalf in the United States.&nbsp;The United States may have data protection laws less stringent than or
      otherwise different from the laws in effect in Europe. We have taken measures to protect the confidentiality and
      security of your personal data, and your rights as a data subject.</p>
    <p><a><b>Your Rights</b></a>. The GDPR grants European data subjects the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Access.</b> You can request a copy of the personal data that we maintain about you. If you require
        additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.</li>
      <li><b>Deletion and Correction. </b>You can ask us to delete or correct the personal data that we hold about you.
        We may retain your personal data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and
        prevention, and enhancing trust and safety. For example, if we suspend a Couchsurfing account for fraud or
        safety reasons, we may retain information from that account to prevent that member from opening a new account in
        the future.</li>
      <li><b>Objection. </b>You may have the right to object to how we use your personal data.</li>
      <li><b>Restrict Processing. </b>You may ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data, for example, if
        you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
      <li><b>Data Portability.</b> If required to do so, we will give you your personal data in a structured, commonly
        used, and machine-readable format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@couchsurfing.com">privacy@couchsurfing.com</a>.
      You may also contact our representative using the contact information referenced in the <a
