<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to provide consumers with clear and complete information about the consumer data we collect in connection with our Services and the way that data is stored and used by our company, our clients and partners.
For information about our privacy practices as they relate to our corporate website, please see below.</p> Information We Collect <p>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services<br>We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a multitude of Digital Content Provider properties.
When you visit one of these properties, our automated system may collect "click stream data" related to your visit to the property.
Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, content or pages viewed, the date and time at which that content was viewed and any interaction with content and advertisements on those properties.
Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.</p>
<p>In order to improve performance, we augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Digital Content Providers and other partners.
This anonymous data may include such things as postal code, age and gender.
It may also include GPS location provided by Digital Content Providers with mobile properties.</p>

In registering for the service, you may choose to provide personally identifiable information such as your name and/or email address.
Exponential will not merge any of this Tech Bargains personally identifiable information with any non-personally identifiable information collected by our systems (including systems for all other Exponential divisions) and will not use this personally identifiable information in any way that is not authorized by the user from whom it is collected.
In addition, we keep this data in a separate database to ensure that advertisements are delivered only through the utilization of anonymous consumer data.</p>
