 Law enforcement requests Twice a year we publish the number of legal demands for customerÂ data that we receive from law enforcement agencies around the world.
While this report only covers law enforcement requests, Microsoft follows the same principles for responding to government requests for all customer data.
Requests for customer data
Government requests for customer data must comply with applicable laws.
A subpoena or its local equivalent is required to request non-content data, and a warrant, court order, or its local equivalent, is required for content data.
