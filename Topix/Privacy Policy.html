<p>Topix does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
For example, Topix DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors.
Topix notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, mobile device identifiers, and IP address with each query.
That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users.

These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
Topix encourages you to read the privacy policy of all web sites you visit.
Topix may choose to exhibit its results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When Topix uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a Topix page, information about the click is sent to Topix, and Topix in turn sends you to the site you clicked on.
Topix uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Topix's technology.</p>

<p>Topix may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
