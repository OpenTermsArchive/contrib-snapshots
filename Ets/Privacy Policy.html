Privacy and Security Privacy and Security <p>Educational Testing Service ("ETS") recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Notice describes our practices related to personal information privacy and security.</p>
<p>ETS has a global privacy program to protect all "Personal Information." Personal Information is any information that we can use to identify you (such as your name, username or identification number) or contact you (such as your email address or telephone number).
Personal Information includes other types of information (such as test scores or demographic data) when that information is associated with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice describes our practices with respect to Personal Information we collect via "Websites." The term "Website" includes all ETS websites, platforms and applications that collect personal information from you.
It also describes our practices with respect to Personal Information collected in other ways, such as when you register for and take ETS tests, or when we receive information from a school or test center administrator.
If you are a test taker, additional information about privacy and security is included in many of the ETS Test Bulletins.</p>
<p>By using an ETS Website or otherwise providing us with Personal Information, you agree to our privacy terms.
You can contact us at any time with questions or concerns about privacy by sending an email to etsinfo@ets.org or by writing to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.</p>

</ul>Children
<p>In most cases, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children under the age of 16 on our Websites.
Parents and schools may use our Websites to create accounts for children, such as registering them for tests.
We encourage parents and teachers to spend time online with children and to monitor their online activities.
If you believe that a child has created an account on our Website, please contact us to have the account deactivated by sending us an email at etsinfo@ets.org or by calling us at 1-609-921-9000.</p>
<p>ETS does provide parents and teachers with the ability to download certain apps that they and their children or students can use for educational purposes, such as to improve reading fluency.
Some of these apps are intended for use by children under 13.</p>
<p>When children use these apps, ETS may collect the child's first name or nickname, age or grade in school, audio recordings of the child's voice when the child reads passages (or a transcript of the recording), the child's responses to questions that test skills such as reading comprehension, and other data relating to the child's use of the app, such as how long the child the spends using the app.
Our apps do not collect any other Personal Information and they do not use cookies or other data collection technologies.</p>
<p>ETS anonymizes the information collected by its educational apps and uses the information for research purposes.
ETS does not maintain identifiable data about children, and children cannot make their own data publicly available via the apps.
ETS does not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers can review and delete the child's information at any time in the app.
Parents and teachers can restrict ETS's collection of additional information at any time by deleting the app.
Parents or teachers who have any questions about how ETS handles children's data may contact ETS by sending us an email at etsinfo@ets.org or by calling us at 1-609-921-9000.</p>

Biometric Identifiers
<p>Where permitted by law, ETS collects and uses biometric identifiers to identify and authenticate test takers and test center administrators.
ETS collects digital photographs and digital voice recordings, and coverts these samples into mathematical representations called templates, which can be compared to the templates previously collected by ETS and to templates created from your government-issued identification documents.
ETS uses these templates solely to support test security and integrity and for related purposes (such prosecution of fraud or intellectual property theft).
Biometric templates are securely stored and only accessible to those individuals and entities who reasonably need access to the data in connection with investigations, compliance and securityor who provide support for the biometric program.
Biometric identifiers are retained for three years, unless a shorter period is required by law.
To receive a copy of our Biometric Information Privacy Policy, please contact us via email to etsinfo@ets.org or write to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.</p>
<p>Back to Top</p>
Use of Information by ETS Research
<p>ETS uses anonymized and pseudonymized information for various research initiatives.
For example, ETS may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions.
Similarly, educational apps, such as Relay Reader, collect data to help ETS understand and improve reading skills.
ETS's research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias.
They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment.</p>
<p>ETS may process Personal Information as needed to create de-identified datasets for research.
ETS will not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data.
Our research results do not contain any identifiable data, and research data are not used to target or profile individuals.</p>
