<strong>Information Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies) </strong>
</p>

Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it.

<p>Voice of America websites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences for interacting with the site.
A few VOA websites may also make use of persistent cookies to remember you between visits so, for example, you can save your customized preference settings for future visits.
Each VOA site using persistent cookies identifies itself as doing so.</p>

<p>
<strong>Corrections</strong>
</p>
<p>VOANews.com handles errors in the following way: If the error is a simple typo that doesn't change facts or understanding of the story, we consider it a minor change and simply correct it without further mention.
If the error is substantive or one of fact, we change it, add an asterisk *, then a note at the bottom saying when it was corrected and what was wrong originally.
On a breaking news story, we may overwrite the text of an article several times as the story develops.
Due to the urgency of the news and time constraints, we will not mention the exact changes in each version - we expect understanding that it is a story that is still developing.</p>
