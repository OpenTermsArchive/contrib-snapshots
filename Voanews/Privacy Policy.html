Corrections VOANews.
com handles errors in the following way: If the error is a simple typo that doesn't change facts or understanding of the story, we consider it a minor change and simply correct it without further mention.
If the error is substantive or one of fact, we change it, add an asterisk *, then a note at the bottom saying when it was corrected and what was wrong originally.
On a breaking news story, we may overwrite the text of an article several times as the story develops.
Due to the urgency of the news and time constraints, we will not mention the exact changes in each version - we expect understanding that it is a story that is still developing.
