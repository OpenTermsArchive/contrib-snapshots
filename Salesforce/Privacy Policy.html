<br>
Salesforce uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful.

<p>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong>
<br>
Salesforce uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon.
For example, Salesforce may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites.
Salesforce uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites, Services and email communications.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data</strong>
<br>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer our Web sites and Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage.
Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website.
This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services.
For example, Salesforce uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.
Salesforce also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Social Media Features and Single Sign-on</strong>
<br>
The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button (“Social Media Features”).
These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network.
Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.
Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our Web sites and Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect.
These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Do Not Track</strong>
<br>
Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
Salesforce does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
  5.

<p>Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform contacts about the Company’s Web sites and Services.

  12.
Mobile applications
<p>Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Salesforce may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”).
Mobile Applications provided by Salesforce may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application.
For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services.
access the call history on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload that information to the Services.
access calendar information on a User’s Device to enable the User to match meeting attendees with contacts submitted by the User to the Services.
access the geographic location of a User’s Device to enable the User to identify contacts submitted by the User the Services who are nearby.
or access contact information on a User’s Device to enable the User to sync contact information between the information that is stored on the User’s Device and the information that is submitted to the Services.
Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services.
Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.</p>
<p>Mobile Applications may provide Salesforce with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Salesforce may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services.
For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken).
Salesforce may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services.
In addition, if a User downloads a Salesforce Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Salesforce, the third-party advertiser may provide Salesforce with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Salesforce may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Customers may configure Salesforce Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration.
In addition, if a Customer purchases more than one Service from Salesforce and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services.
for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services.
Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application.
Salesforce may provide updated versions of its Mobile Applications.
If your mobile device’s settings permit, those updates will be downloaded and installed automatically on your mobile device.
By installing a Salesforce Mobile Application on your mobile device, you consent to the downloading and updating of that Mobile Application.</p>
<p>In addition to Mobile Applications offered by Salesforce, the Company may offer platforms for the creation of third-party Mobile Applications, including but not limited to the Salesforce1 platform.
Third parties may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services associated with any third-party Mobile Applications that Users download, install, use, or otherwise interact with over a Salesforce platform.
Salesforce’s Mobile Applications may also contain links or integrations to other Mobile Applications provided by third parties.
Third parties’ use of information collected through third-party Mobile Applications is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties.
The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of third-party providers of Mobile Applications to understand their information practices.</p>
<p>Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application.
The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices.
The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under Salesforce’s Master Subscription Agreement with the Customer or under this Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Master Subscription Agreement with Salesforce (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to Salesforce’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply.
