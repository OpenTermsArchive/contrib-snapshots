<p>When planning a break with us, we do our best to make sure that you have all the information needed to find your perfect holiday.
To help us do this, we need to ask for a little personal information from you.
We’ll either ask you for personal information directly or, with your permission, gather it by tracking how you use our website.
When we do share your personal information, it’s always so we can provide you with an experience that is tailored for you. </p>

We’ll also collect technical information, which helps us make sure our website is working at its best, so you can have a smooth experience when browsing.
We will occasionally share information with third parties (such as business partners and service providers) so we can give you the best possible service. </p>
<p>If you’re going on a break with us, we’ll ask you to tell us a little more about yourself, including any health conditions.
We only do this so we can plan your break around any special requirements you might have. </p>
<p>We keep your personal information safe and secure, and only hold onto it for a limited time.
If you’d like to stop receiving our email marketing and offers, you can click ‘unsubscribe’ at any time. </p>
