The information we gather
<p>We gather the following types of information about users:</p>
<p>
<b>Information you give us</b>: In certain areas of the Sites, such as those in which you register for and complete a profile, post content that you have created (such as blogs, articles, photos or reviews), create a new account, subscribe to any of our mailing lists or promotions, or enter contests sponsored by us, or indicate that you want to receive more information about certain products or services, we may request that you provide us with certain personal information.
That personal information, could include but is not limited to your username for the Sites or third party social media services, e-mail address, phone number, name, postcode, profession, job title, or work experience (collectively, “personal data”).

<p>
<b>Information we collect about you</b>: When you use the Sites we may automatically collect technical information and information about your visit including pages you visited, the order in which they were visited, page interaction information (such as the links you “clicked” or the content you viewed or consumed), the type of device you are using, IP address, operating system, header information and browser software.
We may collect information that allows us to associate you with your social media or other accounts that you have on other websites.</p>
<p>

In the course of aggregating the data, we anonymize and de-identify it so it cannot be associated with you, which means that Aggregated Data is not personal data.
We may disclose Aggregated Data to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.</p>
<p>

How we use the information we gather
<p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather.

<b>How we use Aggregated Data</b>: As we explain above, Aggregated Data does not identify any specific individual and is not personal data.
However, we would like you to understand how we use Aggregated Data.
We use Aggregated Data to build higher quality, more useful SourceForge Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the SourceForge Services.

Such personal data may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personal data that a user chooses to submit to public pages.</p> C.
How we share information we gather
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We may share your personal data with third party service providers to help us with our business activities such as email marketing, telemarketing, offering customer service, or operating a community forum.
We include provisions within our contract with these companies to ensure that they: (i) use your personal data only as necessary to provide these services to us.
and (ii) establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we provide them.</li>
<li>* We may also share your personal data with our advertisers, vendors, and customers, including data profiling companies, business-to-business lead buyers, and data aggregation companies that track user behavior.
We include provisions within our contract with these companies to ensure that they: (i) use your personal data only as permitted by applicable law.

Aggregated Data is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.</li>
<li>We may share certain data from the Sites with researchers and research organizations for the purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on free and/or open source software.
We may further choose to establish agreements for these parties to act in a clearinghouse capacity and authorize them to share this data with other researchers studying free and/or open source software.
When data from these websites is transmitted to researchers, we make commercially reasonable efforts to remove personally identifiable information from data fields designed to capture personally identifiable information (other than user names and information that users have made publicly available through one of the Sites).

<li>We may disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems, servers, networks or business, to protect and defend our rights or property and/or the rights or property of third parties (as permitted by law), and/or to detect, prevent or otherwise address security or technical issues;</li>
<li>We may also disclose your personal data as required by law or regulation, such as to comply with legal processes and/or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate and address fraud, or respond to a government request.
We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our systems, servers, networks or the SourceForge Services for illegal activities.
We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Sites in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement or other published guidelines.</li>

EEA Rights under the GDPR
<p>Users who are resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) will have additional rights when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect on May 25, 2018.
Like many companies, we are in the process of evaluating the potential applicability of the GDPR to our business and conforming our data protection practices to the extent appropriate.
 Currently, EEA users benefit from our certification to Privacy Shield, which is described at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
 We already follow the GDPR’s standard for gathering consent from EEA users for consent-based processing, since (to the extent the GDPR applies to us) we plan on continuing to rely on those consents after the GDPR takes effect.
 And of course you already have the right to revoke your consent after giving it.
 The remainder of this section describes the rights that EEA users will have in connection with this Privacy Policy as of May 25, 2018, and provides certain notices that also will go into effect as of that date.</p>
<p>To make this section more reader-friendly, we use everyday words such as use, transfer and storage to describe what we do with your personal data – but this Notice covers processing of any kind that is subject to EEA data protection law.</p>
<p>
<b>How we will use and share your personal data</b>:  We will use and share your personal data as described in this section and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>How we secure your data</b>: See our description of our security practices here.</p>
<p>
<b>Basis for processing of your personal data</b>:  We rely on three primary bases for processing EEA personal data.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is our legitimate interests, which we weigh against any risks to your rights.
By “legitimate interests,” we mean the ordinary needs and objectives of a business that offers the types of services available on our Sites, including security, quality assurance (such as preventing the dissemination or malware and misuse of our Sites and services), customer service, communicating with users to better serve them, and improving and developing new products and services.
</li>
<li>The second one is when processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>The third basis is consent – you will know when we are relying on consent because we will have expressly asked you for your consent (and if you don’t give us consent, we won’t perform the processing in question).
 Also, the sections titled “How we use personal data” and “How we share information we gather” flag the uses that are based on consent by marking them with an asterisk.</li>
<li>We may also process your personal data on the basis that we need to do so to fulfill our legal obligations.
We expect this would be a rare situation.</li>
</ul>
<b>Revoking your consent</b>: If you have given us consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw it by emailing us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com.
 You can withdraw your consent at any time, although your withdrawal will not apply to processing that took place with your consent before you withdrew it.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
<b>“Special” or “sensitive” personal data</b>:  We do not intentionally collect any personal data that is considered “special” or “sensitive” under the GDPR, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,  trade-union membership, genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health or anything to do with a person’s sexuality.
 We also do not collect information about criminal convictions or offenses.
 We request that you refrain from sharing any such personal data via the Sites or in connection with our services.</p>
<p>
<b>Access, correction, restriction and deletion</b>.
 Your right to access your data and/or correct your data, and how to make a request, is described in the section titled “Access.”  You may request a copy of your personal data, and we reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for providing a copy to you, as permitted by applicable law.
 You may also request that your data be deleted, and we will comply with your deletion request unless applicable law permits us to refuse the request, in which case we will tell you that we have rejected your request and give you the reasons why.
 You may request that the use of your personal data be restricted, subject to Article 21 of the GDPR.
 If you make a data restriction request, we will discuss it with you and, in any event, we will comply with any obligations we may have under Article 21 of the GDPR.
 Where appropriate, we may address your request by de-identifying the data such that it no longer identifies you, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>
<b>Data Portability</b>.
The GDPR may provide certain rights relating to data portability.
 You may request data portability to the extent provided by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
<b>Profiling.
 </b>Paragraph (b) under the section titled “How we share information we gather” describes how we use personal data for profiling, and how we share profiles with third parties.
You can opt out of profiling for direct marketing at any time by contacting us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com and we will honor your request.
 When we engage in profiling for other purposes that don’t involve direct marketing, we will consider your request and honor it unless we determine that we have  compelling legitimate in continuing the profiling that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the continued profiling is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
We expect that this would be rare, but one example might be profiling to prevent fraud or the misuse of our Sites and services.
 We will explain our reasoning to you if we reject your request to stop profiling.</p>

<b>How long we keep your personal data</b>: See the section on “Data retention”.</p>
<p>
<b>Who will receive your personal data</b>: See “How we share information we gather’.

<b>Data transfers to third countries</b>:  We provide our Sites and related services from the USA and may use service providers in various countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as is in your country.

 Your data will be transferred to the USA (where we are based).
 We may also transfer your data to other countries outside the EEA for processing by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our contractors, or for recipients of data that are described under “How we share information we gather.”   Any personal data that we share is subject to the requirements of Privacy Shield, and we require third parties to provide appropriate contractual commitments to treat your personal data in accordance with our “onward transfers” obligations under Privacy Shield.
