<p>16.2<strong>&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures</strong>. You and the Company agree that, except as provided in Section 16.5 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this ToU (each a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 16 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 16 will control and prevail.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 16.5, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and the Company will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim.

The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p>

If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. In the event any litigation or arbitration is brought by either party in connection with this ToU, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation or arbitration.</p>

You and the Company agree that if any portion this Section 16 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 16.5), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 16.5 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor the Company will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 16.5 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of San Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<p>In addition, Wire also uses transport encryption to encrypt metadata.</p>
<p>Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers and automatically deletes them after they are sent to the recipient. This is done to enable Wire to send messages to users who are not currently online as soon as they are back online.</p>

Wire will disclose personal data to third parties only if and to the extent necessary to provide the third party service (e.g., to respond to a support request), if required by law or legal process, or if necessary to enforce the Terms of Use and/or protect Wire’s rights.</p>
<p>Wire will not disclose your data to public authorities unless Wire is obliged to do so under Swiss law.</p>
<p>In addition, to the extent permitted by data protection law, Wire may disclose your personal data to third parties if we (or our affiliates) are acquired by that third party with any of our assets or voting securities (or those of our affiliates) or if we are otherwise involved in a transaction with similar financial effect. In such a situation, we will use reasonable efforts to require the third party to process your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy in relation to your personal data. If your personal data is subsequently used in a manner different from that described in this Privacy Policy, we ask the third party to notify you in advance.</p>
<p>To the extent that Wire transfers personal data to third parties located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) (see also the overview of third party providers above), Wire will ensure that (i) the third party is located in a state that has been recognized by the EU Commission as having an equivalent level of data protection or or/and (ii) Wire has concluded “standard data protection clauses” with the third party within the meaning of Art. 46 § 2 c) GDPR or/and (iii) there is another guarantee within the meaning of Art. 46 or exception under Art. 49 GDPR. If you use third-party services such as YouTube, Spotify, Giphy etc. via the Wire application, all data that you share with these services is subject to their privacy policies.</p>

<p>You also have the right to object to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 § 1 e) or f) GDPR. Unless we are still legally obliged or entitled to process your personal data, we will no longer process your personal data (Art. 21 § 1 GDPR). If you object to the use of your data for the purposes of direct marketing, we will no longer process the personal data concerned for these purposes (Art. 21 § 2 GDPR).</p>
<p>You may revoke any declarations of consent you have given at any time (Art. 7 § 3 GDPR). Revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation. You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority.</p>

<p>1.2. Nature, purpose and duration of processing: The data processing shall serve the purpose of providing a software solution for messaging services as described in the ToU being an integral part of the Service. The duration of the processing shall be in line with the duration of the provision of the Service.</p>
<p>1.3. Group of data subjects: Users of the Service whom the Controller enrolls to the Service as well as persons whose personal data is included in the content of the communication between the users.</p>
<p>1.4. Type of personal data processed: Wire processes the following types of personal data on behalf of the Controller:</p>
<p>Metadata of the Service; this, particularly, includes information on the creator of a team, conversation name and pseudonymised participants list as well as the team assignments of the participants;<br>
full name and email address and / or mobile phone number;<br>
temporary traffic data of the Service like log files including user’s type of equipment and IP addresses;<br>
end-to-end encrypted communication data, such as messages and files (Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers for the purpose of allowing those messages to later be delivered to offline clients once the clients get back online. Wire does not hold the decryption keys to those messages and therefore cannot access the content);<br>
data separately provided by the user, e. g. profile picture.</p>
<p>1.5. Processor: With respect to the processing of personal data as part of this DPA, Wire is the Processor in the meaning of Art. 4 (8) GDPR.</p>
<p>1.6. Place of Processing: Wire generally performs the contractually agreed processing of personal data on servers within the Member States of the European Union and Switzerland. If the agreed performances are nevertheless provided outside the area of Member States of the European Union or Switzerland on instructions of the Controller, Wire shall ensure that the transfer of personal data is admissible pursuant to Art. 44 et seqq. GDPR by making sure that at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>
<p>There is an adequacy decision by the European Commission for the third country;<br>
appropriate safeguards are put in place (i.e. binding corporate rules (BCR), standard data protection clauses, approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms);<br>
the data transfer is covered by derogations for specific situations pursuant to Art. 49 GDPR.</p>
<p>1.7. Instructions by the Controller: Wire will process personal data as the Processor as specified in the ToU and the DPA. The ToU and the DPA contain all instructions by the Controller on data processing. Accordingly, Wire will process the data:</p>
<p>Insofar as required with respect to the scope and type for the purpose of providing the Service and for meeting the obligations from the ToU and this DPA;<br>
insofar as Wire is obliged to do so pursuant to the law of the European Union of the law of the Member States to which Wire is subject (in such a case, Wire shall notify the Controller of that legal requirement before processing, unlee that law prohibits such notification on important grounds of public interest).</p>
<p>The Controller shall retain the right to issue instructions regarding the data processing according to the provision of the ToU and this DPA. Instructions by the Controller shall be agreed with Wire and documented. Any expenses incurred by Wire for this purpose shall be reimbursed by the Controller.</p>

<p>2.2. Control rights: Wire is obliged to provide the Controller with all information required to demonstrate compliance with Wire’s obligations pursuant to this DPA, in particular, the technical and organizational measures pursuant to §4 of this DPA, before commencement of the data processing and regularly during the data processing. The Controller shall be entitled to inspect compliance with Wire’s obligations under this DPA to an appropriate extent, either personally or by a third party, in particular, by obtaining information on the technical and organizational measures and, in case this information is not sufficient, by on-site inspections (“Inspections”). The Inspections at the Processor shall be carried out without avoidable disruption of the business of the Processor and without violation of the protection of personal data. As a rule, Inspections shall be carried out upon reasonable notice, in urgent cases also without notice, and during the business hours of the Processor, however, as a rule, but no more frequently than every 12 months.</p>

The Processor shall assist the Controller, if possible, by appropriate technical or organizational measures to enable the Controller to comply with any data subject rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR. The Processor shall answer data subject requests only if the Controller instructs the Processor to do so or if the Processor is obliged to do so by law. The assistance by the Processor to the Controller in the context of data subjects’ rights may be subject to a charge.</p>
<p>3.2. Data confidentiality: The Processor shall ensure that all employees who have access to personal data are informed of the confidential nature of the personal data and of any special data protection requirements arising from this commission, in particular, the limitation of data processing to specific purposes as instructed by the Controller and that all such employees have entered into confidentiality agreements with the Processor.</p>
<p>3.3. Further assistance of the Controller, inter alia, with regard to technical and organizational measures. The Processor shall assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the Processor. 3.4. Information about concerns: The Processor shall inform the Controller without undue delay if the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction of the Controller infringes the GDPR or other data protection provisions of the Union or the Member States. The Processor shall be entitled to suspend the execution of the relevant instruction until the Controller confirms or changes it.</p>

Security incident notification: In case of security incidents, the Processor is obliged to apply all necessary measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data without undue delay. Furthermore, in case of a data breach, the Processor shall notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of such breach. In this case Wire will provide the Controller with all required information enabling the Controller to comply with its statutory obligations.</p>

A subcontractor involvement requires that the Processor (a) ensures that the subcontractor fulfils Processor’s duties according to this DPA and (b) assumes liability towards the data subject for actions of the subcontractor concerned, as if these actions were taken by the Processor itself. At the time of the conclusion of this DPA, Wire engages the following subcontractors: Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg for the provision of the server infrastructure and Zeta Project Germany GmbH, Rosenthaler Str. 40, 10178 Berlin, for the development of the services. Wire shall inform the Controller about the involvement of any further or replacement of any subcontractor. The Controller shall have the opportunity to object to the involvement within one month after having been informed. In the event of Controller’s objection, Wire shall be entitled to an extraordinary termination right.</p>
<p>6.2. Territorial scope: The Processor may not use any subcontractors located outside the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or Switzerland for processing personal data.</p>
