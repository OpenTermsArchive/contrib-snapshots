                        Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h3>

<p>16.1&nbsp;<strong>Dispute Resolution Procedure</strong>. You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relates to your use of the Apps, Site or the Service such dispute or claim shall be resolved in accordance with the following escalation procedure:</p>
<p>a. you and the Company will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties;</p>

<p>16.2&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>. You and the Company agree that, except as provided in Section 16.5 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this ToU (each a&nbsp;<strong>“Claim”</strong>), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the&nbsp;<strong>“JAMS Rules”</strong>) and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 16 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 16 will control and prevail. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 16.5, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and the Company will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
<p>16.3&nbsp;<strong>Location</strong>. The arbitration will be conducted in the County of San Francisco, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.</p>
<p>16.4&nbsp;<strong>Limitations</strong>. You and the Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between the Company and you individually. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>16.5&nbsp;<strong>Exceptions to Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;You and the Company agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the Company’s intellectual property rights; or (b) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
<p>16.6&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Fees; Attorneys Fees.</strong>&nbsp;If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. In the event any litigation or arbitration is brought by either party in connection with this ToU, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation or arbitration.</p>
<p>16.7&nbsp;<strong>Severability.</strong>&nbsp;You and the Company agree that if any portion this Section 16 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 16.5), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 16.5 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor the Company will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 16.5 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of San Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
