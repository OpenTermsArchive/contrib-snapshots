<p>We use industry-standard efforts such as firewalls, data-encryption methods and password-protected data sources to safeguard the confidentiality of your information.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
If sensitive data is collected through this Web site, we will encrypt your personal information before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.
