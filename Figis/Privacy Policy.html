[top] What information do you collect when I visit your Web site? Generally, our customers can visit our Web site without providing or revealing any personal or personally identifiable information.
We receive and store certain types of information whenever visitors interact with our Web site.
We may track the Internet domain address from which our visitors visit our Web site and analyze this data for trends and statistics.
Unless a visitor to our Web site voluntarily provides personal information to us, each individual customer remains anonymous.
We receive and may store certain personal information that our visitors enter when visiting our Web site or provide to us in other ways.
For instance, we collect the information you provide to us when you place an order, register with us, send an e-mail or call us, enter a sweepstakes or contest, subscribe to a service, enroll in a club, request to receive a catalog or direct mail, or participate in a promotion.
This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, product purchases, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, and other similar personal or preference data that you provide to us.
It may also include information you submit about other people such as the name and address of a gift recipient.
Whether or not you provide such information to us is completely your own choice.
[top] What is your e-mail policy? We will not sell, rent, or trade your e-mail address to any unaffiliated third party without your permission.
We believe that your e-mail address is personal and should be kept that way.
We use your e-mail address to provide better customer service, to facilitate your transactions, and to be able to inform you of internet offers, promotions and updates from Figi's, Inc.
and its affiliates and partners.
[top] How do you use my information? We use the personal and/or personally identifiable information you provide for our internal purposes, such as confirming, fulfilling and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products (including products of our affiliates), services and offers, and providing you with information from and about our catalogs and Web site.
When you place an order we also use your personal and/or personally identifiable information to fulfill your order.
When you place an order, we may also provide your personal and/or personally identifiable information to our marketing partners to enable them to fulfill your order.
From time to time, we may also work with other organizations that we believe are trustworthy and offer products or services that may be of interest to you.
In such instances, we might share limited information (such as your name and/or postal address) that we have collected from you, including personally identifiable information, so that such organizations may contact you with offers that may interest you.
Be assured, however, that we will not share your information with these organizations if you have requested that we refrain from doing so.
On our Web site, we may provide links to other Web sites that are not owned or controlled by Figi's, Inc.
While we select these associations carefully, we are not responsible for the security and privacy policies or practices of the Web sites accessed through these links.
You should refer to these Web sites for their respective privacy and security policies.
You access such linked Web sites at your own risk.
To serve you better, we may combine the information you give us online, through our catalogs and order forms; publicly available information; and information we receive from others.
We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.
Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to provide certain services for our business, such as credit card processing, order processing, fulfillment and management, computer system services, web site operation services, shipping, data management, or promotional services.
We provide the information needed for these service providers to perform these services.
The information we provide may include some of our customers' personal and personally identifiable information.
However, these service providers are not authorized to use any of the information we share with them for any purposes other than to provide services to us.
We may share information that we have collected with governmental agencies and other organizations assisting us in fraud prevention or for investigative purposes.
We may do so when permitted or mandated by law; trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized or improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has already taken place.
In these instances, the information is not provided to these agencies or organizations for marketing or any other unrelated purposes.
Additionally, we may share your e-mail address, name, telephone number, and postal address within the Figi's, Inc.
family (including our parent Charming Shoppes, Inc.
and its affiliates).
Also, when you purchase from us through our catalog or our Web site we may need to contact you via phone, e-mail, or mail to address issues specific to your order, even if you have opted to not receive communications from us.
From time to time we may also market certain third party services through our site.
Should you choose to accept an offer from a third party, we will pass your relevant personal information, including your name, postal address, credit/debit card number and any other required billing information to that specific third party.
Finally, if some or all of the business assets of Figi's, Inc.
are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and visitors to the purchaser.
We also may retain a copy of that information.

The opportunity to opt out of a specific text message marketing campaign will be made available with the messages we send.
Please note that, with text message campaigns, an opt-in or opt-out request is currently associated only with a specific marketing campaign and a specific mobile phone number.
As a result, a request associated with one campaign and phone number will not apply to other campaigns or numbers.

We aggregate this information in order to improve our site, and we may share this information with our affiliates or other outside companies.

Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights Under California law, a California resident with whom Charming Shoppes has an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information Charming Shoppes has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.
All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to: Charming Direct, Inc.
, 3750 State Street, Bensalem, PA 19020, Attention: Corporate Customer Relations.
This same California law permits Charming Shoppes to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information.
You may exercise that choice by the means described under "How do I opt out of sharing of my information?" [top] What is your position as to children's privacy? Our Web site is a general-audience Web site and is not directed to anyone under the age of thirteen ("Children").
We do not seek to solicit information from Children.
If Children submit information to us and we know that the individuals submitting the information are indeed Children, we will delete the information as soon as we discover it, we will not use the information for any purpose, and we will not disclose the information to third parties.
We urge parents and guardians to participate in their Children's online activities and use parental control or Web filtering technology to supervise Children's access to the Internet.

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the personal information that you share with us.
The personal information you provide to us is preserved behind a firewall, instead of being directly connected to the Internet.
Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Once we receive your transmission, we have appropriate security measures in place within our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the personal information you have provided to us.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.
We use industry-standard efforts such as firewalls, data-encryption methods and password-protected data sources to safeguard the confidentiality of your information.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
If sensitive data is collected through this Web site, we will encrypt your personal information before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.

[top] Will your privacy and security policies ever change? From time to time, our privacy and security practices may change.
If we modify our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to address these changes, we will indicate when such changes are made by changing the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Policy.
