</p>
<p>Currently, Healthline, DoubleClick (Healthline's ad server and a division of Google), Google (via its Google Analytics service), the Trade Desk, Krux, AppNexus and various advertisers and other ad technology companies collect anonymous information on the Services.
Healthline utilizes Google Analytics to count, track, and aggregate visitors' activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within Healthline properties).
For more information on Google Analytics privacy practices, see: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.
For more information on the Trade Desk, see: http://thetradedesk.com/general/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>You recognize and agree that the third party analytics companies utilized by Healthline may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities.
These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
</p>
<p>In addition, we may merge information about you with the data of a larger group of users, which then may be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.
However, Healthline will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission.
When Healthline does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you.
The entities collecting this anonymous information use it to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring and improvement, and targeted advertising on and off the Website.
You should know that some of our partners (or the partners of our partners) may connect anonymous information collected on our site(s) with your identity if you have provided your identity to those partners or partners of partners (e.g., you may have provided data to an ecommerce site which knows your identity and can connect that identity with your behavior on a Healthline site through the placement of a web beacon).</p> Ad serving technology <p>We use third-party advertising companies and exchanges to serve ads.
These third-party ad servers and exchange providers may use web beacons and cookies to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.
They use data (such as sites visited and browser type) gathered over time and across their networks of webpages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about this practice, as well as your choices about not having this information used for online behavioral advertising by these ad networks, click here: http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.</p>
<p>Our sponsors and advertisers have agreed that they will not collect any personally identifiable information from our site visitors while they’re on Healthline.
If you click on an advertisement on Healthline and visit a site maintained by one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.
You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you.</p>
<p>Healthline reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Healthline or Healthline's third party partners and contractors.
Healthline may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through the Services.
Healthline or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Services.
Healthline or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-app information that is not personally identifiable.
The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
</p>
<p>You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Healthline may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products.
These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
These ad serving technologies are integrated into App.
if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access App.
Although Healthline takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Healthline does not have access to or control of third party technologies.
We recommend that you read the privacy policies of those third parties to see how your information is handled.</p>

Personal data may, however, be disclosed in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.
Additionally, Healthline may disclose personal data to any of its affiliated companies in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>Healthline may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Healthline's behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Healthline.
These third parties may be based in other jurisdictions than your country of residence (including without limitation, the United States of American) and the information provided to these third parties may be available to the government of these jurisdictions or their agencies under a lawful order made in that jurisdiction.
These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.
Healthline may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers.
Healthline has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for Healthline.
Healthline is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as required by law.
</p>
<p>Healthline may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement, courts, or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Healthline to legal liability.
Healthline may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Healthline has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Healthline's rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Healthline believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Healthline's rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Healthline.
To the extent permitted by applicable law and in Healthline’s sole discretion, Healthline will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through Healthline's website or in another reasonable manner.
</p>
<p>Healthline occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests, or other events that require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact and demographic information that may or may not be shared with participating sponsors.
As part of such a sponsored program, the registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to third party or nonparticipating organizations without the user’s consent, and Healthline will request that co-sponsors of such events maintain the privacy of the registrant’s information.</p>

If you would like to understand how this digital service’s participation in the Network affects your privacy, please click here: http://usersupport.dmdconnects.com/PrivacyPolicy.htm</p>
<p>Please note that the Network registration/login system may be different from the registration/login used by the Healthline Services for other products and services.
To the extent that anything in this privacy policy conflicts with the policy for the Network technologies, the conflict will be resolved in favor of the policy applicable to the Network technologies.
</p> Data access, retention and correctness <p>You may have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of applicable law.
These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.

We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity.
In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.</p>
