Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Anyone Under 13? We do not collect personal information online from children under 13 without consent of a parent or legal guardian except in special, limited circumstances.
If your child is under 13 and wants to use our sites with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, games or clubs, we might ask your child to "register.
" They can often do so anonymously by just providing a user name and password, but sometimes we need their first name and e-mail address.
When we ask for your child's first name, your child is encouraged to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only they know.
Sometimes we will ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site.
With your verifiable consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last name, address or e-mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity.
If we need more than just your child's first name (or screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular online activity, we will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so that we can notify you of your child's request and get your permission.
When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information you or your child provides us, and we will tell you how you can review your child's information and ask us to delete the information.
We don't keep your (or your child's) e-mail address unless you tell us it is okay.
Mattel might collect an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) from your child under 13 without your consent, but only in the following special cases: If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their e-mail address for long enough to respond to them.
Mattel deletes this information from our system after we answer their question.
If a child under 13 signs up for an e-mail newsletter, or other activity that requires multiple online contacts with the child, we also ask the child for a parent's or legal guardian's e-mail address so we can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out.
Occasionally, Mattel has special site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests that are open to children even if they are under 13.
In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information from your child than what is necessary for your child to participate in the activity.
In the latter situation we require your child to give us your e-mail address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service.
If we need more than an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) to enter your child in the promotion or offer the service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and why, and generally ask that you (not your child) provide it.
For instance, we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has won.
Any information you or your child give us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.
We may offer enhanced services available to children under 13.
In such cases, a parent must register for the service and establish the appropriate permission level for the child.
Content and activities available to you or your child may vary depending on the subscription and site.
Parents will be provided with information on the type of content and activities their child may access at the time they subscribe and are always in charge of their child's account.
Subscription fees may apply for some services.
We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, game or other activity as a condition of participation.
