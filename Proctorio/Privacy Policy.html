The Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if It wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.</p><p class=""><strong>P</strong><strong>roctorio does not use what is conventionally known as “biometrics” or “facial recognition” technology. </strong>Facial recognition uniquely identifies specific people by assessing whether the face in one image matches the face in another image. It requires a database of either images of people’s faces, or biometric representations of them, and technology that compares new images or biometric representations with entries in that database.</p><p class=""><strong>Instead, Proctorio uses “facial detection” or “gaze detection” technology. </strong>A fundamental difference between these technologies and biometrics or facial recognition technology is that facial or gaze detection technologies do not use geometry or landmarks as identifiers. Additionally this difference, can be illustrated by the questions they answer:</p><p class=""><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> “Does the face in this picture match the face in this other picture?”</p><p class=""><strong>Facial Detection:</strong> “Is there a face in this picture?”</p><p class=""><strong>Gaze Detection:</strong> “Is the person looking away from the camera or the exam screen?”</p><p class="highlight"><strong>Facial detection can identify that there is a human face present in an image or video recording, but it cannot identify that person – only that there is, indeed, a person in the image or recording.</strong></p><p class="highlight"><strong>Gaze detection can determine the direction that the individual is looking, but cannot identify who they are or what they are looking at.</strong></p><p class="">If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio uses facial detection to flag video evidence that may indicate the number of individuals present within the immediate vicinity of the test taker, but Proctorio does not attempt to determine who those individuals are.</p><p class="">If a test taker is not able to pass the face detection process and enter an exam within three attempts, a Proctorio Support Agent initiates a live chat to troubleshoot the issue. The Support Agent can request access to webcam images from the system, provide instructions that ensure clearly-captured images, and override the system if needed to expedite exam entry.</p><p class="">If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio can use gaze detection to flag video evidence that the individual was looking at something other than the device they were using to take the exam. This helps Institution-approved representatives prioritize where to review exam video recordings to determine if the test taker was consulting unauthorized materials or was receiving outside assistance during the exam attempt. However, the Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if It wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.</p></section><section class="filter-section all-users all-locations auto-proctor live-proctor lock" id="section-monitoringduringanexam"><h3>Monitoring during an exam</h3><p class="">When exam administrators select Automated or Live Proctoring Services, Proctorio uses technology to automatically collect certain information about a test taker’s activities during the exam session for purposes of protecting exam integrity. The flagged behaviors may include facial and gaze detection (described above) to monitor if the test taker leaves the session, tracked head movement to monitor how frequently the test taker looks away, sound detection to monitor if other voices are in the room, question response time, dropped internet connections, and other activities that may indicate irregular testing activities. When using these services, Proctorio’s automated technology continually monitors the applications and processes that are running on the device during an exam session and during exam review.</p><p class="">If an Institution has requested reporting, test-taker data may be aggregated, and then individual test-taker data may be compared to the aggregated data to look for patterns or anomalies, such as whether a test taker spent an unusually long time answering a question relative to other users.</p><p class="">Proctorio does not and has not established "normal" profiles or compare test takers against any preserved or aggregated normal.</p><p class="">At the end of an exam session, the Institution-approved representative will have access to a summary report of these flagged activities, as well as the raw data the Service collects from each test-taker’s session. The Institution-approved representative then determines if any further action is warranted. Aggregated data is also provided to the Institution-approved representative (e.g. the average length of time users spent on an exam question, the average time spent on the entire assessment and the average date/time that users started the exam session).</p><p class="">Only an Institution determines whether to enable settings, which settings are enabled for flagging of irregular testing behaviors, and the indication levels (green, yellow, red) assigned to certain activities of the test taker during an exam. Following the Institution-approved representative’s review, only they can determine what, if any, action to take related to a test taker.</p><p class="highlight"><strong>Proctorio does not make any decisions related to the test taker from flagged activity.</strong></p></section></section><section class="filter-section all-users all-locations auto-proctor live-proctor auto-id live-id" id="section-idverification"><h2>ID Verification</h2><p class="">Additionally, an Institution may select an option to verify the test taker’s identity before they start their exam.

Personal Information is information that identifies an individual and is defined more fully under applicable law. In these instances, test-taker Personal Information is encrypted.</p><p>Proctorio utilizes end-to-end encryption to encrypt test-taker exam recordings that Proctorio receives from an Institution. This means that no one but approved “Institution representatives” (including instructors, faculty, administrators, and other authorized staff of an Institution) can access test-taker Personal Information. Proctorio does not have the cryptographic key so it cannot access Personal Information and cannot disclose test-taker Personal Information in these instances.</p><p><strong>Institutions Control Test-Taker Personal Information</strong>. As the data processor, Proctorio only follows the instructions provided by the Institution (a “processor”). The Institution is the data controller (“controller”) and their privacy policy controls the processing of their test-taker and Institution-representative Information. The information provided in Proctorio’s Privacy Policy below is provided to test takers and Institution representatives for a general understanding of Proctorio’s privacy practices, but they should also review their respective Institution’s controlling privacy policies.</p><h3>Proctorio as a data controller</h3><p>It is important to note that this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Proctorio Terms of Service for Proctorio&#39;s Sites, when Proctorio is the controller. Any terms not defined here can be found in Proctorio&#39;s Sites&#39; <a href="/policies/#all&amp;all&amp;tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p></div><div class=""><h2 class="header-separator" id="what-applies">What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of Proctorio’s Product and Services Users (test takers and Institution representatives), Partnered Institutions and their representatives, and those who are visiting Proctorio’s websites, including potential clients and interested parties.</p><p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that Proctorio collects when it is a data controller from any of Proctorio’s websites (Proctorio’s “Sites”), <a href="https://pruefungendaheim.de">pruefungendaheim.de</a>, <a href="/">proctorio.com</a>, <a href="https://getproctorio.com">getproctorio.com</a>, <a href="https://proctoriostatus.com">proctoriostatus.com</a>, Proctorio’s mobile apps, customer service, partner relationships, and when someone contacts Proctorio directly. In those instances, individuals may be providing Personal Information to Proctorio. When Proctorio operates as a processor for an Institution, the Institution’s privacy policies are in control. See the section above for a description of when we operate as a processor.</p><h3>Institution uses</h3><p>Institutions determine which of Proctorio’s services to use and this, in turn, determines the Information that Proctorio processes. Institution products and services include, but are not limited to: Automated Proctoring, Live Proctoring, Live ID Verification, Automated ID Verification, Lock Down, WebSweep, WebFreeze, Professional Review, and Originality Verification (collectively the “Services”).</p><p>You can find more information about Proctorio&#39;s Services on the <a href="/products">Products page</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="md:my-16 py-12"><div class="container grid lg:grid-cols-2"><div class="pr-12 py-12 lg:border-r-2 border-transparent-dark"><h2 id="contact-information">Got questions? <span class="weight font-normal block lg:inline">Let&#39;s hear &#39;em!</span></h2><p class="mb-0">By email:</p><div class="flex flex-col"><div class="flex mb-8"><address class="ml-4 flex-grow-1 not-italic"><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb9b99829d8a8892ab9b9984889f84998284c5888486" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88aeabb9b9bab3aeabb9b9bcb3aeabf0beb1b3aeabb9b9b0b3aeabb1bfb3aeabf0bebbb3aeabb9bab9b3aeabf0bcb8b3aeabf0bfb8b3aeabf0bfbab3aeabb9b9b9b3aeabf0bebbb3aeabf0bfbcb3aeabb9b9b9b3aeabf0bfbab3aeabb9b8bdb3aeabf0beeeb3aeabf0baedb3aeabf0bebbb3aeabb9b9b9b3aeabb9b8b1b3">&#112;&#114;&#x69;&#118;&#97;&#x63;&#121;&#x40;&#x70;&#x72;&#111;&#x63;&#x74;&#111;&#x72;&#105;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a></a></address></div></div><p class="mb-0">By mail:</p><div class="flex flex-col"><div class="flex mb-8"><address class="ml-4 flex-grow-1 not-italic"><p>7340 E Main St, Suite 203<br>Scottsdale, AZ 85251</p></address></div></div><div class="section-card py-12 px-8 md:box-content md:-ml-8 lg:px-16 lg:-ml-16"><h4>Looking for Proctorio&#39;s other policies like the Terms of Service, Service Level Agreement, and Acceptable Use Policy?</h4><p>Check out Proctorio&#39;s Policies center by clicking below:</p><a href="/policies" class="button mb-4 lg:mb-0">Policies Center</a></div></div><div class="lg:pl-12 py-12"><h2>Updates</h2><p>Proctorio is constantly improving and expanding, so we may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p><p>If so, Proctorio will post its updated Privacy Policy on Proctorio’s Site located at proctorio.com, include a notice on the homepage of proctorio.com, and include updates on Github.
