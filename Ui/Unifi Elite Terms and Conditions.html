<li> Services and Provider Materials.
All right, title and interest in and to the Services and Provider Materials, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein, are and will remain with Provider and the respective rights holders in the Third-Party Materials.
Customer has no right, license or authorization with respect to any of the Services or Provider Materials (including Third-Party Materials) except as expressly set forth in Section 3.1 or the applicable third-party license, in each case subject to Section 3.3 and 3.4.
All other rights in and to the Services and Provider Materials (including Third-Party Materials) are expressly reserved by Provider and the respective third-party licensors.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Customer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Provider an assignment of all right, title and interest in and to the Resultant Data, including all Intellectual Property Rights relating thereto.
</li>
<li> Customer Data.

Customer shall not give Feedback that is subject to license terms that seek to require any Provider product, technology, service or documentation incorporating or derived from Feedback, or any Provider’s Intellectual Property Rights, to be licensed or otherwise shared with any third party.
For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees and acknowledges that the incorporation by Provider of any Feedback into any Provider products and/or services does not grant Customer any proprietary rights in or to any such products and/or services.
