Cookies are used to recognize information about how the User interacts with the Service, including visits to the website, what pages are accessed, and what functionalities are used, among other things.
The use of cookies is commonplace on the Internet and they take up minimal room.
Cookies work by assigning a number to your computer that has a specific meaning to the assigning website.
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any User.
Unless you choose to provide us with information about you, we will never know who you are, even though our computer has previously deposited a cookie on your computer.
In addition, you may modify your Internet browser's settings to notify you whenever any website requests to deposit a cookie on your computer.
This notification option generally gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept or refuse a cookie before it is deposited.
EMG employs the use of cookies to enable our systems to recognize your browser, to identify how and when the Service is visited and to gather analytics about the Service, among other things.
We use both persistent ID cookies, which remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove or control these persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s "help" file.<br> Our advertising and/or analytics partners may also use cookies in order to deliver targeted advertising to you.
