<br> Testimonials <strong>TD is the only place I buy computer parts</strong>
<br> first started using TD back in like 2003, when I was in the process of building my first computer.
I bought everything I needed on TD at that time, and I've bought little upgrades here and there since.
Well, now it's 2010 and that computer I built is still running strong!! TD has never let me down, I would definitely reccommend them to anyone.<br>
