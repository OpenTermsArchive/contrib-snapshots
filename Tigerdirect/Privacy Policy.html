<strong>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong>
<br> When you visit our Site, we collect information directly from you as well as through the use of cookies and web beacons about (i) your computer such as its IP address, operating systems and browser software.
(ii) the website that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages of the Site you visited, the order in which you visited those pages, and which hyperlinks you clicked.
and (iii) demographic information about you regarding age and range of income levels.
This is all done for the purposes of (i) assessing our Site traffic and the effectiveness of our Site content.
(ii) diagnosing problems with our servers, and (iii) improving the quality of your Site visits.
We may also collect information pertaining solely to corporations, government or educational entities, or other business or non-profit, which at times may involve us purchasing third party information about businesses and other entities from others.
The company information we purchase may include number of employees or annual sales information or similar information to better serve our organizational customers.
We may use any such corporate information without restriction.
We also collect your Personal Data, which we explain further directly below.
We do not track our Site visitors when they are on third-party websites.<br>
<br>
<strong>COOKIES</strong>
<br> Upon visiting our Site, we will assign you a unique ID in the form of a "cookie".
A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your browser by a website that help websites such as our Site to remember information about your visit and save your preferred settings.
Cookies are also used for such purposes as facilitating and personalizing your shopping and ordering experience, keeping track of your shopping basket during your visit, helping diagnose problems with our server and administering our Site.
In our case, we may use the information collected through cookies for marketing purposes to inform you of special offers, to better understand your needs, or to answer your questions.
For more information about cookies, please see our Cookie FAQ's.<br>
<br> There are two types of cookies: first party cookies which are created by the site you visit and third party cookies which are created by other sites who own some of the content on the site you are visiting.
You retain the ability at any time at your discretion to manage and control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser for both types of cookies as best suits your needs.
Some browsers even allow you to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis.
You may also limit or delete cookies by reviewing your cookie settings and ad settings.
For example, if you use a Google Chrome browser, the Tools menu contains an option to Clear Browsing Data.
You can use this option to delete cookies and other site and plug-in data, including data stored on your device by the Adobe Flash Player (commonly known as Flash cookies).<br>
<br> We recommend, however, that you allow cookies from our site as they enable you to utilize our features and services and limiting or deleting cookies will mean you will be signed out of our Site, lose any of your saved preferences on our Site, and be prevented from adding items to your shopping cart and proceeding to Checkout.
<br>
<br>
<strong>WEB BEACONS</strong>
<br> Some of our Web pages and HTML -formatted e-mail newsletters may use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about website usage.
A Web beacon is an electronic image often called a single- pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which is ordinarily not visible to the site visitor.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as visitor's cookie number, time and date of page or image view and description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
When used in an e-mail they can tell us whether an e-mail has been opened.
You may control whether your email client is allowed to download images and web beacons.<br>
<br>
<strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
<br>
We collect only that Personal Information that you specifically and voluntarily provide to us while using our Site.

<strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br> To help protect the security of your Personal Information, we seek to use security technology and procedures consistent with industry standards.
We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") in all areas of the Site where your personal account information is required, which means the Personal Information you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer and decrypted again on our side.
If your browser does not support SSL or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at 888-278-4437 to place your order by phone.
In addition, your personal account information and transaction history are kept behind a firewall.<br>
