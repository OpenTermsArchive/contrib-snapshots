Policies &gt; Privacy and Cookies Policies Terms &amp; Conditions Privacy and Cookies Privacy and Cookies This document describes how we use cookies on our website and how we handle and protect your personal data.
Cookies What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data placed on the computer of a user by a website.
Why do websites use cookies? Webpages have no memory.
A user who surfs from page to page within a website is not recognised as the same user across pages.
Cookies enable the user's browser to be recognised by the website.
Therefore, cookies are mainly used to remember the choices a user has made (e.
g.
, remembering the language you speak), or to recognise recurring visitors to the site.
Do all cookies do the same thing? No, there are different types of cookies used for different purposes.
Cookies can be distinguished by function, lifetime and the party that places them.
How does Booking.
com use cookies? Booking.
com offers its users an advanced and user-friendly website that adapts automatically to their needs and wishes.
To achieve this, our website uses 4 types of cookies: Technical cookies: We use technical cookies to show you our website, to make it function correctly, to create your user account, to log you in and to manage your bookings.
These technical cookies are strictly necessary for our website to function properly.
Functional cookies: We also use functional cookies to remember your preferences and to help you use our website efficiently and effectively, for example by remembering your preferred currency and language, your searches and the accommodation you have viewed earlier.
These functional cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of our website, but they add functionality for you as a user and enhance your experience.
To gain insight into how our users use the website, to find out what works and what doesn't, to optimize and improve the website and to ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant for our users, we use analytics cookies.
The data we gather includes the viewed web pages, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp information and details like the number of (mouse) clicks on a given page, mouse movements, scrolling activity and the (search) words you use and the text you type while using our website.
This information is made anonymous as we really only need statistics.
Lastly, we also use commercial cookies to show you Booking.
com advertisements on other websites (retargeting), potentially based on which destinations you have searched for, or which accommodation you have viewed.
These cookies are typically placed by trusted third parties.
How long do Booking.
com cookies stay active? Booking.
com uses several cookies, with a varying lifespan.
