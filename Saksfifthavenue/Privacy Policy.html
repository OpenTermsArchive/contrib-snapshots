Back to top   Q: What about security? A: Protecting the security of your information is very important to us.
When you transmit sensitive personal information (such as credit card information) from your computer to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online.
However, we strive to protect your information and privacy.
Back to top   Q: Does Saks use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies? A: Saks uses cookies (both session and persistent) and web beacons to enhance your browsing and shopping experience on the website.
Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the website.
Web beacons (also called "pixel tags") are small strings of code placed on a web page or within an email for the purpose of transferring information.
We and the web analytics provider that we use to help manage our Internet business and communications employ cookies and web beacons placed on pages of our website and in email to deliver our ads, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, and to learn how customers use our website.
The type of information that we collect through this technology includes the price, quantity and product id of the products viewed by the customer, the unique user id, the areas of the website viewed by the customer and certain personally identifiable information relating to the customer.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things such as what kinds of customers our website attract, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although our web analytics provider logs the information coming from our website on our behalf, we control how that data is in fact used.
Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open and are deleted once your browser session ends.
We use session cookies to complete your purchase transaction.
On the other hand, persistent cookies remain on your hard drive after your browser session ends.
We use persistent cookies to improve your overall website experience.
The cookies set by Saks transmit information back to our computers and are the only computers which are authorized to read such information.
The information captured makes it possible for us: (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the website; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing e-mail campaigns and advertising; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served.
Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit our website or most other websites because web browsers are typically set to automatically accept cookies.
You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether.
You will still be able to browse our website and make purchases, but you will not be able to retrieve your saved account information without cookies.
Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected.
In addition to web beacons and cookies discussed above, we may utilize 3rd party tracking pixels and cookies to help manage online advertising.
These pixels are provided by our advertising delivery partners.
These pixels enable our partners to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website as well as provide you with targeted advertisements.
In addition, our advertising delivery partners may place a 3rd party cookie on your computer as you browse the Website.
The information we collect and share in connection with these 3rd party tracking pixels and cookies is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
Currently, we provide 3rd party tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partner: DoubleClick.
In addition, we may at some point in the future engage other advertising delivery partners.
