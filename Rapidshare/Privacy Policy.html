<p>MD5 checksum of the uploaded file</p>
<p>There is a program, which calculates the MD5 checksum for each file immediately after the upload.
The MD5 checksum is a 16 bytes value that is always the same when calculated for the same file.
This value is stored in connection with the file.
If you upload and distribute files , we will delete the file upon notification and add the MD5 checksum to a blacklist, so the same file cannot be uploaded again.</p>

<li>timestamp of the upload</li>
