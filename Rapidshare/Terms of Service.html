Reseller <ol>
<li>

RapidShare shall not process any requests for support which relate to a payment transaction with a reseller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, RapidShare points out that there are various people and companies who are not authorised resellers who nevertheless claim to be selling Rapids for RapidShare.
RapidShare reserves the right to block accounts for which Rapids have been acquired through unauthorised resellers.
RapidShare cannot provide refunds for payments made to unauthorised third parties.</p>
