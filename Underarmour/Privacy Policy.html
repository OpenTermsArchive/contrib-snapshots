Last revised: August 1, 2014 INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to ua.com, Under Armour’s shopping website (“Under Armour Shopping”).
This Privacy Statement applies to all personal information and location information we collect or acquire about you through Under Armour Shopping or Under Armour Connected Fitness (described below)(collectively, the “Services”) and through any other media channels and platforms, whether online, offline, print, telephonic, mobile, wireless, or otherwise, whether collected or acquired by Under Armour, Inc.
(“Under Armour”) MapMyFitness, Inc.
(“MapMyFitness”) or any other Under Armour subsidiary or affiliate.
Certain products, services, and promotional offers made available by Under Armour and/or MapMyFitness may contain links to additional or different privacy terms.
For example, non-U.S.-based Under Armour or MapMyFitness web and mobile products and services may employ privacy terms that differ from those in this Privacy Statement.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and such additional or different privacy terms, the additional or different privacy terms will apply.
<br>
<br>
Under Armour recently acquired MapMyFitness and together we’re bringing you the Under Armour Connected Fitness suite, which includes all Under Armour and MapMyFitness branded web and mobile fitness products and services.
You can connect to the full suite of Under Armour Connected Fitness products and services through a single point of sign-on—your UA Account.
Additionally, you will soon be able to use your UA Account to log in to Under Armour Shopping.

<br>
<br>
Under Armour Connected Fitness is made available to you (individually, “you,” and collectively, “users”) by Under Armour and MapMyFitness, a wholly owned subsidiary of Under Armour (collectively, both Under Armour and MapMyFitness may be referred to as “We,” “we,” “Our,” or “our”).<br>
<br>
We have posted this Privacy Statement to let you know what kind of information we collect when you interact with the Services, the purposes for which we collect and use your information, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information.
<br>
<br>
Any capitalized but undefined terms used in this Privacy Statement have the same meaning as when used in the Terms.
<br>
<br>
As we continue to develop our Services and take advantage of advances in technology, our Privacy Statement may change.
Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.
WHAT TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?
We collect information about you when you register to use our Services, connect your social media account, use our Services, or communicate with us.

By using our Services, you grant us permission to process your personal information in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Statement.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information.</strong> When you sign up for a particular Service that requires registration or an account (collectively, any type of account you may create through Under Armour or MapMyFitness is referred to in the Terms and this Privacy Statement as “Account”), we ask you to submit certain personal information.

<br> You may use Under Armour Shopping without registering an account.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Social Media Connection.</strong> You may choose to enable or log in to the Services via various social media or social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Services”).
By integrating these Social Networking Services into our Services, we can offer you a richer and more personalized experience with our products and services.
When you connect your Account to a social media account, we collect certain personal information that you have provided to that Social Networking Service.
For example, when you log in with your Facebook credentials, we may collect personal information from your Facebook profile, such as your email address, profile picture, and friend list.<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment Method Information.</strong>For certain Services, we request that you furnish certain financial information, including but not limited to, credit card or other payment account information.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> Some Under Armour Connected Fitness Services use location-based components.
To provide these features, we or our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location information, including the real-time geographic location of your mobile device.
For some third-party partners, such as Google, this location information may be shared automatically.
For others, such as Facebook, location information will only be shared with your explicit permission or if you choose to share it via the device.
Location information includes, but is not limited to, any information we derive in order to identify your geographic position.
This information may be collected from your wireless carrier, certain third party service providers, or directly from the mobile device with which you use or access our Services.
The collection and tracking of your location information may occur even when our Services, including any mobile application, are not actively open and running.
Your location information, however, is only displayed and shared in accordance with your established privacy settings.<br>
<br>
We may combine the personal information and/or the location information that you provide via your Account with information from other Services or third parties in order to enhance your experience and/or to improve the overall quality of the Services.
For certain Services, we may give you an opportunity to opt out of the combination of such information.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Other Information You Provide.
</strong> When you employ our Services, we may receive certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Services.
Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or via submission of data by devices you may have configured to work with the Services, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
We may store such information ourselves, or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our respective affiliates, agents, and/or service providers.
We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Services, the number of visitors to each page of the Services, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers.
No personal information is available or used in this process.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information From Other Sources.</strong> If you have created an Account with us, we may obtain certain demographic information about you from reputable third party sources to help us improve our communication with you and improve our business overall.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Aggregated Information.</strong> To better serve you and improve the Services, we may conduct research on demographics, interests, and behavior based on personal information and other information provided via the Services.
This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated information with our affiliates, agents, and business partners.
This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
We may also disclose aggregated information in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies.
</strong>When you access or use the Services, we and third parties that provide certain functionality on our Services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and ad networks, may engage, receive, collect, and store certain types of information through automatic data collection tools including cookies, pixel tags, Web beacons, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information gathering tools (“Automatic Data Collection Tools”).
These Automatic Data Collection Tools collect certain information including, but not limited to, information such as your web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and elements employed in the Mobile Applications.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
<i>Cookies.</i>
</strong> A “cookie” is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive.
It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) when you visit one of the Services by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other user information you have provided us.
That user information is stored on our secured database.
Some cookies will remain on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device for the duration of your browsing session, while others will remain for longer periods of time or will remain unless and until deleted by you.
You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies (other than Flash cookies) or notify you when a cookie is set.
Each browser is different, so please check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
Please note that some of our Services or features may not function properly or at all if cookies are disabled or blocked.
<br>
<br>
Some third party service providers may use “Flash cookies,” also known as Local Shared Objects or LSOs.
Flash cookies are saved on your computer in the same way as other cookies, but they cannot be rejected, disabled, turned off, opted out of, or deleted in the same way as regular cookies.
For information on how to manage and remove Flash cookies, please visit: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html or epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
<i>Pixel Tags.</i>
</strong> “Pixel tags” (also known as “tracking pixels” or “web beacons”) are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Services.
The use of pixel tags is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears.
the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears.
the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed.
the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag.
and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
One of the ways in which we use pixel tags is through a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.
They may collect anonymous (other than your IP address) information about your visits to and interaction with our Services.
They may also use this information about your visits to the Services and other websites and applications to target advertisements for goods and services.
If you would like more information about online marketing practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party service providers, please click www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

YOUR CHOICES
<b>UA Account Privacy Settings and Online Disclosures.</b> Certain Websites and Mobile Applications available through the Services come equipped with privacy settings for your profile and activities.
For these Websites and Mobile Applications, we provide you with three privacy setting options for your UA Account—“Public.
Share With Everyone,” “Friends.
Share With All My Friends,” and “Private.
Do Not Share.” These privacy settings control who can view your online disclosures, including but not limited to certain personal information, location information, and activity data.<br>
<br> The default UA Account privacy setting is “Friends.
Share With All My Friends.” The “Friends.
Share With All My Friends” privacy setting limits access to your online disclosures.
While you maintain a “Friends.
Share With All My Friends” privacy setting, only certain personal information—specifically, your username, first name, and first initial of your last name, and any profile picture associated with you—that you disclose and/or transmit to us via the Websites and/or Mobile Applications is disclosed or accessible to the public.
All other personal information, location information, and activity data that you disclose and/or transmit is only disclosed to and accessible by us and those persons who you have designated as “Friends.”<br>
<br> A “Private.
Do Not Share” privacy setting further limits access to the personal information, location information, and activity data that you disclose and/or transmit via the Websites and/or Mobile Applications.
Specifically, while you maintain a “Private.
Do Not Share” privacy setting, no personal information, location information, or activity data that you disclose and/or transmit to us is disclosed to or accessible by your Friends or the public.
It is only disclosed to and accessible by us.<br>
<br> To permit the public or any third parties, including other users of our Services, to view personal information, location information, and activity data, you must actively and specifically employ a “Public.
Share With Everyone” privacy setting.<br>
<br> When you record and log activities (e.g., routes, food, workouts) in connection with your use of the Services, you may be permitted to designate a privacy setting specific to those activities by selecting an icon that corresponds to one of the privacy settings —“Public.
Share With Everyone,” “Friends.
Share With All My Friends,” and “Private.
Do Not Share.” The privacy setting that you set for the logged activity at that time will apply only to that activity.<br>
<br> We recommend that you actively manage your privacy settings on an ongoing basis, so that you can effectively guard against the unauthorized use or misuse of your personal information or location information by others.
HOW DO WE USE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS? <b>Purposes for Which Automatic Data Collection Tools are Used:</b> We use Automatic Data Collection Tools to: <br>

For example, there may be separate products and services offered by third parties advertised on or through our Services that may be complementary to your use of our Services.

Privacy policies and practices for such linked sites may differ from this Privacy Statement and our practices.
Your access and use of such linked sites is entirely and solely at your own risk.
We urge you to read the privacy policies of such linked sites before disclosing your personal information on such sites.
THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS:
You may be able to access certain third party applications or content (collectively, “Third Party Applications”) via your UA Account.
If you choose to access these Third Party Applications, you may be requested to log-in and sync your UA Account with such applications.
You are in no way obligated to use any Third Party Applications, and your access and use of such applications is entirely and solely at your own risk.

WHAT ARE OUR SECURITY POLICIES?
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology for internet transmission of your personal information.
When the letters “http” in the URL change to “https,” the “s” indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL.
also, your browser may give a pop-up message stating that you are about to enter or leave a secure area.
Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the Internet.
When you see VeriSign's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted via our secure servers.<br>
<br> Ultimately, if you register an Account, your Account and personal information is protected by the password you provided when you created your Account or updated your password while logged into your Account.
Always keep this password and login information private and never share it with anyone.
Also, remember to sign off your Account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your Account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.<br>
<br> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure.
Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our Services.
We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us.
