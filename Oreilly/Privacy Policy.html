<p>Please note that your objection to processing (or withdrawal of any previously given consent) could mean that we are unable to provide you with our services.
Even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent we may continue to process your personal information when required or permitted by law, in particular in connection with exercising and defending our legal rights, or meeting our legal and regulatory obligations.</p> 6.3 What we need from you to process your requests <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and to enable you to exercise the rights set out above.
