We may, from time to time in emails, alerts or other mailings you have agreed to accept from us, include advertisements, sponsorships, other offers from or information about third parties.

You may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available.
If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Sites may not operate as intended.
