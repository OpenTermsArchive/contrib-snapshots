We will post those changes on the website or update the Privacy Policy modification date.
In certain cases, and if the changes are material, you will be notified via email or a notice on our website.</p>
<blockquote>
IV.    The Information We Collect
</blockquote>
<p>We may ask you to provide personal information at various times and places on this website.
In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access the entire website or participate in all of its features.

</ul>
<p>We may collect the following personal information:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>When you register with us as an online customer, you have the option of providing additional information, such as your favorite designers.
During registration of your customer account, we process your personal data in order to finalize the order process, as well as customize your personal shopping experience.
Your data will be transmitted to third parties for certain purposes, for example, to complete your current order or to third parties who assist Neiman Marcus with its marketing efforts, subject to applicable data privacy laws.</p>
<p>We are located in the United States.
Where you are located in the EEA and the United Kingdom, and provide your personal data to us to place an order online or to subscribe to receive marketing emails from us, your personal data will be transferred to us and may be transferred to the above-mentioned recipients in other jurisdictions which may not have data privacy laws equivalent to those in the EEA or the United Kingdom.
By providing your personal data to us, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to us and other recipients described in this policy that are in countries outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom.
You may withdraw your consent at any time.
The withdrawal of your consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p>For customers based in the United States, when you visit this website, whether or not you are logged in or enter any personal information, our web server automatically collects information such as log data and IP addresses, and may collect general information concerning your location.
For EEA and UK customers, such information is collected only where we have obtained your consent to do so.
We may use this collected information for a number of purposes, such as improving our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.</p>
<p>When you visit one of our stores and elect to be connected to our wireless network, we may automatically collect information about your geo-location based, in part, upon which wireless network has been accessed.
When this happens we de-identify the information, which means that we remove or change (e.g., hash) certain pieces of information that might be used to link the data to you, or to your device.
We will not attempt to re-identify geo-location information (i.e., link it to you or your device) unless you affirmatively give us permission to collect geo-location information about you.
If you give us such permission, you can later decide to opt-out.</p>
<p>To disable geo-location on your mobile device, open your Settings app, and tap Privacy.
Then, tap on Location Services.
Scroll down until you see the "NM" app and tap on the toggle on the right-hand side so that the toggle is no longer green.</p>
<p>Our mobile applications will not transmit geo-location information about you to us unless you give them permission to do so.</p>
<p>Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online.
At this time, we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.</p>

You may also email storeemailoptout@NeimanMarcus.com.</p>
<p>These requests may also be made by calling our toll-free number: 1.866.908.1192.</p>
<p>Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes.
We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.</p>

<blockquote>
VIII.    Personal Information of Minors
</blockquote>
<p>Protecting children's privacy is important to us.
Our website is a general audience site.
We do not knowingly collect or maintain or sell Personal Information from those we actually know are under 13 and no part of our website is targeted to attract anyone under 13.
If the minor is less than 13 years old, we will obtain authorization from a parent or guardian.
If the minor is between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, we will obtain authorization from the minor.
</p>
<p>Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online.
We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.
</p>
<blockquote>
VIII.    How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure
</blockquote>
<p>We implement and maintain reasonable security appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process.
Our reasonable security program is implemented and maintained in accordance with applicable law and relevant standards as outlined in the report issued by the California Attorney General in February 2016, available at https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf.
Specifically, among other safeguards, our reasonable security program implements and maintains all 20 of the Center for Internet Security's Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense identified in Appendix A of the California Attorney General Report.
As noted in that report, "there is no perfect security," and reasonable security is a process that involves risk management rather than risk elimination.
While we are committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring and updating a reasonable information security program, no such program can be perfect.
in other words, all risk cannot reasonably be eliminated.
Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented.
Accordingly, while our reasonable security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.</p>
<blockquote>
X.    Changes to This Policy
</blockquote>
<p>We will review and update this Policy as required to keep current with rules and regulations, new technologies and security standards.
We will post those changes on the website or update the Privacy Policy modification date below.
In certain cases and if the changes are material, you will be notified via email or a notice on our website.

<li> Security Against Fraud <p>It should come as no surprise that one of our highest priorities at The Neiman Marcus Group is keeping your personal information secure and confidential.
To that end, we would like to share some of the most common types of internet scams and suggestions on how you can be aware of and help protect yourself against identity theft.</p> Fictitious Job Offer Emails Alert <p>Email campaigns offering fictitious job offers are a reality.
The emails can be quite authentic looking.
They often purport to have been sent directly from one of our executives or from our human resources department.
Enclosures, such as company information sheets and detailed questionnaires, may display The Neiman Marcus Group logo or the logo of one of our divisions (Neiman Marcus, Horchow, Cusp, Last Call, or Bergdorf Goodman).
The emails may include a request for payment of a processing fee of several hundred dollars, and/or they may offer reimbursement for certain job-application or relocation expenses.</p>
<p>These emails are fraudulent.
The Neiman Marcus Group does not extend job offers via email to individuals with whom it has had no prior contact.
We do not ask prospective employees to pay a fee to be considered for a position or to receive a job offer.
We do not authorize recruiters or agents to do any of these things on our behalf.
Fraudulent job offers are an unfortunate possibility.
Please be aware, as we will not honor them in any way.</p>
<p>You should not respond to any of these job offers by revealing personal information, nor should you send any funds in response to them.
If you receive one of these fraudulent offers, please report the matter to the U.S.
Secret Service.
You may also email our security group.</p> Phishing and Spoofing Alert <p>This is when a criminal sends you a phony message or a website link that appears to be from a legitimate business.
They will directly request that you provide personal financial information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and address</li>
<li>Social Security numbers</li>
<li>Credit card numbers/bank account numbers</li>
<li>PIN numbers/passwords</li>
</ul>Pop-Up Advertisements Alert <p>Some advertisements "pop up" in a separate browser window advising that you have won a contest or request that you participate in a survey to collect a prize.
They may then ask that you provide personal information in order to receive your gift.
By clicking on the link it is possible that you are also downloading viruses designed to capture or destroy information on your computer.</p> Check Scam Alert <p>A similar but low-tech scam circulates occasionally, in the form of a check, purportedly from The Neiman Marcus Group LLC or one of our divisions, and instructions to deposit it right away, usually in order to receive the balance of a larger sum you have "won" or that has otherwise come to you unexpectedly.
You will be instructed to immediately send a payment, in the form of a second personal check, wire transfer, or similar, to some third party to cover taxes, processing fees, administrative costs, or some similarly vague expense.
The check you receive in the mail likely would look quite authentic and probably would have our Neiman Marcus Group trademark on it.
Do not deposit the check or follow the instructions you receive with it.
The check you deposit will bounce.
the check you write or funds you wire will clear, before you know about the bounce, and certainly before you can stop payment on your own check.</p> Important Risk-Reducing Tips <ul>
<li>Never respond to emails that cannot be verified.</li>
<li>Never provide personal information via email.</li>
<li>Contact the business by using legitimate phone numbers to verify the request.</li>
<li>Enter websites using your browser and not by clicking on provided links.</li>
<li>Be cautious of any solicitation requesting that you deposit a check or pay a fee to collect a prize, get a job, or cover vaguely described "costs".</li>
<li>Consider filing a report with the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorney general's consumer protection office, or the FBI.
Online complaints may be filed with the FTC at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov, and white collar crimes may be reported to the FBI at www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx.</li>
