This Privacy Policy describes what information the Site collect from users, including children, when they visit the Site; how such information is used and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and disclosure of collected information; and how information is protected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our visitors' privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the Site permitting such visitors. Our privacy practices are guided by the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as data privacy laws in the United States and other applicable countries. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information.

				Addicting Games, Inc. ("AG") is committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our network of websites and applications (collectively, the "Site"). In order to do so, we may gather certain information about you. Please read the following policy ("policy") to understand how certain of your information collected on the Site will be collected, used, shared, and retained.

						<p>
							When you visit the Site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. (See the "Behavioral advertising" section below for more information on certain third parties who may also collect similar information when you visit the Site for online behavioral advertising purposes.) This includes which pages are visited, which advertisements are viewed, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. For purposes of clarity, unless visitors submit personal information directly to us (e.g.: by means of a site registration, in connection with a contest, etc.), our sites do not collect visitor's personal information. Additional information on how we treat personal information that is submitted directly to us and how such information may be shared may be found in our privacy policy.

						<p>
							We analyze non-personal information that we collect on the Site, or obtain from third parties, and organize it into anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests, and online actions. We and our clients and partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (for example, to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date or social security number. Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you visit any of the Site and view ads from AG's advertisers, AG automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personal information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered. While each advertising technology uses different types of technology to collect this information, including log files, cookies, and pixels, none of the foregoing by itself or together can be tracked to a specific individual's personal information, and the non-personal information collected by AG will not be shared with third parties, except as expressly indicated in this policy. The non-personal information collected through your use of the Site is used to provide relevant, targeted advertising and improve AG's advertising technology; monitor website traffic; collect statistical data; determine the effectiveness of advertisements and content; and collect data across multiple websites to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in online behavioral advertising. AG may track visits to the Site and this information may be used over time to help predict your consumer interest segments and select the ad content you see. AG may also use non-personally identifiable profile-based anonymous information with other non-personal information.
						</p>
						<p>
							AG does not create or use potentially sensitive data segments to provide its targeted online behavioral advertising for advertisers, including, but not limited to, health related audience segments.

							The Site may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services. A "web beacon" is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us, so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. By showing us how and when visitors use the Site, "cookies" and "web beacons" allow us to see which AG Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior. In addition, "cookies" will allow us to display in your profile which AG and affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies." We do not control these "cookies." You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use "cookies."
						</p>
						<p>
							Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies." If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies." You will not be able to fully use the Site if you turn off the "cookies" option.

By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our privacy policy.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>How We Use Your Personal Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We use your personal information to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications and to get in touch with you when necessary. For example, we may use your personal information to communicate with you or to send you information that you have requested. Except as otherwise set forth on the Site, in addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey. We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share personal information provided online with AG Affiliates. Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences. For example, a family company may send to you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products or services that it thinks might be of interest to you. A family company may also contact you offline. If you want to opt-out from our (or a family company) using the personal information you provided in these ways, please <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a>. Please include documents that prove your identity and a clear and precise description of the manner in which you'd like to opt-out.
			</p>
			<p>
				From time to time, we may present you with opportunities to participate in special, limited, or unique promotions, like sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, surveys, and other similar offers (each, a âSpecial Opportunityâ) through the Site. A Special Opportunity may be governed by a privacy policy and/or terms and conditions that are additional to and/or separate from this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. If the provisions of the Special Opportunity's privacy policy or terms and conditions conflict with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, those additional or separate provisions will control and prevail. If you participate in a Special Opportunity, we may ask you for certain information in addition to what is stated in this Privacy Policy, including personal information. That additional information may be combined with other account information and may be used and shared as described in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Updating or Removing Your Personal Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Please <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a> at any time to update or change your personal information. Please include documents that prove your identity and a clear and precise description of the information to which you request access.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We will not share with third parties the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with other persons, service providers or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make material changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). As stated above, we do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy and may also share personal information provided online with AG Affiliates. Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to an Affiliate, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information among AG Affiliates, please <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a>. Please include documents that prove your identity and a clear and precise description of the manner in which you'd like to opt-out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third-party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. We will seek to obtain your consent either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third-party service providers. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information with these companies, please <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a>. Please include documents that prove your identity and a clear and precise description of the manner in which you'd like to opt-out. If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Personal Information Gathered Under Previous Versions of This Privacy Policy.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Personal information collected via the Site will generally be governed by the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was gathered. We will not retroactively make material changes to the way we use personally identifiable information collected under previous versions of this Privacy Policy without obtaining your consent.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We sometimes use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including Affiliates and non-affiliated companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Receipt of Communications; Opt-Out.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications - <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a> to (i) deregister your account; or (ii) change or edit your preferences. You may also use the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an email.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional postal mail from us, please <a target="_blank" href="https://shockwavehelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">CONTACT US</a> or let us know in writing via letter addressed to: Attn: Privacy, Addicting Games, Inc. 366 5th Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10001.

				Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our Affiliates, may continue to contact you via email or postal mail for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or sweepstakes you have participated in or have entered, goods, services or products you have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken on the Site.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Collection of Information by Others.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Site may contain links to other websites, including links that are placed there by us, such as third-party advertisements or text hyperlinks. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all users of the Site to be aware of when they leave the Site, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Site, through the Site. We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personal information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Online Tracking and Advertising.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We collect information regarding the Site visitors through various technologies, such as cookies, Flash cookies and Web beacons, including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms. Please visit our <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/privacy-policy.jsp" target="_blank" >Privacy Policy</a> for further information regarding this collection and usage, including how to disable cookies.

				<strong>Clickstream Data.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "Clickstream Data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve the Site. Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregate.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Supplementing Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Discussions and Community Tools.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups, and other community tools available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Our Commitment to Security.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. Whenever personal information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, guarantee that they do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notice to California-Based Users.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to the Site about how we have shared your personal information during the prior calendar year with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

For purposes of this California Privacy notice, third parties include companies within our "family" of companies, such as AG Affiliates.

				The California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how the Site responds to âDo Not Trackâ browser settings. The Site does not currently take action to respond to Do Not Track signals, as a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed and we do not respond to such signals. We continue to review new technologies and reserve the right to adopt a standard once one is created.

				<strong>The General Data Protection Regulation</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				A new European Union law, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR", gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Transfer of Business Assets.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if the Site, we, or parent(s) or any or all of Affiliates or any of our assets are ever acquired by a third party.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Changes to this Policy.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Because our business needs may change over time, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. If at any time in the future we plan to use your personal information in a way that differs from this policy, we will revise this policy as appropriate. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes. This policy is effective as of May 25, 2018.
