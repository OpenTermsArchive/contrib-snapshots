<p>
			    <strong>1. REGISTRATION AND USE OF PASSWORD</strong>
			</p>
<p>
			    We may require each user to have a unique user name and password combination in order to use the Site and may also, from time to time, provide users with additional codes or passwords necessary to access and use certain features or functions of the Site. Please read our <a href="https://www.shockwave.com/about/privacyPolicy.jsp"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a>, which describes the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") we collect, use, disclose, manage and store. As part of the registration process, you will choose a user name and password (or we	may assign an initial password which we will give you the option to change). For users that choose to access Shockwave UNLIMITED with prizes via an <a href="https://www.shockwave.com/tokenCentral/rules.jsp#entryLink"><strong>alternate means of entry</strong></a> (if any), we will assign a user name and password. Your user name and password are personal to you and you may not allow any others to use them under any circumstances.

You agree to notify us immediately if you become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns.
			</p>
<p>
			    PASSWORDS ARE ISSUED ON A PERSONAL BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, ALL CONTENT OR INSTRUCTIONS TRANSMITTED BY OR RECEIVED FROM ANYONE PRESENTING YOUR PASSWORD ON THE SITE WILL BE DEEMED BINDING ON YOU. You agree that you are solely responsible and liable for all actions taken via your password, whether or not made with your knowledge or authority.

			</p>
<p>
			    In consideration of your use of the Site (and/or software or Services purchased through the Site) you agree to provide true, accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site registration or ordering process, provided that in connection with registration, you do not need to, and should not, use your full or true name for your screen name or username. Additionally, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and you agree to update information provided in connection with registration or the ordering process in order to maintain its truth, accuracy and completeness.
			</p>

			    <strong>2. GAME DOWNLOAD PAYMENTS AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CONSENT TO CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION</strong>
			</p>
<p>
			    When purchasing game downloads on the Site, you agree to pay us the applicable download charges for your purchase of the game, using a valid charge card or other payment method we may accept in accordance with the billing terms and prices in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. All refund requests for purchased game downloads must be received within 48 hours from the time of purchase. Refund requests past 48 hours from time of purchase will not be honored.
			</p>
<p>
			    By creating a Site subscription you authorize the Site to automatically bill the charge card you provide each month or on each applicable membership period renewal date, or withdraw funds via electronic transfer from your checking account (depending on what type of charge card you are using), until you cancel the subscription. Payments are billed in advance at the beginning of the applicable month or at the beginning of the applicable subscription period, if not monthly. All payments are completely non-refundable.
			</p>
<p>
			    When submitting information to purchase a subscription service on this Site, you agree to our credit card authorization policy, in which we issue a small temporary authorization charge to validate your credit card account. This policy helps protect you against credit card fraud and will not result in a charge to your account, though it may temporarily appear as a pending charge on some bank statements.
			</p>

			    The Site may offer users points ("Tokens") for participating in certain Site activities such as achieving certain game scores, playing certain games, etc. The Site may also offer to users who have completed or excelled at specified Site activities or games trophies, virtual awards or achievement symbols ("Trophies"). Trophies have no monetary value and can only be used to participate in activities within the Site.

Except as permitted by the functionality of this Site, you can't sell Tokens or Trophies or give them to anyone, trade them for anything (including Tokens), or pretend you made them. This means that you cannot try to make money off the Tokens, Trophies, or virtual items in your account or even sell the time it took you to collect such items and Tokens. If we find someone selling Tokens, Trophies, or other virtual items, we will freeze every account controlled by that user and every account of the user who purchased such Tokens, Trophies or virtual items.
			</p>
<p>
			    You acknowledge and agree that you are not permitted under any circumstances or for any reason to cheat or utilize third-party games or code in order to win at, or gain Tokens or Trophies from any game or activity on the Site. You agree not to design, disseminate or use any third party programs designed to change the game play or Token or Trophy providing activities on the site including, but without limitations, programs such as autobuyers, flash game cheats, autofreshers, and snipers.
