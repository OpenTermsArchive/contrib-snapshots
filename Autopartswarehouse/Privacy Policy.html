<p>
<b>Autopartswarehouse.com</b> has no access to or control over these third party cookies and does not gain access to any of your information collected by Google nor does it share any of your personally identifiable information such as your name, telephone number, email, and home address with the Google Display Network of sites unless the site or <b>Autopartswarehouse.com</b> otherwise notifies you.</p>

Alternatively, you may also choose to opt out of receiving cookies from other third party ad servers simultaneously through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-out Tool.</p>
<p>
<b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> occasionally enters into cooperative marketing arrangements with independent companies.
Under these cooperative marketing arrangements, our site may display the name and/or brand(s) of the independent company.
Personally identifiable information that you supply to us while you are on our site, whether or not our site displays a name or brand of another company, will be handled in accordance with this <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> Privacy Policy and will not be shared with the cooperative marketing company unless <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> otherwise notifies you.</p>
<p>
<b>Use of Information:</b>
</p>
<p>To carry out certain business functions, such as order fulfillment or e-mail delivery, we sometimes hire other companies to perform these functions on our behalf.
These companies have access to the information needed to perform their functions, but are required to keep it secure and confidential and not use it for any other purpose than completing their contractual requirements to <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b>.
As a part of the normal process of completing your purchase, <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> may provide your personal data to a third party payment processor, depending on your chosen method of payment.
</p>
<p>Any credit card or similar payment information you submit is used in billing for the specific transaction in which the information was submitted unless otherwise disclosed.
Payment information is stored for a time on our secure servers to allow the processing of refunds or to respond to customer inquiries.
Immediately after the completion of your <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> online transaction, you may be presented with an opportunity to purchase third party products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
These products and services are offered by, and would be supplied by, independent companies not owned or operated by <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b>.
If you select one of the presented offers, you will be redirected to the site of the third party.
Information you provide to the third party and any dealings you have with the third party will be governed by the privacy and other policies of that third party.
We will not provide your credit card or other payment details to a third party in connection with one of these offers unless you indicate to us that we are authorized to do so.</p>
<p>From time-to-time <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.
If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
<p>
<b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> may use aggregate, non-personally identifying information for purposes that we deem necessary.
For instance, we will use this non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and to share with advertisers for marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these instances we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify you.
We do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described herein without providing you an opportunity to opt-out of such operations.</p>
<p>It is possible that in the future <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> or its assets may be acquired by another company.
It is also possible that <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business as a combined entity.
In the event that this occurs, it is possible that our customer information may be transferred to the new business entity as one of <b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> assets.
In such an event, we will update this policy to notify you of such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<p>
<b>Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection:</b>
</p>
<p>We may collect and disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
We may collect and possibly share personally identifiable information and any other information available to us in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any personal or as otherwise required by law.
We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.</p>
<p>
<b>Secure Encryption</b>
</p>
<p>We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers.
SSL works best when you are using the latest 128-bit encryption version of Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet.
It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.</p>
<p>
<b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> minimum requirement for transactions is the standard 40-bit or 56-bit encryption supported by the Internet Explorer 5.0 browser.
If you are not using this browser, please refer to your browser's documentation for information on its security features.</p>
<p>We transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.</p>
<p>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</b>
</p>
<p>This privacy policy was last modified on 10/26/2007.</p>
<p>
<b>AutoPartsWarehouse.com</b> may revise this policy from time to time.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
<b>Credit Card Security</b>
<p> The AutoPartsWarehouse Security Guarantee protects you while you shop at AutoPartsWarehouse so you never have to worry about credit card safety.

This ensures that only AutoPartsWarehouse can read your personal information.

We will, however, transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
