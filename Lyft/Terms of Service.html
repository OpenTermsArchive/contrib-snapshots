                    <p>Last Updated: April 1, 2021</p>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the &#x201C;Agreement&#x201D;) between you and
                        Lyft, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors
                        (collectively, &#x201C;Lyft,&#x201D; &#x201C;we,&#x201D; &#x201C;us&#x201D; or &#x201C;our&#x201D;) governing your use of the Lyft application (the
                        &#x201C;Lyft App&#x201D;), website, and technology platform (collectively, the &#x201C;Lyft Platform&#x201D;).
                    </p>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                        Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims between you and
                        Lyft can be brought (<a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">see Section 17 below</a>). These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against
                        Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member
                        in any class, group or representative action or proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you
                        have an opportunity to opt out of arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in
                        Section 17.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft Platform you expressly
                        acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration
                        provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                        <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may not
                            use or access the Lyft Platform or any of the services provided through the Lyft
                            Platform.</span>
                        If you use the Lyft Platform in another country, you agree to be subject to Lyft&apos;s terms of
                        service for that country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using the Lyft Platform, you also agree to conduct yourself in accordance with our
                        <a href="https://www.lyft.com/safety/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, which shall
                        form part of this Agreement between you and Lyft.

                        The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek
                        transportation to certain destinations (&#x201C;Riders&#x201D;) can be matched with transportation options to
                        such destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are
                        driving to or through those destinations (&#x201C;Drivers&#x201D;). Drivers and Riders are collectively
                        referred to herein as &#x201C;Users,&#x201D; and the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders shall be
                        referred to herein as &#x201C;Rideshare Services.&#x201D; As a User, you authorize Lyft to match you with
                        Drivers or Riders based on factors such as your location, the requested pickup location, the
                        estimated time to pickup, your destination, User preferences, driver mode, and platform
                        efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and/or rematch you with a Driver or Rider based on
                        the same considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a
                        decision made in such User&#x2019;s sole discretion. Each Rideshare Service provided by a Driver to a
                        Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the Lyft
                        Platform to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters are owned by
                        Lyft. In other markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share program on behalf of third
                        parties. In either case, your rental and use of bikes and scooters through the Lyft Platform is
                        subject to additional agreements between you and Lyft and third parties as applicable to the
                        particular market (&#x201C;Supplemental Agreements&#x201D;). Please review any applicable Supplemental
                        Agreements carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A
                        SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT RENT OR USE THE BIKES OR SCOOTERS IN SUCH MARKET. In the
                        event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental
                        Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

                        minor you may create a Lyft account for such minor to use the Lyft Platform subject to the
                        following requirements and restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor&#x2019;s use of the Lyft
                        Platform is limited solely to accessing and using bike-share or scooter-share services where
                        expressly permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such services, (b) you
                        determine that the bike-share and scooter-share services are suitable for the minor, (c) you
                        ensure that the minor&#x2019;s use of the Lyft Platform and applicable bike-share or scooter-share
                        services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and

                    <h2>Charges</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a Rider, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services may result in charges to
                        you (&#x201C;Charges&#x201D;). Charges related to bikes and scooters are addressed in the applicable
                        Supplemental Agreement. Charges for Rideshare Services include Fares and other applicable fees,
                        tolls, surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">www.lyft.com/cities</a>), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the
                        right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market&#x2019;s Lyft
                        Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a request. Pricing
                        may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., shared, economy, extra seats, luxury)
                        as described on your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable
                        Lyft Cities page or price quote within the Lyft App and shall be responsible for all Charges
                        incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts
                        thereof.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fares. There are two types of Fares, variable and quoted.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Variable Fares</strong>. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental
                            charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For particularly short rides,
                            minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver&#x2019;s phone to
                            calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or
                            accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal we will calculate time and distance using available
                            data from your ride.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Quoted Fares</strong>. In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the time of your
                            request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is confirmed. If during your
                            ride you change your destination, make multiple stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft
                            Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and charge you a variable fare based on the time and
                            distance of your ride. Lyft does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a
                            variable fare for the same ride. Quoted Fares may include the Fees and Other Charges below,
                            as applicable.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Service Fee</strong>. You may be charged a &#x201C;Service Fee&#x201D; for each ride as set forth
                            on the applicable Lyft Cities page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Prime Time</strong>. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare
                            Services (&#x201C;Prime Time&#x201D;), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all
                            rides with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime Time
                            increases in effect at the time of your request. For Quoted Fares we may factor in the Prime
                            Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the
                            Lyft App, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. You may also be
                            charged if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help Center to

                        <li>
                            <strong>Damage Fee</strong>. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the
                            Driver&apos;s vehicle, you agree to pay a &#x201C;Damage Fee&#x201D; of up to $250 depending on the extent of
                            the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or
                            cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require
                            documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Tolls</strong>. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to your ride.
                            Please see our Help Center and your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page for more
                            <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">

                            We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft will match the toll charged to the
                            Driver, if any.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Other Charges</strong>. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including:
                            actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, or event fees as determined by Lyft
                            or its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable
                            taxes. See your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page for details on other Charges that may apply to
                            your ride.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Tips</strong>. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in cash or through
                            the Lyft Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the
                            Lyft App. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Facilitation of Charges</strong>. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party
                            payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal,
                            Inc.). Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. Charges
                            shall only be made through the Lyft Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are
                            strictly prohibited. Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for
                            your use of the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services. Certain Charges may be collectively
                            billed as a single purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the payment
                            frequency indicated in your settings. If you don&apos;t recognize a transaction, then check your
                            ride receipts and payment history.

                        <li>
                            <strong>No Refunds</strong>. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall
                            apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Lyft Platform, any
                            disruption to the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services, or any other reason whatsoever.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Coupons</strong>. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward payment of
                            certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid for use on the Lyft
                            Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons
                            cannot be combined unless expressly provided otherwise, and if the cost of your ride exceeds
                            the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your payment method on file for the
                            outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount
                            attributable to the Service Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon.
                            Additional restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion
                            or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the Promotions section of the Lyft App.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment method or each
                            ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the
                            payment method, ensure the ride cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized
                            behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by

                        you, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with the terms and
                        conditions of this Agreement, a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the

                        Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation carrier. Lyft is
                        not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer
                        a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide
                        whether or not to accept a ride from any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot
                        ensure that a Driver or Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no
                        control over the quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the

                        to limit or eliminate access to the Lyft Platform for Rideshare Services in specific geographic
                        areas and/or at specific times based on commercial viability, public health concerns, or changes
                        in law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties
                        of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some states do

                        (a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Lyft.
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        YOU AND LYFT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT
                        OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below.
                        This agreement to arbitrate (&#x201C;Arbitration Agreement&#x201D;) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                        (&#x201C;FAA&#x201D;); but if the FAA is inapplicable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is
                        governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including Del. Code tit. 10, &#xA7; 5701 et seq.,
                        without regard to choice of law principles. This Arbitration Agreement survives after the
                        Agreement terminates or your relationship with Lyft ends. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
                        WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
                        Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Agreement applies to all Claims (defined
                        below) between you and Lyft, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and
                        assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or shareholders.
                        This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims between you and Lyft&#x2019;s service providers,
                        including but not limited to background check providers and payment processors; and such service
                        providers shall be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.

                    <p>
                        Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A &#x201C;CLAIM&#x201D; AND
                        COLLECTIVELY, &#x201C;CLAIMS&#x201D;) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION SOLELY BETWEEN YOU
                        AND LYFT. These Claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy,
                        whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement
                        and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or

                        goods or services made available through the Lyft Platform, your relationship with Lyft, the
                        threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User Account or this

                        state or federal wage-hour law, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest
                        periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation,

                        Lyft and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance),
                        and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other
                        federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of
                        a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or
                        validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly
                        provided below.

                    <p>
                        BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND LYFT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                        COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS
                        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every
                        claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by
                        the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to
                        arbitrate.

                        (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
                    </h5>

                    <p class="uppercase">
                        You understand and agree that you and Lyft may each bring Claims in arbitration against the
                        other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective action, or representative
                        basis (&#x201C;Class Action Waiver&#x201D;). You understand and agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the
                        right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
                        class, collective or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection
                        (b) shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought against Lyft,
                        which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).

                    <p>
                        The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on
                        any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or
                        resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The
                        arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
                        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&apos;s
                        individual claims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA
                        Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class
                        Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which:
                        (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a
                        final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any
                        Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief),
                        then that Claim or particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed
                        from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual
                        basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.

                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the
                        fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not to bring a representative action on
                        behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (&#x201C;PAGA&#x201D;), California Labor Code
                        &#xA7; 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                        attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft agree that any
                        such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve
                        whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such
                        an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or
                        collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject
                        to any violations of law) (collectively, &#x201C;representative PAGA Waiver&#x201D;). Notwithstanding any
                        other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes
                        regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this
                        representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and
                        not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                        unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from
                        this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on
                        the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an
                        individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA
                        or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court
                        of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be
                        litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent
                        jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to
                        those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                        outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

                        (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the
                        American Arbitration Association (&#x201C;AAA&#x201D;) pursuant to its
                        <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> that are in effect at the
                        time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies
                        of these rules can be obtained at the AAA&#x2019;s website (www.adr.org) (the &#x201C;AAA Rules&#x201D;).
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and
                        circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                        different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one
                        person&#x2019;s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class
                        proceeding. The parties may select a different arbitration administrator upon mutual written
                        agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery
                        of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator may award any
                        individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory
                        or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                        necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&apos;s individual claims. The arbitrator will
                        provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator&#x2019;s decision which shall explain the award
                        given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and
                        will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                        rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in
                        prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                        The arbitrator&#x2019;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the
                        arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may
                        be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.

                            the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the
                            filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in
                            the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                            be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any
                            dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
                            For purposes of this Section 17(e)(2), the term &#x201C;Driver&#x201D; shall be deemed to include both

                        This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1)
                        small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small
                        claims court&#x2019;s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA
                        or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section
                        17(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under
                        applicable law not preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers&#x2019; compensation, state disability
                        insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration
                        as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and (5) individual claims of

                        require arbitration of those claims. Lyft&apos;s agreement not to require arbitration of these claims
                        does not waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                        (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the enforceability

                        participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not
                        arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision or
                        settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Provision if
                        you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration

                        class, collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on
                        your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you
                        do agree to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you are
                        agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief,
                        against Lyft in an individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a
                        Pending Settlement Action. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or
                        seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                        collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your
                        choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you
                        exercise your right to assert claims or opt-out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration
                        Agreement.

                        (k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to first attempt to
                        negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless
                        this time period is mutually extended by you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation
                        under this subsection must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (&#x201C;Notice&#x201D;).
                        The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the
                        specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written,
                        made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and
                        attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence
                        of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                        provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered
                        inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.

                    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>
                        You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential
                        information relating to Lyft&#x2019;s business, operations and properties, information about a User
                        made available to you in connection with such User&#x2019;s use of the Platform, which may include the
                        User&#x2019;s name, pick-up location, contact information and photo (&#x201C;Confidential Information&#x201D;)
                        disclosed to you by Lyft for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein.
                        You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                        and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any User Information
                        obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some of Rider Information you
                        receive may be protected by federal and/or state confidentiality laws, such as the Health
                        Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#x201C;HIPAA&#x201D;), governing the privacy and
                        security of protected (patient) health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you
                        should not disclose to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you picked up, or
                        dropped off the Rider, as this could violate HIPAA. You understand that any violation of the
                        Agreement&#x2019;s confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality laws and could
                        result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to take all reasonable measures to
                        protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of Lyft in order
                        to prevent it from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have
                        liability to Lyft with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the
                        public domain at the time it was disclosed by Lyft or has entered the public domain through no
                        fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as
                        demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior
                        written approval of Lyft; becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than
                        Lyft without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Lyft&#x2019;s rights; or
                        is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                        governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such court order
                        or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or
                        restrict such disclosure.

                        that of independent contracting parties. You and Lyft expressly agree that (1) this is not an
                        employment agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and Lyft; and
                        (2) no joint venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or
                        created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind Lyft, and you undertake not to hold
                        yourself out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of Lyft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your
                        performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of
                        Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle.
                        You retain the sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will utilize the Lyft
                        Platform. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates,
                        times of day, or any minimum number of hours for you to utilize the Lyft Platform. You retain
                        the option to accept or to decline or ignore a Rider&#x2019;s request for Rideshare Services via the
                        Lyft Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft Platform,
                        subject to Lyft&#x2019;s then-current cancellation policies. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to,
                        require you to accept any specific request for Rideshare Services as a condition of maintaining
                        access to the platform. With the exception of any signage required by law or permit/license
                        rules or requirements, Lyft shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Lyft&#x2019;s names,
                        logos or colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying

                        In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable Users to provide or
                        receive services from other third parties. For example, Users may be able to use the Lyft
                        Platform to plan and reserve rides on public transportation, take a ride in an autonomous
                        vehicle provided by a third party, rent vehicles, or obtain financial services provided by third
                        parties (collectively, the &#x201C;Other Services&#x201D;). You understand that the Other Services are subject
                        to the terms and pricing of the third-party provider. If you choose to purchase Other Services
                        through the Lyft Platform, you authorize Lyft to charge your payment method on file according to
                        the pricing terms set by the third-party provider. You agree that Lyft is not responsible and
                        may not be held liable for the Other Services or the actions or omissions of the third-party
                        provider. Such Other Services may not be investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy,
                        appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Other Services
                        accessed through the Lyft Platform. This Agreement incorporates by reference
                        <a href="https://www.adt.com/about-adt/legal/mobile-monitoring-terms-lyft">ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms</a>. In the event of a conflict in the terms of the ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms and this

                        with Lyft herein, and the limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also
                        apply to ADT. The Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above
                        shall apply instead of any terms in the ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms for all purposes
                        except with respect to claims that are solely against ADT.

                        intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and is not intended to

                        whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes

                        <p>
                            <strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup.
                            The Lyft Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently
                            depending on your Lyft app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using
                            the platform as a Rider or Driver:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Riders: We collect your device&#x2019;s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                                including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride
                                until it ends. Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all
                                times.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Drivers: We collect your device&#x2019;s precise location when you open and use the app,
                                including while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also
                                collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to
                                detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident
                                is no longer active.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft
                            Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route,
                            payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information
                            about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps and websites, including the
                            pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to
                            access the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of
                            operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences
                            and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers,
                            advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect
                            mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration,
                            deceleration, and other technical data).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to
                            facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                            party&#x2019;s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the
                            communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the
                            participants&#x2019; phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For
                            security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through
                            the Lyft Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call
                            begins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft
                            access to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to
                            help you refer friends to Lyft. If you do this, we will access and store the names and
                            contact information of the people in your address book.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information

                            and interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what
                            content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites,
                            and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your

                            your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
                            disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your
                            browser and may be accessed every time you use the Lyft Platform. You should consult your

                    <p>
                        We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share
                        your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section
                        explains when and why we share your information.

                        <h3>A. Sharing Between Lyft Users</h3>
                        <p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with
                            the Driver the Rider&#x2019;s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like
                            approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in
                            their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share
                            with the Driver the Rider&#x2019;s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the
                            Lyft app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider&#x2019;s rating and
                            feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider&#x2019;s identity associated with ratings and
                            feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that
                            provided the rating or feedback.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we
                            will share with the Rider the Driver&#x2019;s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating,
                            real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other
                            information in the Driver&#x2019;s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like
                            country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and
                            years as a Driver).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do
                            not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you
                            report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                            Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each
                            Rider&#x2019;s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other&#x2019;s pickup
                            and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested
                            or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile
                            account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a
                            corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays
                            for a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party,
                            including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off
                            location of your ride.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let
                            them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share
                            information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral
                            source may receive a bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of
                            rides and would receive such information.

                    <p>
                        We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft
                        Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We
                        retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure
                        we can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you
                        request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the &#x201C;Deleting Your
                        Account&#x201D; section below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But
                        no security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your
                        information, including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.

                        access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other data rights that give you

                            messages) by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the

                            to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts you can text START in response to an unsubscribe

                            obligations. For example, we may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims,
                            or we may be obligated to retain your information as part of an open legal claim. When we
                            retain such data, we do so in ways designed to prevent its use for other purposes.
