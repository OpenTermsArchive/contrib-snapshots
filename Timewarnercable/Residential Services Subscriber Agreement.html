AGREE TO RESOLVE CERTAIN DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS PART OF THE AGREEMENT.
SEE SECTION 15.</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Capitalized terms used in this <b>Agreement </b>have special meanings, which are contained in Section 16.
By accepting our <b>Services</b>, you agree with <b>TWC</b> as follows:</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<b>1.
Your Financial Responsibilities</b>
<p>(a) You must pay for the <b>Services </b>you receive in accordance with our billing practices, along with any installation charges and other applicable fees and taxes.
 If you have any questions about our prices or fees, please contact your local <b>TWC </b>office.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) If you fail to pay us in full by the due date on your billing statement, we may require that you pay us the following additional amounts:</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>- a late fee;</p>
<p>- a field collection fee, if we accept payment at your home;</p>
<p>- amounts we spend, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to collect the money you owe us.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our late fee and field collection fee charges are available from your local <b>TWC</b> office.
You confirm that such fees are reasonable in light of our costs in collecting past due amounts.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) If we suspend any of your <b>Services </b>for failure to pay amounts you owe us or for violating our <b>Customer Agreements</b>, we may require that you pay us a fee for restoring your Service.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) If your check to us “bounces” (or if your bank or credit card issuer refuses to pay us amounts you have previously authorized us to charge to your account), we may require that you pay us a fee.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) We may verify your credit standing, <b>including </b>through credit reporting agencies.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(f) We may require a deposit or other guaranteed form of payment (for example, a credit card or bank account debit authorization) from you.
If you owe us money on any account, we can deduct those amounts from any existing credit you have with us or any security deposit you provide or, if applicable, charge them to the bank or credit card account you have authorized us to use.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(g) You authorize us to accept (and charge you for) any orders or requests made through your <b>Services </b>or from your location.
For example, if someone in your home makes a long distance Digital Home Phone call or requests a pay channel like HBO, you are responsible for the resulting charges.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(h) We are not required to notify you of offers we make available to others, or to lower your rates to equal those contained in such offers.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(i) You must bring any billing errors to our attention within 30 days of the day you receive the bill or you will waive your right to (in other words, you will not be eligible to receive) a refund or credit.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(j) Since tax and regulatory rules are subject to interpretation, we have complete discretion in deciding what fees, taxes and surcharges to collect from you.
You waive (in other words, you are not eligible to receive) a refund of any fees that we collect from you and pay to any government or agency.
You can receive a list of the fees, taxes and surcharges we collect from: Time Warner Cable, 7800 Crescent Executive Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28217.
Attention: Subscriber Tax Inquiries.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(k) You cannot settle amounts you owe us by writing “paid in full” or any other message on your bill or check.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(l) If you provide us with a credit or debit card for billing or deposit purposes and the issuer gives you a new card on the account with a different expiration date, you authorize us to update our records to reflect the new expiration date and to continue to use the account as before.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(m) If a third party sues <b>TWC </b>based on your use of our <b>Services </b>(for example, claiming theft or copyright violation based on something you posted on-line using our <b>HSD Service</b>), you will indemnify us (in other words, make us whole) for any losses, <b>including </b>reasonable attorneys’ fees, that we suffer.</p>

2.
Your Responsibilities Regarding Equipment
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) You will allow us to enter your premises to install, maintain or replace <b>Equipment </b>and to make sure our <b>Services </b>are operating and being delivered properly to you and your neighbors.
If you stop receiving <b>Services </b>from us, you may terminate these rights by giving us one year’s advance notice.
You confirm that you are authorized to grant the rights described in this paragraph.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) After we install or remove <b>Equipment </b>or wiring on your premises, you are responsible for any repairs or cosmetic corrections you wish to make.
We have an obligation to make such repairs only if we performed our work negligently and your property was damaged as a result.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) We can make changes to <b>Equipment </b>and <b>Software </b>through downloads from our network or otherwise.
If you have a third party device (for example, a “Tru2way” device) attached to our <b>Customer Use Equipment</b>, we or the device manufacturer may from time to time download software to the device, which may change its features and functionality.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) You may not move our <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> to any location other than the location where you initially received the <b>Services</b>.
This is true even if you have moved to a new location and continue to pay us for the <b>Services</b>.
 You may not remove or alter our logos or other identifying information (for example, serial numbers) on the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) You must return the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> to us in good condition when the <b>Services</b> are terminated and, if you fail to do so, we have your permission to retrieve the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> from your premises at your expense.
You are responsible for applicable fees until we receive the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b>.
 If we do not receive the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> within a reasonable amount of time after the <b>Services </b>are terminated, we are entitled to assume that you have lost the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(f) If the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> is lost, stolen or damaged, you must reimburse us (as “liquidated damages”) even if you are not at fault.
The liquidated damages amount for our <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> is available on request from your local <b>TWC </b>office.
You agree that this liquidated damages approach is reasonable in light of the difficulty of determining the value of the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> or the losses we could suffer if a third party improperly gained access to our <b>Services </b>using <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> we provided to you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(g) The <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> we provide to you always belongs to us.
This includes <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> that is lost, stolen or damaged and that you reimburse us for.
If you recover previously lost or stolen <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> for which you reimbursed us during the prior year, you will return the <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> to us and we will return the money you paid to us.</p>

Your Right to Use our Services and Property is Limited
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) The <b>Services </b>we provide and the way we deliver them will change from time to time, in part due to our efforts to improve them.
These changes may impact the <b>Services</b>
</p>
<p>you receive today, or may require that you change your own equipment or its configuration, or lease new or additional <b>Customer Use Equipment</b> from us, to continue to obtain the full benefit of those <b>Services</b>.
If you are under a promotional or other offering with a set price for a period of time, you are assured only that you will be charged the set price during the time specified.
You are not assured that the <b>Services </b>you receive (or that our equipment and system requirements) will remain the same.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) The <b>Services </b>are for your reasonable, personal non-commercial use only.
You may not provide the <b>Services </b>to any person who is not a member or guest in your household, or to persons outside your premises, whether for a fee or otherwise.
You will take reasonable precautions to prevent others from gaining unauthorized access to the <b>Services</b>.
For example, if you use a home wireless network with the <b>Services</b>, you will establish and use a secure password or similar means of limiting access to the members of your household.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) If you knowingly access <b>Services </b>that you have not paid for, or damage or alter our <b>Equipment </b>(or use third party equipment) in order to obtain <b>Services </b>that you have not paid for, you will have breached this <b>Agreement</b> and possibly subjected yourself to statutory damages, fines or imprisonment.
We can always enforce our rights with respect to theft of or tampering with our <b>Services</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) You are only allowed to use our <b>Software </b>and other intellectual property (for example, our name and logo) as needed to receive our <b>Services</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) We will conduct maintenance from time to time that may interrupt the Services.</p>

Special Information for Digital Home Phone Subscribers
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) Our service cable modem is electrically powered, and Digital Home Phone service, <b>including </b>home security services, may not operate in the event of an electrical power outage.
If a power outage occurs in your home and if your cable-modem is equipped with a battery, it may enable back-up service for a limited period of time or not at all, depending on the circumstances.
If your local <b>TWC </b>system loses power or experiences other service issues, the battery in your cable modem, if any, will not provide back-up service and Digital Home Phone will not be available.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) If you intend to use the Digital Home Phone Service with a home security or medical monitoring system, you are responsible for making sure it works properly and for the cost of doing so.
You should contact your home security or medical monitoring provider in order to test your system’s operation with the Digital Home Phone Service.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) The cable modem that we provide to you is linked to the address on your <b>Work Order</b>.
If you call 911, emergency personnel will respond to that address.
If you move the cable modem to another address, emergency personnel may not be able to locate you if you call 911.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) If we do not comply with your requests regarding directory listing information (for example, list the wrong number or list a number you requested be unlisted), you may be entitled to a credit under our policies or, if greater, an amount prescribed by applicable regulatory requirements.
Please contact your local <b>TWC </b>office for more information.
Other than these credits, we have no liability with respect to directory listings.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) Ensuring that your address is correctly listed with 911 databases normally takes between 24 and 120 hours from the time that you subscribe to Digital Home Phone service.
Enhanced 911 service (which includes your address information) will not be available until such databases are updated.</p>
<p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
5.
Special Information for HSD Subscribers
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) We may use <b>Network Management Tools</b> to make our <b>Services</b> operate efficiently.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) Each <b>HSD Service</b> level may have a <b>Maximum Throughput Rate</b>, a <b>Bandwidth Limit</b> or other characteristics.
For more information, please review our Acceptable Use Policy or contact your local <b>TWC</b> office.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) We can set or change the<b> Maximum Throughput Rate</b>, <b>Bandwidth Limit</b> or other characteristics of any <b>HSD Service</b> level.
If we do, we may put in place additional terms to address usage that is not consistent with the resulting <b>HSD Service</b> level.
For example, if we set or change the <b>Bandwidth Limit</b> that applies to your <b>HSD Service</b> level and you exceed the limit, we may suspend your <b>HSD Service</b>, reduce your <b>Maximum Throughput Rate</b> or charge you for your excess usage.
You may need to subscribe to a more expensive <b>HSD Service</b> level or pay for additional bandwidth to avoid suspension or slower <b>HSD Service</b>.
We will notify you of any new or changed <b>Bandwidth Limit</b> (or any material reduction in the previously published <b>Maximum Throughput Rate</b>) for your <b>HSD Service</b> level and any related terms.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) We may monitor your bandwidth usage patterns and your compliance with our <b>Customer Agreements</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) The <b>HSD Service</b> will attain <b>Maximum Throughput Rate</b> only in bursts and not on a guaranteed or consistent basis.
The <b>Throughput Rate</b> you experience at any time will be affected by a number of factors, <b>including </b>the nature of the Internet and its protocols, our facilities, the bandwidth we devote to carriage of protocol and network information, the condition and configuration of the equipment at your location, our use of <b>Network Management Tools</b>, data volume and congestion on our network and the Internet, the time of day you are using the <b>HSD Service</b>, the performance of the website servers you try to access, and the priority we give to our business subscribers’ data traffic.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(f) If you send or post materials through the <b>HSD Service</b>, you are responsible for the material and confirm that you have all necessary rights to do so.
You grant us, with no obligation to pay you, all rights we need to complete your transmission or posting.
If we determine that the transmission or posting violates our <b>Customer Agreements</b>, we may (but have no duty to) delete the materials, block access to them or cancel your account.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(g) The <b>HSD Service</b> requires the use of a cable modem.
We will provide you with a cable modem or you may obtain one separately.
If you use a modem that we have not approved for use on your <b>TWC</b> system, the <b>HSD Service</b> may not work properly.
For a list of <b>TWC</b> approved modems, see http://help.rr.com/modems.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(h) Your <b>OLP </b>may have one or more separate agreements, policies or other terms covering some of your rights and obligations with regard to the <b>HSD Service</b> (for example, dial-up or wireless access to your <b>OLP </b>email).
If your <b>HSD Service</b> is terminated, you should contact your <b>OLP</b> to ensure that these other services are properly continued or discontinued.</p>

Objectionable Material and Parental Controls
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) Our <b>Services </b>make available some material that may offend you or be inappropriate for members of your household. <b>TWC </b>provides parental controls and other tools that can filter or block access to certain video programming and Internet content.
The availability and effectiveness of these tools may vary depending on your equipment and software.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) Parental controls for Internet can be downloaded at http://www.rr.com/security.
Parental controls for video programming generally require that you lease a set-top box from us.
For more information, please contact your local <b>TWC </b>office.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) Even if you use the parental controls we provide, your household may be exposed to materials you find objectionable.</p>

<p>

If You Have Service Problems, You May Be Entitled to a Credit
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) We will attempt to correct service problems caused by our <b>Equipment</b> or <b>Software</b> but we are not required to install, service or replace other equipment or software.
Depending on the circumstances, we may charge you for service calls.
For more information, please contact your local <b>TWC</b> office.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) <b>TWC</b> has no liability for service interruptions except that, if you lose all Video, HSD or Digital Home Phone Service for more than 24 consecutive hours and the cause of the outage was within our reasonable control, we will provide you a credit for that period if you request one.
If you experience a service problem with a VOD transaction, we will issue you a credit for the amount of the VOD purchase if you request one.
All credit requests must be made within 30 days of your next bill following the outage or service issue.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) We have no obligation to compensate you for service problems that are beyond our reasonable control.
Examples of problems beyond our reasonable control <b>include</b> those caused by storms and other natural disasters, vandalism, terrorism, regulations or governmental acts, fires, civil disturbances, electrical power outages, computer viruses or strikes.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) Local law may impose other outage credit requirements with respect to some or all of the <b>Services</b>.
If this is the case in your area, we will follow the law.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) Our <b>Services</b> may not work with equipment, software or services that we did not provide to you.
For example, some "cable ready" or "digital cable ready" televisions and DVRs may not receive or support all of our <b>Video Services</b> even if we provide you with a CableCARD™ as recommended by the device manufacturer.
To get the full benefit of our Services, you may need to lease Customer Use Equipment from us.</p>

We May Change our Customer Agreements
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) We may change our <b>Customer Agreements</b> by amending the on-line version of the relevant document.
Unless you have entered into an Addendum that ensures a fixed price for a period of time (for instance, a Price Lock Guarantee Addendum), we may also change the prices for our services or the manner in which we charge for them.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) If you continue to use the <b>Services</b> following any change in our <b>Customer Agreements</b>, prices or other policies, you will have accepted the changes (in other words, made them legally binding).
If you do not agree to the changes, you will need to contact your local <b>TWC </b>office to cancel your <b>Services</b>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) Any changes to our <b>Customer Agreements</b> are intended to be prospective only.
In other words, the amended version of the relevant document only becomes binding on you as of the date that we make the change.</p>

We May Enforce our Customer Agreements
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) If we think you have violated our <b>Customer Agreements</b>, we have the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your<b> Services </b>without prior notification.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) We do not waive (in other words, give up) any rights under our C<b>ustomer Agreements</b> just because we have not previously enforced such rights.
To be legally binding on us, any waiver we grant must be in writing.
If we waive a violation of our <b>Customer Agreements</b>, it does not mean that we are waiving other rights, <b>including </b>in respect of earlier or later violations.</p>

THE <b>SERVICES </b>ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
THIS INCLUDES SO-CALLED “IMPLIED WARRANTIES” (SUCH AS THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).
IF THE LAW WHERE YOU LIVE SAYS WE CAN NOT EXCLUDE CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THEN THOSE WARRANTIES ARE NOT EXCLUDED.</p>

You are Consenting to Use Electronic Notices and Communications
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) <b>TWC</b> may provide notices to you using any method we determine appropriate, including by electronic means (for example, email or online posting).</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) We may ask you to provide consents or authorizations, including by electronic means (for instance, using your remote control to purchase a VOD movie, receive information regarding an advertiser’s products or “opt in” to a consumer study), and we are entitled to assume that any consent or authorization we receive through your <b>Services</b> or from your location has been authorized by you.</p>

You are Agreeing to Limit the Time You Have to Bring a Legal Action
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You waive (in other words, give up) the right to commence any proceeding against <b>TWC </b>if the relevant events occurred more than one year earlier.
This waiver is not enforceable, and the normal statute of limitations in your area will apply, if you notified TWC in writing of the events giving rise to the proceeding within one year of their occurrence.</p>

Unless you Opt Out, You are Agreeing to Resolve Certain Disputes Through Arbitration
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(a) Our goal is to resolve Disputes fairly and quickly.
However, if we cannot resolve a <b>Dispute </b>with you, then, except as described elsewhere in Section 15, each of us agrees to submit the <b>Dispute</b> to the American Arbitration Association for resolution under its Commercial Arbitration Rules or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution.
As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if its rules permit it.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(b) You may bring claims only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of any official or other person, or any class of people.
Only claims for money damages may be submitted to arbitration.
claims for injunctive orders or similar relief must be brought in a court.
You may not combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under this <b>Agreement </b>with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this<b> Agreement</b>.
The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(c) The arbitrator will issue an award decision in writing but will not provide an explanation for the award unless you or <b>TWC</b> requests one.
Any arbitration award over $75,000 may be appealed to a three-person panel appointed by the same arbitration institution that rendered the original award.
Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days and the appeal will be decided, based on that institution’s appeal rules, within 120 days of filing.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(d) Before you initiate an arbitration proceeding, you may request that we advance on your behalf (1) the arbitration filing fees (but only to the extent they exceed your local small claims court filing fees) and (2) the portion of the arbitrator’s costs for which you would normally be responsible.
If <b>TWC</b> wins the arbitration, you will reimburse us for these advances.
<b>TWC</b> will, of course, pay any fees or costs required under the law where you live.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(e) You may opt out of this agreement’s arbitration provision.
If you do so, neither you nor <b>TWC </b>can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify<b> TWC</b> in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use one of these addresses to opt out:</p>
<p>
<br>

<p>New York, NY 10023</p>

<p>or</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>http://www.timewarnercable.com/arbitrationoptout </p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>You must <b>include </b>your name, address and <b>TWC</b> account number and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this <b>Agreement’s </b>arbitration obligation.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>(f) If the prohibition against class action and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained in Section 15(b) is found to be unenforceable, then all of Section 15 will be null and void.
This arbitration clause will survive the termination of your <b>Services</b>.</p>
