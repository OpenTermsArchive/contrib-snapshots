reddit privacy policy <em>effective May 15, 2013</em>
<blockquote>
<p>your privacy is a core reddit value.<br>
we strive to create a policy worthy of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1 We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly
how and why we use your information.
This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes
what information we collect and what it's used for.
It applies to all interactions with reddit.com,
including content posted through iReddit, and interactions with our site through the button
and widget.
However, other services we own – such as redditgifts – and loosely affiliated but
independent services (for instance, radio reddit) have their own terms, and you should review
them on each service's respective website.</p>
<p>2 Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Your use of and/or registration with reddit will
constitute your agreement to our policy.
If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set
forth below, please do not use our services.
Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User
Agreement, and by using the site you agree to both.</p>
About this Policy
<p>3 reddit is an open platform that allows you to communicate about anything you want on any
topic you want.
We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use
to participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work.
Our
goal in developing our privacy practices is to allow your participation to remain as anonymous as
you choose and we don’t sell or profit from the information you share with us.</p>
<p>4 We do take efforts to make sure the platform keeps working.
This includes using your
information, where necessary, to stop spam and gaming and other activities that violate the
user agreement.
We also share your information when we are legally required to do so.
Please read this privacy policy carefully.
It describes
what information we collect, how it is used, and when it is shared so you can make smart
decisions about how you use reddit! We think it strikes a good balance and respects you – our
users – who make this whole thing possible.
Let us know what you think.</p>
What Information We Collect
Registration Information
<p>5 When you create an account, you are required to provide a username
and password, and may opt to provide an email address.
We also log, and retain indefinitely, the
IP address from which the account is initially created.</p>
Post, Comment and Messaging Data
<p>6 <em>The posts and comments you make on reddit are not
private, even if made to a subreddit not readily accessible to the public.
This means that, by
default, they are not deleted from our servers – ever – and will still be accessible after your
account is deleted.
However, we only save the most recent version of comments and posts, so
your previous edits, once overwritten, are no longer available.</em>
</p>
<p>7 Your messages are generally only viewable by the parties involved, but they may be accessed
internally as needed for community support.
Moreover, we keep a complete log of all messages
sent on our service, even when both parties later delete their accounts.</p>
<p>8 <em>reddit stores the IP addresses associated with specific posts, comments, and private messages for
90 days after they are made or sent.</em>
</p>
reddit gold
<p>9 If you choose to upgrade to reddit gold, this status will be stored on your profile,
along with the transaction number associated with the payment.
However, reddit does not handle
or have access to any of your payment information.
For questions about how this information is
stored and used, please read our third party partners’ privacy policies.</p>
Log Data
<p>10 Log data is certain information that is automatically collected by our systems when
you visit reddit, including the type of software used to access the site (browser, operating
system), the address of the external or internal page that referred you, and your IP address.
This
information is recorded even if you are logged out of your account.
It will be deleted from our
servers after 90 days.</p>
Other Information Related to Your Account
<p>11 As you interact with reddit as an accountholder, we
save certain information about these interactions and your preferences: subscriptions, preferred
language, all languages you see content in, accumulated karma, voting data, and date of last
login.
You may also opt to add "flair" to decorate your profile, and this will be stored as well.</p>
How We Use or Disclose Collected Information
Our Use of Your Information Is Limited to Improving Your Experience
<p>12 It takes a lot of work to keep our site running and prevent abuse, and we sometimes use your data in order to
facilitate this.
Your information is used internally only where necessary to provide our services.
For instance, we keep IP addresses for 90 days in order to investigate issues with our site, track
and block suspected spammers, and otherwise maintain the integrity of the community.</p>
Your Private Information Is Never for Sale
<p>13 This means that we will only share your personal
data with your consent, and after letting you know what information will be shared and with
whom, unless it is otherwise permitted in this policy.
While advertisers may target their ads
to the topic of a given subreddit, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information
collected about our users to any third party.</p>
<p>14 Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be
made available to third parties.</p>
Reddit Will Not Disclose Your Information Unless Required by Law
<p>15 We may disclose – or
preserve for future disclosure – your information if we believe, after due consideration, that
doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process.
If we are
going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance via
reddit's private messaging system unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2705(b)).</p>
Your Information May Be Disclosed By Us In An Emergency or to Keep our Services Running
<p>16 Other extraordinary circumstances may require disclosure: we may also disclose your
information when we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a
person.
to address fraud, security, or spam.
or to protect our rights or property.</p>
Cookie Policy
<p>17 Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order to help
them remember certain information about you.
At reddit, we set only a few cookies for tracking
user preferences, authentication, and collecting anonymous analytics data.
Additionally, our
advertising partners set cookies.
Each of these uses is described in greater detail below.</p>
Preference Cookies
<p>18 If you are logged out, reddit will place a simple cookie to remember
if you indicate you would like to view over 18 content, or if you set a language
preference.
Additionally, if you vote an advertisement up or down, our third-party
advertising partner, Adzerk, will set a cookie to remember your ad preferences.</p>
Authentication Cookies
<p>19 When you log into your account, reddit will place a cookie
for the sole purpose of creating this session.
It contains your user id and hashed
authentication information.</p>
Analytics Cookies
<p>20 We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how
users interact with our website.
It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as
how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors
to the site.
By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better.
To learn more
about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.</p>
Advertising Cookies
<p>21 <em>We partner with Adzerk to show our users third party ads.</em>
</p>
<p>22 Some
cookies may be placed during the provision of this service pursuant to Adzerk's privacy policy.</p>
Disabling cookies
<p>23 Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones.
However, if you do this, portions of the reddit website may not function as intended.</p>
Account Deletion
<p>24 <em>You may choose to delete your reddit account at any time.
The usernames associated with
deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use, and your public profile is no longer visible
to users of the site.
However, the posts and content you made during your tenure as a reddit user
will not be automatically deleted as part of the account removal process, though your username
will be publicly disassociated with all posts.</em>
</p>
Third Party Sites
<p>25 Certain third party sites may offer users the option to log in using their reddit id (for example,
redditgifts).
This option is only an authentication tool and does not transmit any new personal
information to reddit, or give reddit access to details of subsequent actions taken on these sites.</p>
Data Security
<p>26 reddit will make every effort to secure any private information submitted to us by our users.
However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the
absolute security of this data.
You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking
reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password).</p>
International Visitors
<p>27 reddit is a San Francisco, California-based company whose servers are housed in the United States.
All personal information we collect from our international users is transferred to the United States and
processed according to US law.</p>
<p>28 reddit complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor
Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
reddit has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward
transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

program, and to view reddit's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
Children Under 13
<p>29 Although we welcome users from all walks of life, our site is not aimed at children, and the
United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of
1998.
Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us.
If you believe someone
12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us.</p>
Changes to This Policy
<p>30 We reserve the right to change this policy to meet the changing needs of reddit, or for any other
reason.
If we make changes, we will notify our users.
Where the changes substantially alters
your rights, notice will appear prominently on your front page.
More minor changes may only be highlighted by the privacy policy link in the footer
of our website.</p>
