You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer.
We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to record registration and personalization information.
For example, if you register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer.
Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with our affiliates and other companies.
</p>
<p>
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well.
We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
</p>
<p>
We may also use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website.Â  These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.
In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data.
The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
