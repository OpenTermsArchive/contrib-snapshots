<br>
<p>We may use and disclose your personal information to facilitate social sharing functionality that you initiate.
If you choose to connect your social media account with your Services account or otherwise engage in social sharing on the Services, your personal information may be shared with your friends, contacts or others associated with your social media account, with other Services users, and with your social media account provider.

<br>
<p>We may combine information that does not personally identify you with personal information.
If we do, we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>
<br>Prescription Drug Plan Information <p>If you are a member of a prescription drug plan (“Plan”) managed by CVS/caremark and have filled prescriptions with CVS in the past, you may use cvs.com to access your Plan information instead of having to log in separately through www.caremark.com.
Plan information is maintained separately by CVS/caremark on behalf of Plans for their Plan members.</p>
<br>Links <p>The Services may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party websites, services, or other resources not operated by us or on our behalf (“Third Party Services”).
These links are provided as a convenience only and do not constitute an affiliation with, endorsement or sponsorship of the Third Party Services.
In particular, you acknowledge that photo processing and order pick-up or delivery services provided in connection with the Services are provided by, respectively, Snapfish and Curbside, or other third parties, and not by CVS.
Any information you provide to such third parties is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy or security of the information you provide to them or their handling of your information.
We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any third party to whom you provide personal information online.</p>
<br>Security <p>We seek to use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect personal information within our organization.
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

<br>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Services access information and password and for restricting access to your device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.</p>
<br>Cookies and Other Technologies <p>Like many other websites and online services, we collect information about Services traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies, Web server logs, and other, similar technologies.
We use this information for various purposes, such as to ensure that the Services function properly, to facilitate navigation, to personalize your experience, to understand use of the Services, to diagnose problems, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and to otherwise administer the Services.</p>
<br>
<p>Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer's hard drive.
These small text files help us personalize content on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons.
Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies.
Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.</p>
<br>
<p>Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and retain certain information about a website user, such as the type of Web browser used by our customer.
Reviewing our Web server logs and our customers' use of our site helps us to, among other purposes, statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.</p>
<br>
<p>Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider.
An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.
We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.</p>
<br>
<p>We may use Adobe Flash Local Stored Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.
If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.
You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.</p>
<br>Tracking/Third-Party Advertisers <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to display advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other online services.
To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags).
If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.</p>
<br>
<p>We may use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags and other, similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and your use of other websites or online services.</p>
<br>Physical Location <p>We and our service providers may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, beacons, Bluetooth, and near field communication protocols, when you are in or near a CVS store.
We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, including for marketing purposes.
We may also use such information to understand traffic patterns in, near, and across our store locations.
We may share aggregated statistics derived from the location and other information we collect with advertisers and other third parties.
You may be permitted to allow or deny such collection of your device’s location, such as through the settings on your mobile device and/or, to avoid the collection of location by beacons, by disabling Bluetooth.
If you choose to deny such collection, we and our service providers may not be able to provide you with certain personalized services and content.</p>
<br>Fraudulent Sites, Spam &amp.
Phishing <p>Please be aware that there may be fraudulent websites that illegally use CVS logos, and other aspects of the CVS brand.
CVS is in no way associated with any fraudulent websites.
These sites may circulate their presence on the internet via spam email, or through fraudulent phishing practices.</p>
<br>
<p>These sites have not been authorized by CVS to use our name and we work aggressively to identify their source and have them shut down.
If you are in receipt of this type of spam email, to help protect your privacy you should avoid replying to it or forwarding it to other people.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to our official websites, CVS works with a number of third parties that host websites and micro-sites that provide information and services to our customers.
If you are concerned that a website or an email may be fraudulent, please contact us by phone at 888-607-4287 with your concerns.</p>
<br>Your Choices and Access <p>You can take yourself off our email list for promotional offers at any time by updating your Email Communications preference in your Account Profile in the My Account section or by following the instructions contained in such emails.
