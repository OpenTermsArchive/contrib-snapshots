<br>Links <p>CVS.com contains links to other websites not operated by CVS Caremark.
These links are provided as a convenience and do not constitute an affiliation with, endorsement or sponsorship of the third parties that operate those websites.
CVS Caremark is not responsible for the availability or reliability of the content of these third party websites.
Any information you provide to those third parties is not subject to the terms of this privacy policy, and CVS Caremark is not responsible for the treatment of the information you provide to those third parties.
We recommend that you review the privacy policy of that third party, and of any third party to whom you provide personally identifiable information online.</p>
<br>How We Keep Your Information Secure <p>We use state-of-the-art security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
Specifically, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for the areas of our site where we ask you to provide personally identifiable information.
SSL technology provides for the safe transmission of personal information you give us because the information is encrypted.
Encryption involves systematically scrambling numbers and letters so that if someone managed to intercept a packet of information, they would not be able to make sense of it.
Although encryption slows the process of sending information across the Internet, it does provide better protection for your information.</p>
<br>
<p>You can tell you have entered a secured area when you look at the Universal Resource Locator (URL) in your browser's address bar and see that it has "https://" before the rest of the Web address.
The "s" means that the page is hosted from a secured server.
We use secured servers for our Registration/Membership and Sign In pages, Your Account pages, order processing pages, and special promotions.
Unsecured pages have URLs that begin with "http://" (without the "s").
Most of our shopping aisles and health information areas are hosted from servers that do not use SSL.
Since we do not collect personal information in these areas, using regular servers ensures a faster browsing experience.</p>
<br>
<p>You may on occasion encounter a standard warning that many browsers display when a visitor moves from a "secured" page to an "unsecured" page.
When you encounter such a warning on our Web site, it usually means that you are moving from an "https://" to an "http://" page.
If you see other browser warnings or error messages concerning the security of our site, please Contact Us.
Include the specific wording you saw and where at CVS.com you encountered the message.
Providing us with these details helps us to know if you have encountered a technical difficulty or a standard warning like the one described above.</p>
<br>
<p>If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password and for restricting access to your computer and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.</p>
<br>
<p>We will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security.</p>
<br>Cookies <p>Like many other websites, we also collect information about site traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies and Web server logs.
Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer's hard drive.
These small text files help us personalize content on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons.
Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies.
Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.</p>
<br>
<p>Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and retain certain information about a website user, such as the type of Web browser used by our customer.
This information is not linked to personally identifiable information about a particular individual or customer account, but it is collected from a particular computer as the user moves through a website.</p>
<br>
<p>Reviewing our Web server logs and our customers' use of our site helps us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.
Only authorized CVS.com personnel have access to the Web server logs, cookie utilization data, and purchase history information collected by us.
These employees are held to strict confidentiality and security policies and procedures.</p>
<br>Fraudulent Sites, Spam &amp.
Phishing <p>Please be aware that there may be fraudulent websites that illegally use CVS logos, and other aspects of the CVS brand.
CVS is in no way associated with any fraudulent websites.
These sites may circulate their presence on the internet via spam email, or through fraudulent phishing practices.</p>

<p>These sites have not been authorized by CVS to use our name and we work aggressively to identify their source and have them shut down.
If you are in receipt of this type of spam email, to help protect your privacy you should avoid replying to it or forwarding it to other people.</p>

It can enter your computer as a software virus or as a result of installing a new program.
It is used to gather information about your personal internet usage, monitor keyboard strokes or capture personal information for use by other parties.
