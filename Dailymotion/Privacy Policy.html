Dailymotion respects your privacy and has developed this privacy policy (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) to present our commitment to protecting your privacy and to explain how we collect, use, and share Personal Data from or about you in connection with your use of the Dailymotion Service (the “<b>Data</b>”).
</p><p>
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Dailymotion Service or transacting business with us.
</p><p>
If you reside in a country that is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area">European Economic Area</a> (including in the United Kingdom), or Switzerland (collectively referred to as “EEA”), any reference to "<b>Dailymotion</b>", "<b>we</b>", "<b>us</b>", or “<b>our</b>” in this Privacy Policy will always refer to “Dailymotion SA” whose details are provided <a href="/legal/infos">here</a>.
</p><p>
If you reside in a country that is not part of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, any reference to “<b>Dailymotion</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>” in this Privacy Policy will always refer to “<b>Dailymotion Inc.</b>” whose details are provided <a href="/legal/infos">here</a>.
</p><b>DEFINITIONS</b><p>
The terms “<b>Dailymotion Service</b>” or “<b>Service</b>” refer to the following: the Dailymotion principal website accessible at <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com">www.dailymotion.com</a> and at any of its local versions (the “<b>Dailymotion Site</b>”), the Dailymotion secondary websites (“<b>Secondary Sites</b>”), the Dailymotion video player when it is embedded onto any website (the "Video Player"), the Dailymotion apps and web-apps (the “<b>Dailymotion Applications</b>”) as accessible via any current or future device capable of distributing the Dailymotion Site and/or the Video Player, together with any Dailymotion products, content, channels, software, data feeds, services and functionality.
</p><p>
In connection with its main activity as a content hosting platform, Dailymotion operates Secondary Sites addressed to professionals in the advertising industry, such as software developers wanting to contribute to or use the Dailymotion APIs, content right holders interested in the Dailymotion’s Partner Program, advertisers, media agencies and various actors of the marketing sector who wish to learn more about our offering. All of the Secondary Sites can be accessed from the Dailymotion Site but, due to the particularity of their audience, may be subject to distinct terms of use. The use of their visitors’ Data is limited by the particular purpose of these sites and is further explained in the dedicated Section 9 of the present Privacy Policy.
</p><p>The term “<b>Commercial Partner</b>” refers to entities Dailymotion may cooperate with while carrying out its Services. In particular, Commercial Partners may include content editors, advertisers, media agencies and other actors of the on-line marketing sector. Dailymotion belongs to the <a href="https://www.vivendi.com/en/vivendi-en/vivendi-in-brief-2/"><b>Vivendi group</b></a> of companies. Some of the Commercial Partners may also be a part of the <a href="https://www.vivendi.com/en/vivendi-en/vivendi-in-brief-2/"><b>Vivendi group</b></a> and thus will also be Dailymotion’s affiliates.</p><p>The term “<b>Content</b>” refers to videos available on the Service.</p><p>The terms “<b>Personal Data,</b>” “<b>Data Controller,</b>” “<b>Joint Controller,</b>” “<b>Data Processor</b>” and “<b>Processing</b>” used in the present Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as defined in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=FR#d1e1874-1-1">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (“<b>GDPR</b>”), or unless, otherwise stated herein, under applicable local data protection laws. Personal Data processed by Dailymotion is referred to as “<b>Data</b>”.</p><p>We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Dailymotion Service or transacting business with us.</p><ol class="decimal bold"><li><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2><ul class="sub"><li>
                1.1. <u>Dailymotion’s Role in Processing of Personal Data</u><p>Certain Data from or about you may be collected or otherwise processed when you use the Dailymotion Service, regardless of whether you do so as a Viewer, Visitor, User, or member of the “<b>Partner Program</b>” (as defined in the Dailymotion <a href="/legal/terms?localization=en">Terms of Use</a>).</p><p>If you reside in a country that is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area">European Economic Area</a>, the GDPR is applicable to the collection of your Personal Data. If you reside outside of the EEA, local laws are applicable to such collection. </p><p>Note that the laws applicable to further processing of your Personal Data depend on your country of residency and that of an entity that uses your Personal Data.</p><p>When Dailymotion (or its Data Processors) process your Data, we do so for the purposes that we have defined and explained to you in the present Privacy Policy and, if applicable laws require so, subject to existence of a valid legal basis justifying such Processing (e.g. your consent, legitimate interest, contract execution, legal obligation). In such cases, Dailymotion acts in its role of a Data Controller. We may hire some service providers to help us implement certain aspects of your Data Processing. In doing so, these service providers act on our behalf following our instructions and thus are considered our Data Processors.</p><p>In some cases, Dailymotion and its Commercial Partners may process your Personal Data together for joint purposes. Under these circumstances, Dailymotion and these Commercial Partners act in their role of Joint Controllers.</p><p>Your Personal Data may also be processed by our Commercial Partners (or by their respective Data Processors) for purposes that each of them defines independently. It is the Commercial Partners who are Data Controllers for such Processing of your Personal Data; the role of Dailymotion is limited to the collection of consent on Commercial Partners’ behalf (if applicable), transmission of collected consent to such Commercial Partners and providing you with access to their respective privacy policies and consent management mechanisms.</p><p>Dailymotion may also participate in implementation of some Personal Data Processing operations carried out by our Commercial Partners. In such cases, Dailymotion acts in its role of a Data Processor while our Commercial Partners remain Data Controllers.</p></li><li>
                1.2. <u>Legal Basis for Processing of Personal Data</u><p>The GDPR provides several situations upon which Dailymotion can rely for Processing of Personal Data, namely consent, contractual necessity, compliance with a legal obligation, vital interests of data subjects, public interest or legitimate interest. Similarly, applicable laws may provide other or similar legal bases, as explained further below in the country specific sections.</p><p>When Processing of your Personal Data requires your consent, we ask you to communicate your consent either via a positive action (e.g. by activating “Accept” button on our Site, Secondary Site or Video Player) or via an explicit decision for each of the purposes your consent is being collected for, in accordance with applicable laws.</p><p>Dailymotion participates in the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/">“Transparency &amp; Consent Framework”</a> (“<b>TCF</b>”), developed by the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/about-us/">Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)</a> and complies with its Specifications and Policies. We operate a TCF-compliant Consent Management Platform (IAB / TCF identification number 105) for the consent collection and management for Dailymotion’s and our Commercial Partners’ data processing activities in connection with Dailymotion Service and, in general, for the communication of user consent information to our Commercial Partners. Dailymotion is also registered with the IAB as a Vendor (IAB / TCF identification number 573).</p><p>You can always choose not to consent to Processing of some of your Data, withdraw your consent, or oppose such Processing (unless the applicable laws authorize or require us not to take into account such decision) as further explained herein. However, this may limit your ability to take full advantage of the many features we offer, including features that are needed for our Service to operate as it is intended to and, consequently, seriously deteriorate your user experience. If you do not agree to the collection and use of Data needed for our Service to operate at its optimal capacities, we strongly advise you not to use Dailymotion Service as we will not be capable of providing you with the high quality service you may expect from us.<u></u></p></li><li>
                1.3. <u>Transfer of Data</u><p>The Data collected by us through our Service may be sent to and stored on servers located in the United States, France, and other countries around the world.</p><p>We ensure that legally required, appropriate contractual or other mechanisms are present prior to transfers of Data outside of the EEA.</p></li></ul></li><li><h2>DATA WE COLLECT</h2><p>We may collect Personal Data that can identify you directly, such as your name and email address, and other information that does not identify you directly. This Section explains what Personal Data we collect and how we collect such information.</p><ul class="sub"><li>
                2.1. <u>Categories of Data We Collect</u><ul class="sub"><li>
                        2.1.1 <b>Data You Provide to Us</b><p>We collect Personal Data you provide to us when you interact with the Dailymotion Service, including when you sign up for an account, upload Content, create a playlist or share a playlist with others. For instance, when you register to use the Dailymotion Service, we may collect your name, email address, birth date, gender, and other similar information. If you are a member of the Dailymotion Partner Program, Dailymotion may also collect your payment information, such as your address, bank account details and authentication information, as well as billing, shipping and contact details. Note that we do not collect your credit card details. In addition, Dailymotion may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences on the Dailymotion Service, directly contact Dailymotion through the <a href="https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?">Dailymotion Help Center</a> or by other means, or agree to participate in promotions that Dailymotion may offer from time to time. Dailymotion also allows multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to us if you create such profiles.</p></li><li>
                        2.1.2 <b>Usage and Log Data</b><p>We collect information when you use the Dailymotion Service or view Dailymotion ads outside of the Dailymotion Service. We may also collect information from or about the computers, phones, tablets, or other devices where you install Dailymotion Applications or otherwise access the Dailymotion Service, depending on the permissions you have granted. Examples of this information may include your IP address, device ID number, settings of the browser and software you use (such as type and version of an operating system or its language settings), activity on the Dailymotion Service including information about the videos you watch on the Service (e.g. video titles and categories), about the ads you are being shown and your interaction with them, the frequency and duration of your activities, page views, referral URLs, network state, and carrier information.</p></li><li>
                        2.1.3 <b>Account and Profile Data from Third-Party Services</b><p>If you choose to log-in, access or otherwise connect to the Dailymotion Service or contact Dailymotion through a third-party service (e.g. Facebook), such method being completely optional and subject to your exclusive decision, we may, in order to execute your choice of a log-in or contact method, collect your user ID and user name associated with that third-party service as well as any other information you make public using that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the third-party service to share with us (such as, for example, your user ID, billing information, public profile information, email address, birthday, and profile data).</p></li><li>
                        2.1.4 <b>Third-Party Data</b><p>We may, if you authorized such third parties to share such information with us or if we believe that such sharing is in conformity with the applicable laws, receive from them or share with them information about you originating from other sources, such as data aggregators, public databases, and our Commercial Partners, be it <a href="https://www.vivendi.com/vivendi/vivendi-en-bref-2/">affiliated</a> or unaffiliated entities. Shared data (whether identified, pseudonymized or anonymous and whether collected online or offline) may include information about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your online activities (such as websites you have visited and/or advertisements you have viewed).</p><p>We may combine the shared information with the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in Section 3 of the Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.</p></li></ul></li><li>
                2.2. <u>How the Data Is Collected</u><p>Like many online services, we use, directly or via our subcontractors, various technologies to collect usage data and store your user settings. The Data thus collected helps us propose, protect and improve the Dailymotion Service and to personalize your user experience by adapting the Content and advertising to your taste. </p><p>Despite a variety of the actual measures deployed, the various technologies used to collect data are commonly referred to as “<b>cookies</b>” and their use is regulated by “cookie laws.” Whenever the applicable laws subject the use of cookies to user consent, Dailymotion asks for your consent prior to their use.</p><p>A “cookie” is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk.

Note that it does not mean that when you watch a video on our Service all of these Commercial Partners process your Personal Data. Only the Commercial Partners (or their technical service providers) involved in posting the ads shown to you or publishing Content that you watch on Dailymotion Service process your data.

                4.1. <u>Social Networking and Single Sign-On Services</u><p>When you choose to share information with social networking services or single sign-on services about your activities on the Dailymotion Service, such as videos you watched or “<b>liked</b>” on Dailymotion Service, such information about you and your activities is shared with that social network or single sign-on service.</p><p><b><i>Sharing with Facebook or Google</i></b>. If you connect to Dailymotion through your Facebook or Google accounts you may choose to share information about your activities on the Dailymotion Service with Facebook or Google and their users, by, for example, publishing on Facebook or Google information about the videos you watch on Dailymotion. Furthermore, if you visit Dailymotion while logged-in to Facebook or Google, then those entities may record your browser details and combine technical information from your web browser with other information that each of them already knows about you. Your decision to share information about your activities on the Dailymotion Service within your Facebook or Google profile may result in Dailymotion sending relevant information about you to Facebook or Google. Facebook or Google may then make that information visible to their respective users in accordance with applicable law, their own data and privacy policies, and your Facebook or Google privacy settings. We recommend you familiarize yourself with Facebook’s and Google’s respective data and privacy policies and available account privacy controls. We remind you that Dailymotion is independent from these third-party companies and that any privacy settings you might have chosen on the Dailymotion Service are not applicable on Facebook, Google or any other social network account.</p></li><li>
                4.2. <u>Commercial Partners</u><p>We work with a number of Commercial Partners who help us offer and improve the Dailymotion Service. Such Commercial Partners include, for example, our Content programmers, distributors, and other actors of the digital industry. We may disclose information collected from or about you to such Commercial Partners (or their authorized service providers) when we are legally authorized to do so, but such disclosure is always accompanied by appropriate technical, organizational or contractual measures aimed at ensuring the integrity and security of your information (e.g., aggregation, anonymization, etc.).</p><p>In particular, we may share information, generally in the aggregated, encrypted or anonymized form, about you with advertisers and advertising-related service providers. Some Data needs to be shared for technical reasons (e.g., to deliver advertising videos on your screen). Some Data is shared in order to make ads relevant and interesting to you or measure and improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. This information includes Data on your digital identifiers, devices used or online activities in relation to your use of the Dailymotion Service, such as the websites you have visited and advertisements you have viewed. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed its ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as a  female between 25 and 30 years of age, living in New York) to these advertisers to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by strict confidentiality obligations. Note that we do not share directly identifiable information about you (such as your email address) with advertisers and advertising-related service providers.</p></li><li>
                4.3. <u>Service Providers</u><p>Like most companies, we contract third parties to provide specialized services for us. We may share some of your Data with our service providers who provide us with specialized technical solutions, who are billing facilitators (e.g. PayPal or Payoneer), or who help us analyze and process data (e.g. provide analytic software helping us to improve ads relevancy), mange user accounts, host our websites and content, provide customer support, marketing tools (emails, on-line communication and letters) or otherwise assist us with provisions of the Dailymotion Service.</p><p>Our Service Providers commit to confidentiality obligations in conformity with the present Privacy Policy and contracts we sign with them.</p></li><li>
                4.4. <u>Audience Measurement Providers</u><p>Our Commercial Partners, such as content providers and advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their videos across many platforms, including the Dailymotion Service. Accordingly, Dailymotion may use and permit the use on its Service of independent, industry-standard, third-party measurement software (e.g. Nielsen or comScore) that enables us or our Business Partners to include your video views in our or their measurement statistics. We may also share our own usage statistics, in anonymized or aggregated form, with these Business Partners.</p><p>To learn more about your choices with respect to audience measurement software, please see the information we have provided in Section 9 ("Your Rights & Opting-Out").</p></li><li>
                4.5. <u>Public Authorities and Legal Counsel</u><p>In some instances, we may be required to disclose information from or about you to public authorities or legal counsel without providing you with notice or giving you the opportunity to consent. We may disclose your information in good-faith to protect the legal rights of Dailymotion, our affiliates or Commercial Partners, and each of our respective equity holders, directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners; to protect the safety and security of our users of the or of third parties; to enforce our <a href="/legal">Terms of Use</a>; to protect against fraud; for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond to the law, a legal process, or a request for cooperation by a government entity. However, it is Dailymotion’s policy, whenever reasonably possible and legally permissible, to promptly notify you upon receipt of a subpoena or court order requesting your Data and to not produce your Data until after receipt of such subpoena or court order, so that you will have adequate opportunity to initiate appropriate legal proceedings.</p><p>Furthermore, if you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by Dailymotion or another user of the Dailymotion Service, we may provide the Data that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint.</p></li><li>
                4.6. <u>Third Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions</u><p>If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a change-of-control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including as part of the due diligence process. Please note that in such a case your Data would be shared only as an integral part of the Dailymotion Service and not sold or transferred separately from the Service to third parties.</p></li><li>
                4.7. <u>Parties You Consented or When You Otherwise Choose to Share Your Data</u><p>In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share any information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information.

Our goal is to make you feel confident and safe when using the Dailymotion Service.</p><p>We use a variety of physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, and modification. For example, we take steps to limit access to sensitive information from or about you to only those Dailymotion employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to access such information. We also use measures like encryption and hashing to help protect sensitive information when in transmission, and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Data. We also use techniques such as data aggregation to render it more difficult to link and trace information to you.</p><p>Despite these efforts, there is always a possibility that a breach in data transmission or storage may occur. We want you to feel confident in our security when using the Dailymotion Service, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Data at all times. We advise you to exercise caution and, in particular, to use a unique password for your Dailymotion account, i.e. a password that you do not use for any other service you have an account with (which could prevent, in the event your Dailymotion password confidentiality is breached, unauthorized access to these other accounts), to change your password if you suspect its fraudulent use and contact us if you notice any suspicious activities on your Dailymotion account.</p></li><li>
                5.2. <u>Account Access</u><p>If you have an online account with us, your Personal Data can be reviewed online from within your account settings.

We advise you to choose a unique and complex password, not to disclose it to third parties, and change it if you have any doubts as to its confidentiality. Do not hesitate to contact us if you observe any suspicious activity on your account.</p><p>Please note that if you allow others to use your account (including by authorizing others to set up profiles within your account), they may be able to view information about your account (e.g. your email address) or any of the profiles created within your account (e.g. videos you have viewed).

                8.6. <u>Additional Choices for California Residents</u><ul class="sub"><li id="ccpa" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px;">
                        8.6.1. <b>Personal Data Processing Information under the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”)</b><ul class="sub"><li>
                                8.6.1.a. <b>General</b><p>If you are a California resident, in addition to any other information you may find in this Privacy Policy, this section is intended to provide you with specific information required under the California Consumer Protection Act (“<b>CCPA</b>”). In particular, this section describes Dailymotion’s practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of consumers’ Personal Information (hereafter referred to as “<b>PI</b>”) and includes an explanation of your rights regarding your own PI.</p><p>Note that rights and obligations provided under the CCPA take effect on 1st January 2020. If you decide to exercise any of such rights your request will be considered as of that date.</p><p>The terms “<b>Personal Information,</b>” “<b>Business,</b>” “<b>Third Party</b>” and “<b>Service Provider</b>” used in this section have the same meanings as defined in the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375">CCPA</a>.</p><p>If you have an account with Dailymotion, we identify you by the email address you use to log-in. However, if you do not have an account, in most cases, we rely on a unique online identifier to identify and recognize you.</p><p>When you access our Service, a Dailymotion cookie (i.e. a small text file) is dropped on your device’s browser. This cookie creates a unique online ID specific to the Dailymotion Service and allows us to recognize you when you visit us again (“<b>Service ID</b>”). If you use different devices or different Internet browsers to access our Service (and unless you do so as a logged-in user, in which case we might be able to recognize you regardless of the device or browser used), you are assigned a different Service ID for each of your  device/ browser combinations. In other words, if you first accessed the Dailymotion Service using Internet Explorer on your laptop, but then visited it on your phone using Chrome you will appear to us as two distinct users. Unless you access the Dailymotion Service as a logged-in user, any information that we might have about you is attached to that Service ID.</p><p>Due to legal rules applicable to our activities, the lifespan of our cookies is limited to 13 months. Once the 13-month period comes to an end, the Dailymotion cookie storing your Service ID expires. If you continue to use our Service, a new Dailymotion cookie will be dropped on your browser and a new Service ID will be assigned to you.</p><p>As already mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we do not cross-reference Service IDs that are assigned to you on our Service. Unless you are a logged-in user (in which case we may recognize you regardless of the number of Service IDs created for you, and we process your requests in relation to all Personal Data linked to your account), each new Service ID represents to us a new user.  For that reason, if you decide to exercise any of your CCPA rights, your decision will only be applied to the Service ID we recognize you under. In particular, if you use the Dailymotion Service on several devices or Internet browsers, your decision to Opt-Out of the sale of your PI needs to be expressed on each such device or browser.</p>
                                8.6.1.b. <b>Collected Personal Information: Categories, Sources and the Business or Commercial Purposes It is Used for.</b><p>We may obtain your PI either from you (directly or indirectly) or from our Service Providers or our affiliates. We receive your PI directly from you when you create an account or otherwise communicate with us or interact with our Service. We collect or generate information about you when you use our Service. Your PI may be shared with and by our affiliates if you use their services.</p><p>Note that in order to enable the delivery of ads, certain PI may be disclosed to us by advertising partners wishing to advertise on our Service or by Service Providers we work with in the operation of the Service.</p><p>The following categories of PI may be collected by us from or about you and used for the below-listed purposes:</p></p><table><tr><th>Category of PI</th><th>Example of PI</th><th>Purpose the PI is Collected for</th><th>Source the PI is Collected from</th><th>Categories of Third Parties with Whom PI May Be Shared</th></tr><tr><td>Identifiers</td><td>A real name, alias, postal address, Service ID, third party online identifier, IP address, email address, account name, a copy of official ID, or other similar identifiers</td><td>To comply with a legal obligation.

When we share your PI, we only do so to the extent needed to achieve our business purposes or to comply with the applicable laws or regulations.</p></li><li>
                                8.6.1.c. <b>Categories of Collected Personal Information that Might Be Disclosed or Sold to Third Parties</b><p>The CCPA defines the “<b>sale</b>” of PI as any communication of a consumer’s PI by a Business to another Business or a Third Party for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p><p>Dailymotion does not engage in data brokerage nor knowingly sells PI of minors under 16 years of age. As part of our regular business activities (i.e. operating an online service offering access to videos and displaying ads), your PI may be disclosed to companies we cooperate with. These companies may use such information to help us conduct our business activities (in doing so, they are our Service Providers), as well as for their own business purposes. If they do use your PI for their own business activities, our disclosure of your PI amounts to its sale.</p><p>In addition, our advertising partners collect PI, such as digital identifiers (e.g. online identifiers, IP address), activity history (how you interact with their ads) and electronic information, when you use our Service and are shown their ads. That information is used to deliver, analyze and tailor ads you see on our Service or elsewhere. To tailor ads that may be more relevant to you, we or our commercial partners may share it with Third Parties.</p><p>If you do not want us to sell your PI, you may decide to Opt-Out as further explained below in Section 8.6.1.e.</p><p>The following categories of PI may be disclosed or sold by us:</p><table><tr><th>Category of PI</th><th>Can the PI be Disclosed?

                                8.6.1.d. <b>California Consumers Rights</b><p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to request access to or deletion of your PI that we have in our records and which were collected or otherwise obtained during the 12-month period preceding your request. You also have the right to instruct us not to sell your PI to Third Parties.</p><p>You may exercise any of these rights either directly or through an authorized representative. If you wish to  make a request regarding your PI via an authorized agent, you must provide this agent with your written permission, which is to be submitted to Dailymotion together with copies of your and your agent’s official IDs at the time of filing a request. We may ask for additional documents or information if we judge them necessary to verify the agent’s authority to act on your behalf, the extent of the authorizations you have granted and to identify your PI.</p><p>Your choice to exercise any of the above-listed rights will not result in any discriminatory treatment. </p></li><li>
                                8.6.1.e. <b>Right to Opt-Out from Sale of Personal Information</b><p>You have the right to “<b>opt-out</b>” of the sale of your PI, which means that you can tell a business to stop selling your PI and to refrain from selling it in the future. Exercising your Opt-Out right does not affect previously sold PI.</p><p>To exercise this right, click on the “<a href="/legal/usprivacy">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>” link available within this Privacy Policy and on our Service. <u>Note that this link may not be visible or functional if you access our Service using a non-California IP address</u> (e.g. while accessing Dailymotion Service from a different state or country or doing so using location-masking technologies such as a proxy or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software).  If you are a California resident and encounter problems in the exercise of your Opt-Out right, such as if you are not physically in California at the time, we invite you to contact us directly using either of the contact methods listed in Section 8.6.1.h. </p><p>Upon exercising your right to Opt-Out, we will cease selling your PI, i.e. we will refrain from disclosing it to Third Parties for their own business purposes. We will also communicate your decision to all Third Parties to whom your PI may have previously been sold during the 90-day period preceding your request.</p><p>Note that while we will not sell your PI once you exercise your Opt-Out right, we may still disclose such information to our business partners in order for them to help us carry out our own business activities. In these circumstances, our business partners will act as our Service Providers and they will not be allowed to use your PI for any purposes other than those we ask them to.</p><p>We remind you that an Opt-Out decision is limited to the device and the browser used. If you use our Service on different devices or via different browsers, your Opt-Out decision needs to be communicated to us separately on each of them and renewed every time the associated Service ID is no longer active.</p><p>Additionally, if your Service ID is no longer recognized by our Service (either because the cookie it is stored in has expired or because you or the technology you use (e.g. your Internet browser) has deleted such cookie or prevented its deployment), we will no longer be capable of either recognizing you or acknowledging that you have opted-out from the sale of your PI.  We invite you to verify your registered options by accessing your CCPA settings through the “<a href="/legal/usprivacy">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>” link and to renew the Opt-Out procedure if needed.</p></li><li>
                                8.6.1.f. <b>Requests to Opt-In After Opting-Out of the Sale of Your PI</b><p>Once you have exercised your right to Opt-Out, it is possible for you to opt back into the sale of your PI. You will be alerted if a transaction requires the sale of your PI in order to complete.</p><p>Opting back into the sale of your PI is an easy two-step process: you just have to request to opt-in and you will then be asked to confirm your choice. You may do so by clicking the “<a href="/legal/usprivacy">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>” link or by using any of the other contact methods described in Section 8.6.1.h below.</p></li><li>

This request can only be made once every 12 months.</p><p>Additionally, you have the right to request the deletion of your PI that Dailymotion collected or maintained during the same 12-month period.</p><p>Upon receipt of your verifiable request to delete your PI, we will proceed with the deletion of such information unless otherwise authorized or required by <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.105.">law</a>.</p></li><li>

The CCPA rights in relation to your PI can only be exercised by you, meaning that your request cannot concern PI that is not yours and no one else can exercise the CCPA rights in relation to your PI (unless acting as an authorized agent on your behalf). Consequently, we need to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person sending us a request, as well as that person’s entitlement to exercise the CCPA rights and to identify the information such request relates to, before we process the request. </p><p>The actual verification process may take different forms depending on the circumstances of your request. For example, if you have a Dailymotion account, you may be asked to reply to a verification email sent to you by our Support Team at the email address you use to login. The Dailymotion Support Policy team will guide you through the applicable procedures.</p></li></ul></li><li>
                        8.6.2. <b>Third Party Marketing Activities</b><p>If you are a California resident, you may be entitled to request disclosure of the categories of PI (such as your name and contact information), if any, that we share with third parties who wish to contact you or send you promotional information about their products and services directly (as compared to when the third party is acting on our behalf or you have provided your PI as part of a co-promotion by Dailymotion and the third party). You may also request the names and addresses of these third parties. Please note that you can only make these requests once per calendar year. </p><p>If you are a California resident and would like to request a copy of this information regarding our disclosure of PI to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, please contact us using the procedure described in Section 8.6.1.h. or send us a letter at: Legal Department, Dailymotion Inc., 50 West 23rd Street, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10010, United States.</p></li><li>
