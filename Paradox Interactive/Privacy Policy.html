<h2>4. Why do we process your personal data and which legal basis do we use?</h2>

<p>We process your personal data for different purposes depending on how you use our Services. Below is an overview of what personal data we process and why.</p>

<p>To be able to fulfill our User Agreement <a href="https://legal.paradoxplaza.com/eula?locale=en">https://legal.paradoxplaza.com/eula?locale=en</a>, we may process your data as necessary to:
• enable you to access the Services;
• troubleshoot and correct errors and bugs in the Services;
• safeguard our Services;
• operate and maintain our Services, for example by making sure that they function as intended; and

• send emails with news, offers and information about our Services;
• provide you with targeted advertisements via our advertising partners;
• connect your Paradox account with your other gaming accounts;
• provide customer support;

• provide you with recommendations, game offers and other targeted marketing via our Services, for example the launcher; and
• provide you with tips and guides via our Services, for example inform you about new “how-to play” videos and other helpful tips on how to play our Games.</p>

<p>Based on our legal obligation, we may process your personal data to:
• verify your identity and age in order to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>5. From where do we collect your personal data?</h2>

<p>Generally, the personal data we collect and otherwise process is provided by you directly or is automatically collected when you use our Services. We collect your personal data from the following sources: </p>

<p>• directly from you when you submit your data to us, for example, when you communicate with us, when you subscribe to emails, newsletters, create a Paradox account, and when you participate in surveys;
• directly from your device by automatic means when you use our Services, for example your IP-address, required telemetry data and gameplay data;
• from distributors of our Games, for example Steam and Epic; and
• from our advertising partners when you interact with our ads outside of our Services.</p>

<h2>6. Who do we share your personal data with?</h2>

<p>To be able to provide you with our Services and give you the best possible experience, we may share your data with our partners. Some of these partners and their servers are located outside of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA&#39;&#39;). Before we transfer any of your personal data to such a service provider, we make sure that we and they will provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data. This may include applying the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data or other safeguards recognized by applicable laws and regulations. Below follows a list of categories of recipients we may share your personal data with: </p>

<p>• video game developers, for example other companies in the Paradox group and external developers which develop and operate our Services;
• external service providers, for example hosting services providers, e-commerce providers, data and analytic service providers, customer engagement service providers, and other providers that help us provide the best possible experience;
• advertising partners, for example Google and Facebook;
• prospective or actual buyers (including their agents or advisors) in the context of a planned or actual acquisition, merger, or other business restructuring, including the sale of individual Games;
• government authorities, for example when we believe that it is necessary to disclose data as a matter of applicable law or regulation;
• other entities, for example when we believe it is necessary to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights to protect you or another person’s vital interest; and
• other companies and entities we collect your consent to share your personal data with.</p>

<p>For more in-depth information, please see our Recipients List <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bqOxlVeQAmn1ptK_ghteEiQXpZ4nejmX/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bqOxlVeQAmn1ptK_ghteEiQXpZ4nejmX/view</a>.</p>

<h2>7. How long will we process your personal data?</h2>

<p>We will process your data for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected. This includes complying with any legal, accounting, and similar requirements. After the applicable retention period has expired, we will either delete or anonymize your data. If neither deletion nor anonymization is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), we will isolate your data from further processing until deletion or anonymization is possible. We may continue to use data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregated data).</p>

<h2>8. Your rights and how to exercise them</h2>

<p>The GDPR and other applicable data protection laws and regulations grant you the right to: 
• access, rectify, or request the erasure of, your data;
• revoke your consent at any time;
• request us to restrict our processing of your personal data;
• object to our processing of your data to the extent our processing is based on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party; 
• request a copy of the personal data you have provided us with (data portability), where such portability is technically feasible; and
• lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

<p>You can exercise your rights by contacting our customer support here <a href="https://support.paradoxplaza.com/hc/en-us">https://support.paradoxplaza.com/hc/en-us</a> and opening a ticket. You need to be logged in to your Paradox account to open a ticket. This is a requirement as we need to verify that the correct person is creating a ticket. Once logged in, you can also change your marketing consent settings and update your personal data directly in the Paradox account settings <a href="https://accounts.paradoxplaza.com/settings">https://accounts.paradoxplaza.com/settings</a>. You can opt out from the processing of Gameplay Data via the settings in game.</p>

<h2>9. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>

<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on our website. Cookies allow us and our partners to recognize your device and improve your experience of our Services. If you interact with our website, marketing will take place on third-party platforms via cookies and similar technologies. We also use website analytics to allow us to count visits and traffic sources for measuring and improving website performance and our marketing. These types of processing are based on your consent.</p>

<p>Please read our Cookie Policy for information on how we use cookies and similar technologies on our websites. </p>

<p>We may also use pixel tracking in our HTML-based marketing emails to determine whether recipients have opened those emails or clicked on links in those emails. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our emails and email marketing campaigns.</p>

<h2>10. Can children use our Services?</h2>

<p>Our Services are intended for users aged 16 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 16. Only individuals who are at least 16 years old are allowed to open a Paradox account. We strongly recommend parents or guardians to instruct their children not to disclose any data online. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from someone under the age of 16, we will promptly delete it, unless we are required by law to retain it.</p>

<h2>11. Note for California residents</h2>

<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), California residents are afforded the following rights regarding their personal information:
• request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose; 
• request deletion of your personal information; 
• opt out of sale of your personal information (if any); and 
• not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. </p>

<p>We do not sell or share any of your personal data to a third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable considerations. </p>

<p>In addition to this section, the preceding sections of this privacy policy are applicable to California residents as well.</p>

<h2>12. Changes</h2>

<p>This Policy may change from time to time. Any changes to this Policy will be posted on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide you with a more distinct notice, for example by email or with a pop-up on our Services or on your Paradox account page. If you are asked to accept material changes to this Policy and decline to do so, you might not be able to continue using the Services with all functionalities preserved.</p>
