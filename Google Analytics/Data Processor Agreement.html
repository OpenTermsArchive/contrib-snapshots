Google may update or modify such Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Processor Services.
</p>

<div>
  <h2>
    <span>1.</span> <strong>Data Centre & Network Security</strong>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      <span>(a)</span> <strong>Data Centres</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Infrastructure</strong>. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Redundancy</strong>. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power</strong>. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator systems take over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Server Operating Systems</strong>. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Businesses Continuity</strong>. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>(b)</span> <strong>Networks & Transmission</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Transmission</strong>. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. Further, Google encrypts data transmitted between data centres.  This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transport. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>External Attack Surface</strong>. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Intrusion Detection</strong>. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span>1.</span> Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>2.</span> Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>3.</span> Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Incident Response</strong>. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Encryption Technologies</strong>. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
    <span>2.</span> <strong>Access and Site Controls</strong>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      <span>(a)</span> <strong>Site Controls</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>On-site Data Centre Security Operation</strong>. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operations personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“<strong>CCTV</strong>”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Centre Access Procedures</strong>. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of authorised data centre personnel. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from authorised data centre personnel for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>On-site Data Centre Security Devices</strong>. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>(b)</span> <strong>Access Control</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Infrastructure Security Personnel</strong>. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Access Control and Privilege Management</strong>. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy</strong>. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising digital certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
    <span>3.</span> <strong>Data</strong>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      <span>(a)</span> <strong>Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.
    </p><span>(b)</span> <strong>Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines</strong>.
    <p>
      Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“<strong>Decommissioned Disk</strong>”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “<strong>Data Destruction Guidelines</strong>”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
    <span>4.</span> <strong>Personnel Security</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate background checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.
  </p>
  <h2>
    <span>5.</span> <strong>Subprocessor Security</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms, subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement).
