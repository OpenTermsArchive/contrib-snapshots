<strong>Are you logged in to your account?  </strong>

<strong>1.
Why is my personal data going to third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>The original version of the Privacy Policy was crafted to cover multiple TP-Link camera product lines, some of which support third-party services such as Amazon Alexa, Google Chromecast streaming.
In order to avoid confusion, we have updated our Privacy Policy &lt;https://www.tplinkcloud.com/PrivacyPolicy.php&gt.
to be more specific for NC model cameras.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your NC model camera using tpCamera app does not support any third-party services or cloud storage.
Your video data can only be stored locally on your camera’s SD card and is not accessible by us or any third-party.</p>
