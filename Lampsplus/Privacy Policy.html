Policy Changes Our Privacy Policy Lamps Plus, Inc.
(“LAMPS PLUS” or “we” or “us”) has created this privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") in order to demonstrate its commitment to user, visitor, subscriber, and customer privacy with regard to the Lamps Plus web site located at lampsplus.
com (the “Website”).
Privacy on the Website is of great importance to us.
Because we gather important information from our users, visitors and customers (collectively “Subscribers” or “you” or “your”), we have established this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.
By accessing the Website, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy and also agree to the Terms of Use of the Website located here.
You can visit most of the pages on LAMPS PLUS without ever telling us who you are, as we do not ask users to register or establish an account with us in order to browse our site.
We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but individual site visitors remain anonymous, unless, at some point, you tell us who you are.
However, when you use our online services like joining LAMPS PLUS Rewards or our e-mail list, saving viewed products in an online Wish List, leaving a product review, entering a sweepstakes, or purchasing a product from us online, you agree to tell us something about yourself.
When you join LAMPS PLUS Rewards or our e-mail list, enter a sweepstakes, or use online services such as our Wish List, you are asked for your e-mail address, name and zip code.
You may also be asked for a street address and other information.
When placing an order on our site, we ask you for contact information like name and shipping address, and payment information like credit card number, expiration date, and customer card identification number.
Without providing information like this you will be unable to order products on our site or use certain online services.
We use the personal information that you provide about yourself for a number of internal purposes, such as confirming your order and maintaining a record of your online product purchases.
We also use your personal information to provide you with certain benefits if you enroll in our LAMPS PLUS Rewards program, and to send you catalogs and information about special promotions.
In addition, we may use your personal information to contact you if we have trouble processing your order.
We also may combine the information you give us online, in our stores, or through our catalogs, including personal information about you and your order.
We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your online shopping experience with us, to communicate with you both on and offline about our products and events that may be of interest to you.
We do not sell, share or rent e-mail addresses to any third parties.
Furthermore, we do not share the credit card information you provide to us with anyone other than your credit card provider.
However, other information about you may be combined with publicly available information, as well as information we receive from reputable companies we have selected to analyze the data we collect.
We do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, LAMPS PLUS, or to others.
We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.
Marketing Partnerships We maintain relationships with select business partners whom we have deemed to be trustworthy and responsible and whose privacy policies are aligned with ours.
We may share or cross-reference data, including personal information (name, street address and transactional information), about you and your order with our business partners, allowing them to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you.
We may also share your personal information with any of our subsidiaries, including our flash sales website.
In addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide services, products, sweepstakes, contests, or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers.
We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.
If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at customerservice@LampsPlus.

Contests and Promotions When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate.
That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
Product and Store Reviews When you leave a product review on our site, the information you provide about yourself, including your e-mail address, is collected for us by a third party vendor.

Privacy and E-Mail Referrals The above rules and code of conduct applies to e-mails that you provide us in the course of using one of our "e-mail to a friend" utilities or "refer a friend" promotions.

back to top | main help Security At LAMPS PLUS, we understand your concerns about security and privacy.
We protect the sensitive information you give us, such as credit card numbers, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you share with us.
This process makes it statistically much safer to shop with us than to use your card in a restaurant or store.
This encryption applies to users viewing our site using up-to-date, modern browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari or Chrome.
back to top | main help Fraudulent Charge Protection LAMPS PLUS offers a "Safe Shopping Guarantee.
" If a third party obtains your personal information from a purchase made with LAMPS PLUS and uses that information to perpetrate credit card fraud, you are protected.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank may hold you liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges.
If your bank holds you liable for any portion of the $50, LAMPS PLUS will cover up to the entire $50.
LAMPS PLUS will cover this liability if the unauthorized use resulted through no fault of yours from a purchase made on the LAMPS PLUS secure server.
In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
back to top | main help Cookies Like many other online retailers, LAMPS PLUS uses a technology called "cookies".
A cookie is a small bit of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive that we use to help us retrieve data you may have stored with us.
For example, in our "Wish List" section, we use cookies to help us retrieve the lighting products that you have saved in these areas.
The "Help" portion on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to delete your computer's cookies or how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies.
However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the LAMPS PLUS website, and we recommend that you leave the feature turned on.
LAMPS PLUS may occasionally use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.
These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous and is not relatable to you.
These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our advertising service providers.
However, LAMPS PLUS respects your privacy and your right to choose whether to be included in such services.
If you would like more information or would like to learn about your ability to unsubscribe of this type of practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here.
