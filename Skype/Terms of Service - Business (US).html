</p> 2.
Emergency Calls <p>
<strong>2.1 No Emergency Calls.</strong> The Skype Software does not support any emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any type of emergency services of any kind, except in the very limited circumstances described in paragraph 2.3 below.
Skype is not a traditional telephone service or a replacement for Your primary telephone service.
There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Skype Software and the Skype Products.
You need to make additional arrangements in order to access emergency services.
It is Your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Skype Software and the Skype Products, traditional wireless or fixed line telephone services that offer access to emergency services.
It is Your responsibility to inform Your Users that it is not possible to support or carry emergency calls using the Skype Software and the Skype Products, and that they may access emergency services via the additional arrangements that You have made available to Your Users.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2 Not a Standalone Service.</strong> Business Products that enable communications via Your PBX should not be used as a standalone service but as a secondary communications channel only in connection with traditional telephone services.
When using Business Products You shall configure Your PBX so that all emergency calls are placed through a standard landline connection or some other type of telephone services that support emergency calling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3 Limited Emergency Calling:</strong> Skype will use reasonable endeavors to provide limited emergency calling in a very limited number of countries, and only where a Business Account is being used for Individual Use by a Business User who is using the Skype Software version 4.1 for Windows (or later) or version 3.0 for Mac OS X (or later) (“ Enabled Versions”).
Skype does not provide emergency calling for or in conjunction with any Business Products, Skype Products or on any platforms, devices or operating systems other than those Enabled Versions explicitly referred to in this paragraph 2.3.
The following limitations apply in respect of emergency calling on Enabled Versions: </p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.1</strong> Skype cannot guarantee that the emergency calling will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections, or at all.
Where enabled, emergency calling will be transmitted through public Internet lines and the public switched telephone network ("PSTN").
Consequently, there may be power outages or Internet service disruption and You may experience some disruptions e.g.
packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of Your communication.
Furthermore, Skype cannot guarantee that You or Your Business Users will always be able to communicate with other people, nor can Skype guarantee that You or Your Business Users can communicate without disruptions, delays or communication-related flaws or that all Your communications shall always be delivered to other people.
Any of these limitations may adversely affect successful call connection </p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.2</strong> An emergency call made using the Enabled Versions of Skype Software, in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.3</strong> If the emergency call of a Business User is connected, such Business User will be required orally to provide their physical location to a third party emergency services operative to enable the correct emergency organization to respond to the emergency.
If the Business User does not provide this information when prompted, You acknowledge that the emergency call of Your Business User may not be completed and such Business User will not be able to gain access to the required emergency service using their Business Account.
Skype will have no liability for any failed emergency call in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.4</strong> You expressly acknowledge the service limitations described above and agree to continue to make alternative arrangements in order for Your Business Users to access emergency services through a traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone service, and only use emergency calling in the Enabled Versions of Skype Software as an absolute last resort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.5</strong> You can find out whether limited emergency calling functionality is available in the country in which Your Business Users are located by setting the default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of the applicable Business Account that is using one of the Enabled Versions of the Skype Software.
It is Your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if the physical address of Your Business User changes.
Emergency calls are not supported by the Skype Software in the majority of countries around the world.
If the countries in which Your Business Users are located are not supported for limited emergency calling access then the provisions of paragraphs 2.1 and 10.1.3 (A) continue to apply and You should ensure that Your Business Users do not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using the Skype Software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3.6</strong> You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to inform, and You shall inform, Your Business Users about the service limitations and the obligations referred to in paragraph 2.3.5 above regarding the Call Settings page of their Business Account.
</p> 3.
Quality, Technical Improvement and Maintenance <p>
<strong>3.1 Quality:</strong> Skype will use reasonable endeavors to provide the Skype Products with minimum disruptions.
However, Skype cannot guarantee that the Skype Products will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections.
Since the Skype Products work over public internet lines and the PSTN, there may be power outages or internet service disruption and You may experience some disruptions e.g.
packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of Your communications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2 Technical improvement and maintenance:</strong> Skype may change technical features in order to keep pace with the latest demands and technological developments or to comply with any Applicable Laws.
Skype may also have to repair, improve, and/or upgrade the Skype Products and this may require us to restrict, limit, suspend, interfere and/or interrupt the Skype Products at any time in our sole discretion.
</p> 4.
No Reselling <p> Skype Products are made available under this Agreement solely for use by You and Your Business Users for Your communications purposes.
The use of the Skype Products for any other purpose, and/or the resale of any Skype Products is not permitted by You or any of Your Administrators or Business Users, and You shall not (and shall ensure that Your Administrators and Business Users shall not) resell the Skype Products to any third party or use the Skype Products to provide services to any third party.
