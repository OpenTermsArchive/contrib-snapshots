Any Online Numbers and Skype Credit that You have allocated to that Business Account may be taken back to the Skype Manager and reallocated before the Business Account is deleted.
You may take the Online Numbers back by manually removing them from the Business Account.

It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Business Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data.

If you are an Administrator creating or managing a Skype Manager but not entering into this Agreement on behalf of a legally incorporated entity or you are not authorized to represent or act on behalf of such entity, then you shall be in breach of this Agreement and shall be personally liable for such breach and any other breach of this Agreement, and for any acts and omissions of any Business Users or Administrators on your Skype Manager.
