Content, material or actions that violate these Terms are not permitted. By agreeing to these Terms, you’re under the obligation to follow these rules:
<ul><li>i. Don’t do anything illegal.</li><li>ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children.</li><li>iii. Don’t send spam. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages) or instant messages.</li><li>iv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to share any inappropriate content or other material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence or criminal activity).</li><li>v. Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g. asking for money under false pretences, impersonating someone else, manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings or comments).</li><li>vi. Don’t willfully circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Services.</li><li>vii.

In addition, if you violate any of the obligations listed in section 3(a) above or otherwise materially violate these Terms, we may take action against you including (without limitation) stopping providing Services or closing your Microsoft account immediately for good cause or blocking delivery of a communication (like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. We also reserve the right to remove or block Your Content from the Services at any time if it is brought to our attention that it may violate applicable law or these Terms. When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue. However, we do not monitor the Services and make no attempt to do so.</li><li>c. <strong>Application to Xbox Services.</strong> Click <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=868531" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about how this Code of Conduct applies to Xbox Live, Xbox Game Pass, Games for Windows Live and Xbox Games Studios games, applications, services and content provided by Microsoft. Violation of the Code of Conduct through Xbox Services (defined in section 13(a)(i)) may result in suspensions or bans from participation in Xbox Services, including forfeiture of content licences, Xbox Gold Membership time and Microsoft account balances associated with the account.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description LongDescription" loc="true"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Using the Services &amp; Support</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Using the Services &amp; Support</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">4_usingTheServicesSupport</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p>4. <strong>Using the Services &amp; Support.</strong></p><ul><li>a. <strong>Microsoft account.</strong> You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.
				<ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">i. <strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet Service Provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ii. <strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738</a> or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services or as otherwise required by law. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. You must sign in to the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website (<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656</a>).</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iii. <strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By signing up, you represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please do not create a Microsoft account before you have asked your parent or legal guardian for help and consent. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor who creates a Microsoft account, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and you are responsible for supervising your minor in the use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.</li><li>iv. <strong>Closing Your Account.</strong><ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">1. In addition to any rights you have to cancel as specified in the "Refund Policy" section below (section 9(g)), you can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278</a>. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. See section 4(a)(iv)(2) below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result, you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services) that require a Microsoft account. You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. Fourth, we may temporarily prevent creation of an account associated with the email address you provided. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">b. <strong>Work or School Accounts.</strong> You can sign in to certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organisation and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">c. <strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you’ll need an Internet connection and/or data/mobile plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">d. <strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications and information the law requires us to provide. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). <strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong> We recommend you monitor and maintain the email address you specified. If you don't consent to receive notices electronically, you must stop using the Services.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">e. <strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com</a>. You may also send a notice to Microsoft following the procedures detailed in the Notices section of these Terms. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement</a>, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services. If you live in Europe you can also refer a complaint to the EU’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank">Online Dispute Resolution platform</a>; please use <a href="mailto:MSODR@microsoft.com">MSODR@microsoft.com</a> on the complaint form only and not for another purpose.</li><li>f. <strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are cancelled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your licence to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result, you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have cancelled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be cancelled immediately.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Using Third-Party Apps and Services</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Using Third-Party Apps and Services</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">5_usingThird-PartyAppsAndServices</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p>5. <strong>Using Third-Party Apps and Services.</strong> The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent third parties (companies or people who aren’t Microsoft) ("<strong>Third-Party Apps and Services</strong>"). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact with Third-Party Apps and Services or allow you to share Your Content or Data, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 13(b) for additional terms for applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows). You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting, or linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services.

The Services, Third Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered on a limited basis, or may vary depending on your region or device. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may need to re-acquire the products that were available to you and paid for in your previous region.</li><li>b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages. In the event of an outage or disruption to the Service, you may temporarily not be able to retrieve Your Content. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">7_updatesToTheServicesOrSoftwareAndChangesToTheseTerms</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p>7. <strong>Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms.</strong></p><ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">a. We'll inform you if we intend to change these Terms. We may change these Terms if it is necessary due to (i) applicable law, including, but not limited to, a change of such law; (ii) an advice and/or order based on applicable law; (iii) the evolution of the Services; (iv) technical reasons; (v) operational requirements or (vi) an advantageous change of terms for the user. We'll inform you of the intended change before it takes effect, either through the user interface, in an email message or through other reasonable means. We'll provide you the opportunity to cancel the Services at least 30 days before the change becomes effective. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services and close your Microsoft account in accordance with section 4(a)(iv). We'll also expressly point to this fact when informing you about the intended change of these Terms.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">b. We may automatically check your version of the software, which is necessary to provide the Services, and download software updates or configuration changes, without charging you, to update, enhance and further develop the Services. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates shall be subject to these Terms unless additional or other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. If you decline to accept the additional or other terms applicable to the updates, you may not receive or use the updates. Microsoft isn't obligated to make any updates available and doesn't guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other products.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">c. We continuously work to improve the Services and may change the Services or delete features or stop providing access to Third-Party Apps and Services in that respect at any time, including, without limitation, if our agreements with third parties no longer permit us to make their material available, if it is no longer feasible for us to provide it, the technology advances, or if customer feedback indicates a change is needed. We will notify you in advance if a change to the Services will cause you to lose access to Your Content. For paid Services, we'll also notify you in advance of other material changes to the Services. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 13(k)) or applications previously purchased. If we cancel a paid Service, we’ll refund to you on a pro-rata basis the amount of payments that you've made corresponding to the portion of that Service remaining right before the cancellation.</li><li>d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, films, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Software Licence</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Software Licence</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">8_softwareLicense</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p>8. <strong>Software Licence.</strong> Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft licence agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft Software Licence Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 13(b)(i) below.</p><ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">a. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code.

The price stated for the Services includes all applicable taxes, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered, unless stated otherwise. <strong>After we have given you notice that we did not receive an on-time, full payment from you, we may suspend or cancel the Services if you do not make the full payment within the relevant time.</strong> Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.

Your bank might charge you additional fees for those services when you use a debit or credit card. Please contact your bank for details.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">b. <strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.

Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. If you tell us to stop using your payment method and don't provide us with another payment method after our notice to you to do so within an appropriate timeframe, we may suspend or cancel your paid Service for good cause. Changes made to your billing account won't affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">c. <strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorised to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. As specified, we may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services and, in the case of a price change, provide you with the opportunity to cancel the Services before the price changes. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">d. <strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorising recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorising recurring payments, you are authorising Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, "<strong>Electronic Payments</strong>"). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">e. <strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> For all Services other than Skype, Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282" target="_blank">Microsoft account management website</a>, where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing in to your account at <a href="https://www.skype.com">www.skype.com</a>. This is the only billing statement that we provide. An invoice with VAT may be made available depending on the Service and country. If we make an error on your bill, we’ll correct it promptly after you tell us (or we notice it) and we investigate the charge. We recommend that you tell us within 120 days after an obvious error first appears on your bill as it is easier for us to resolve the issue during that period. You can address your requests for these purposes to the customer support service, as indicated in section 4(e). </li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">f. <strong>Refund Policy.</strong> You will be entitled to a cancellation period (a "<strong>Cooling-Off Period</strong>") of fourteen (14) days from the day of purchase, with or without cause. If the Service is partly delivered at the time of cancellation, you will get a pro-rated refund. You acknowledge the Cooling-Off Period ends at the time the Service is fully delivered to you, then your purchase cannot be refunded. When you purchase digital content from us, you will cease to have the right to cancel from the moment when you begin the download. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. For all Services other than Skype, information and directions on how to cancel a Service and request a refund using our Withdrawal Form, if you are entitled to a refund, is provided on <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618284" target="_blank">Microsoft account management website</a>. For Skype, please complete the Withdrawal Form using the information provided <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286" target="_blank">here</a>. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact Microsoft and we will investigate the charge. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any rights under applicable law. For more refund information, please visit our <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283" target="_blank">help topic</a>.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">g. <strong>Terminating the Services.</strong> You may cancel the Services on the services and subscriptions management page in your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft account</a> or by contacting customer service as described above in section 4(e). Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your Services end at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you cancelled.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">h. <strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">i. <strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if you breach the terms and conditions of the offer.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">j. <strong>Price Changes.</strong> If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the term. You will need to agree to any new offer and price if you want to continue the Services. If your Services are on a periodic basis (for example, monthly), with no specific time length, and isn't a trial offer, we may change the price of the Services if we add new or improved Service features, to the extent the costs of providing the Service have increased accordingly, or in response to market changes (for example, due to labour costs, currency fluctuations, changes in taxes/regulations, inflation, licence fees, infrastructure and administrative costs). We will inform you at least 30 days before the price change becomes effective. You will have the opportunity to cancel the Services before the price changes in accordance with Section 9(h) above. When we notify you of the price change, we'll also inform you of the reasons and scope of the increase in prices and that the new price will become effective if you don't cancel the Services, and we’ll also remind you of how you can cancel the Services.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">k. <strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. <strong>If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust it for any previous overpayment.</strong></li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">l. <strong>Late payments.</strong> In case of late payments, you must pay for the reasonable costs we incur to collect any past due amounts including lawyers' fees and other legal fees and costs, as permitted by law and regulations. We may suspend or cancel your Services if you fail to pay in full on time after we send you a reminder – with the threat of suspension and/or cancellation of the Services – to make your payment within an appropriate time. You can avoid suspension or cancellation if you make the required payment within the appropriate time set forth in the reminder. A different procedure will apply if the amount missing is marginal. Amounts missing below 2 per cent of the total invoice value will always be deemed marginal. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in the loss of access to your Microsoft account.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">m. <strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618288" target="_blank">Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions</a>. Information on Skype gift cards is available on <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383" target="_blank">Skype’s Help page</a>. </li><li>n. <strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g. a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("<strong>ACH</strong>") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area ("<strong>SEPA</strong>") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the "mandate" in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorised to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorise Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorise the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4(e) as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorised transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Contracting Entity, Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Contracting Entity, Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">10_11_contractingEntityChoiceOfLaw</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p>10. <strong>Contracting Entity, Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes.</strong> If you live in (or, if you are a business, your principal place of business is in) Europe, and you are using cost-free or paid Services, you are contracting with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland (registered at the Companies Registration Office in Ireland under number 256796, VAT registration number: IE 8256796 U, with a registered address of 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland).

If you choose to link your Microsoft Xbox Services account with your account on a non-Microsoft service (for example, a non-Microsoft game publisher of Third-Party Apps and Services), you agree that: (a) Microsoft may share limited account information (including without limitation gamertag, gamerscore, game score, game history and friends list), with that non-Microsoft party as stated in the Microsoft Privacy Statement, and (b) if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, the non-Microsoft party may also have access to Your Content from in-game communications when you are signed in to your account with that non-Microsoft party. Also, if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, Microsoft can publish your name, gamertag, gamerpic, motto, avatar, gameclips and games that you’ve played in communications to people you allow.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iii. <strong>Your Content.</strong> As part of building the Xbox Services community, you grant to Microsoft, its affiliates and sublicensees a free and worldwide right, to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, broadcast, share and display Your Content or your name, gamertag, gamerpic, motto or avatar that you posted for any Xbox Services in whole or in part by any means or processes on any materials or support.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iv. <strong>Game Managers.</strong> Some games may use game managers and hosts.

Microsoft may change its offerings around game currency or virtual goods from time to time.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">vii. <strong>Software Updates.</strong> For any device that can connect to Xbox Services, we may automatically check your version of Xbox console software or the Xbox app software and download Xbox console or Xbox app software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Xbox Services, using unauthorised Xbox games or Xbox apps, or using unauthorised hardware peripheral devices with an Xbox console.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">viii. <strong>Gamertag Expiry.</strong> You must sign in to Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period, otherwise you may lose access to the gamertag associated with your account and that gamertag may become available for use by others.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ix. <strong>Arena.</strong> Arena is an Xbox Service by which Microsoft or a third party may offer you the ability to participate in or create a competitive videogame contest, sometimes for a prize ("<strong>Contest</strong>"). Your use of Arena is subject to these Terms, and may require you to accept additional Contest terms, conditions and rules required by the Contest organiser at the time of sign-up ("<strong>Contest Terms</strong>"). Eligibility rules may apply, and may vary by jurisdiction. Contests are void where prohibited or restricted by law. Violation of these Terms (including the Code of Conduct) or Contest Terms may result in a penalty or disqualification from the Contest. If you create a Contest, you may not require any Contest Rules that Microsoft (in its sole discretion) deems inconsistent with these Terms.

These Terms cover use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox). "<strong>Office Store</strong>" means a Store for Office products and apps for Office, Office 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later) or any other experience that is branded Office Store. "<strong>Microsoft Store on Windows</strong>" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows devices such as phone, PC and tablet or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC or tablet. "<strong>Microsoft Store on Xbox</strong>" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox One or Xbox 360 consoles or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on Xbox console.<ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">i. <strong>Licence Terms.</strong> We will identify the publisher of each application available in the relevant Store. Unless different licence terms are provided with the application, the Standard Application Licence Terms (<strong>"SALT"</strong>) at the end of these Terms are an agreement between you and the application publisher setting forth the licence terms that apply to an application you download through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (excluding the Office Store). For clarity, these Terms cover the use of, and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5 of these Terms also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a Store. Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed by the SALT and have separate licence terms that apply.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ii. <strong>Updates.</strong> Microsoft will automatically check for and download updates to your applications, even if you are not signed into the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if you prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. However, certain Office Store applications that are entirely or partly hosted online may be updated at any time by the application developer and may not require your permission to update.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iii. <strong>Ratings and Reviews.</strong> If you submit a rating or review for an application or other Digital Good in the Store, you may receive email from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share your email address with publishers of applications or other Digital Goods you acquire through the Store.</li><li>iv. <strong>Safety Warning.</strong> To avoid possible injury, discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic breaks from use of games or other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break. Discomfort might include feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain or dry eyes. Using applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the applications if you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures. Parents should monitor their children’s use of applications for signs of symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Microsoft Family Features</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Microsoft Family Features</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">14c_MicrosoftFamily</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><ul><li>c. <strong>Microsoft Family Features.</strong> Parents and kids can use Microsoft family features to build trust based on a shared understanding of what behaviours, websites, apps, games, physical locations and spending is right in their family.

Microsoft is not required to offer access to Emergency Services for Skype software and products under any applicable local or national rules, regulations or law. Skype software and products are not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care units or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (<strong>"Emergency Services"</strong>). Skype software and products may support calls to Emergency Services in a very limited number of countries, and for limited software versions and platforms only. You can find details about availability and how to configure this feature here: <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/emergency/">https://www.skype.com/go/emergency</a>. If your emergency call is connected, you will need to provide details of your physical location to enable the emergency services to respond to you. Microsoft does not guarantee that your emergency call will be connected. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) it is your responsibility to purchase, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (ii) Skype software and products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/emergency">www.skype.com/go/emergency</a>.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ii. <strong>Changes to Skype paid products.</strong> If we make changes to Skype paid products which are detrimental to you, we’ll give you at least thirty days’ notice of the changes and inform you of your right to terminate the affected product before it changes. If you do not terminate the product before the changes take effect, you agree to the changes. We will expressly inform you of this fact when we notify you.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iii. <strong>APIs or Broadcasting.</strong> If you want to use Skype in connection with any broadcast, you must comply with the "Broadcast TOS" at <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast" target="_blank">https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast</a>. If you want to use any application program interface ("<strong>API</strong>") exposed or made available by Microsoft you must comply with the applicable licensing terms, which are available at <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/legal" target="_blank">www.skype.com/go/legal</a>.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">iv. <strong>Fair Use Policies.</strong> Fair usage policies may apply to your use of Skype software and products. Please review these policies which are designed to protect against fraud and abuse and may place limits on the type, duration or volume of calls or messages that you are able to make. These policies are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You can find these policies at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615381" target="_blank">https://www.skype.com/go/terms.fairusage</a>.
                    </li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">v. <strong>Mapping.</strong> Skype software and products contain features that allow you to submit information to, or plot yourself on a map using, a mapping service. By using those features, you agree to these Terms and the Google Maps terms available at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/help/terms_maps.html" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/help/terms_maps.html</a>.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">vi. <strong>Personal/Noncommercial Use.</strong> The use of Skype software and products is for your personal and non-commercial use. You are permitted to use Skype at work for your own business communications.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">vii. <strong>Skype Number/Skype To Go.</strong> If Microsoft provides you with a Skype Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. In certain countries, a number may be made available to you by a Microsoft partner rather than Microsoft, and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">viii. <strong>Skype Manager.</strong> A "Skype Manager Admin Account" is created and managed by you, acting as an individual administrator of a Skype Manager group and not as a business entity. You may link your individual Microsoft account to a Skype Manager group ("<strong>Linked Account</strong>"). You may appoint additional administrators to your Skype Manager subject to their acceptance of these Terms. If you allocate Skype Numbers to a Linked Account, you are responsible for compliance with any requirements related to the residency or location of your Linked Account users. If you choose to unlink a Linked Account from a Skype Manager group, any allocated subscriptions, Skype Credit or Skype Numbers will not be retrievable and Your Content or material associated with the unlinked account will no longer be accessible by you. You agree to process any personal information of your Linked Account users in accordance with all applicable data protection laws.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">ix. <strong>Skype Charges and Refunds.</strong> The charges payable for calling phones outside of a subscription consist of a connection fee (charged once per call) and a per-minute rate as set out on <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/allrates">www.skype.com/go/allrates</a>. Call charges will be deducted from you Skype Credit balance. Microsoft may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers that are not part of a subscription. If the changes are substantial and not advantageous to you (e.g. if we increase the rates), we will inform you by email or in some other appropriate manner at least thirty (30) days before the rate changes take effect. After thirty (30) days, the new rates will apply to your next call. You can find the current rates at <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/allrates">www.skype.com/go/allrates</a>. If you do not accept the new rates you should not make a call. Fractional call minutes and fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the next whole unit. All prices for Skype paid products are inclusive of applicable taxes, including VAT, unless otherwise stated. VAT is calculated based on the billing address provided. You explicitly waive any right to VAT reimbursement from Microsoft if the amount of VAT ultimately payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower than the amount of VAT collected from you. Skype paid products are not available to customers in Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Büsingen / Buesingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Livigno, Campione d'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano. If you have made use of a Skype paid product, your Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded. Expenditure of Skype Credit, allocation of a Skype Number or use of a subscription amounts to ‘full delivery’ and/or ‘use’ of a Skype paid product. You expressly agree that Skype Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period and become non-refundable upon allocation. Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only unused or unexpired Skype subscriptions are refundable subject to these Terms. The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Skype paid products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner; (ii) paid for in cash using third party payment methods (such as a cash payment wallet); (iii) not directly purchased online from Microsoft (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) or (iv) allocated to your account by a third party.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">x. <strong>Skype Credit.</strong> Microsoft does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Skype paid products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180-days, Microsoft will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link at <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit" target="_blank">https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit</a>. You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your settings in your account portal in Skype.</li><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">xi. <strong>International Message Fees.</strong> GroupMe currently uses US-based numbers for each group created. Every text message sent to or received from a GroupMe number will count as an international text message sent to or received from the United States. Please check with your provider for the associated international rates.</li><li> xii. <strong>Send and receive money.</strong> By using the send and receive money feature (if available), you acknowledge that Microsoft uses third parties to provide payment services and effect transfers. Microsoft does not provide payment services or effect transfers and is not a money services business. Sending and receiving money on Skype may only be available to users who are 18 years old and over (or otherwise in accordance with the third parties’ terms) and who register and are approved for an account with the third party provider. To use the send money feature, you may be required to sign up to the third parties’ terms and conditions and to provide permissions to share data with these third parties for the purposes of providing the service. If Microsoft receives notice that your use of the send money feature violates a third party’s terms and conditions, Microsoft may have to take action against your account, such as cancelling or suspending your account. Microsoft will not be liable for payment services provided by third parties or any actions taken under third parties’ terms and conditions. Microsoft makes no guarantees, representations or warranties that the send and receive money feature will be available or continue to be available.</li></ul></li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Bing and MSN</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Bing and MSN</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">14f_BingandMSN</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><ul><li>f. <strong>Bing and MSN.</strong><ul><li style="margin-bottom:1em;">i. <strong>Bing and MSN Materials.</strong> The articles, text, photos, maps, videos, video players and third-party material available on Bing and MSN, including through Microsoft bots, applications and programs, are for your non-commercial, personal use only.

HealthVault accounts are not for use by healthcare providers or for any other commercial or non-personal purpose. The information in your account may not always be accurate or up-to-date and should be viewed by any healthcare provider as informational only. The HealthVault Service does not hold records for healthcare providers or other medical or case management purposes. For example, HealthVault records are not designated record sets as defined under US regulations. If a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from HealthVault in its records, it should store a copy in its own system. If there is a co-custodian of a record in your account (because one of you invited the other), you acknowledge that the co-custodian has full control over that record and may cancel your access to the record, manage other peoples' access to the record and view the record's data including how and when the record is used. Microsoft does not support non-Microsoft credentials (such as Facebook and OpenID), so HealthVault customer support will not be able to help with sign-in issues for those. If you lose your sign-in credentials, or if the account where you got your credentials closes, you will not be able to recover your stored data. To help maintain continued access, we suggest you use more than one sign-in credential with your HealthVault account.

You assume full responsibility for your use of health bots. Microsoft is not responsible for any decision you make based on information you receive from health bots. You should always consult a doctor with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, diet, fitness or wellness programme before using health bots. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information that you accessed on or through the Services.

				i. Microsoft Rewards (the "<strong>Program</strong>") enables you to earn redeemable points for activities such as qualified searches, acquisitions and other offers from Microsoft. Offers may vary by market. A search is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind ("<strong>Search</strong>"). An acquisition is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a licence for digital content from Microsoft, whether free or paid ("<strong>Acquisition</strong>"). Rewards points are not offered for every purchase from Microsoft. Microsoft may offer additional opportunities to earn points from time to time, and each points-earning offer will not be available in perpetuity. Your earned points can be redeemed for items ("<strong>Rewards</strong>") in the redeem page. For more information see the Rewards section at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank">support.microsoft.com</a> ("<strong>FAQ</strong>").
				<ul><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">1. <em>Programme Requirements.</em> You need a valid Microsoft account and your devices must meet the <a href="https://www.bing.com/rewards/faq#WilltheBingbarworkonmycomputerandbrowser" target="_blank">minimum system requirements</a>. The Programme is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQs. Individuals can have no more than one Programme account, even if an individual has multiple email addresses and households are limited to six accounts. The Programme is solely for your personal and non-commercial use.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">2. <em>Points.</em> Except for sharing points within your Microsoft family (limits may apply) or donating your points to a nonprofit organisation listed in the redemption centre, you cannot transfer points. Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis. You cannot purchase points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household or over a set period (e.g. a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith. You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Programme. Points earned in the Programme are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other programme offered by Microsoft or third parties. <strong>Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 18 months.</strong></li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">3. <em>Rewards.</em> You may redeem your points by visiting the redeem page or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organisation. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or freephone number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards. Once you have ordered a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points. Microsoft may update the Rewards offered on the redeem page or discontinue offering specific Rewards. Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements. Any such requirements will be included in the relevant offer. You are responsible for all federal, state and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward. Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards are not for resale.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">4. <em>Cancelling Your Participation in the Programme.</em> Your Programme account may be cancelled if you do not log in at least once in an 18-month period. Additionally, Microsoft reserves the right to cancel the Programme account of a specific user for tampering with, abusing or defrauding the Programme, or for breach of these terms. Upon Programme cancellation (by you or us) or if the Programme is suspended, you will have 90 days to redeem your points; otherwise, those points will be forfeited. At the point of cancellation, your right to use the Programme and accrue future points ends.  </li><li>5. <em>Other Conditions.</em> Microsoft reserves the right to disqualify you; disable your access to the Programme or your Rewards account; and/or withhold points, Rewards and charitable contributions, if Microsoft believes you are tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Programme or may be engaging in activities that violate these Terms.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Azure</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Azure</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">14n_Azure</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><ul><li>n. <strong>Azure.</strong> Your use of the Azure service is governed by the terms and conditions of the separate agreement under which you obtained the services, as detailed at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=522330" target="_blank">https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=522330</a>.</li></ul></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span loc="true" class="Description LongDescription"></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span loc="true" class="Header">Miscellaneous</span><span loc="true" class="navigationHeader">Miscellaneous</span><span loc="false" class="FileName">16_17_18_miscellaneous</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span loc="true" class="Description ShortDescription"><p style="padding-bottom:.5em">14. <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 16 and those that by their terms apply after it ends will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms.
