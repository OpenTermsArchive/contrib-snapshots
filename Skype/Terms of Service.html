<p>It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:</p> <p><b>NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES:</b> The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype&rsquo;s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.</p> <p><b>CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE:</b> In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located.</p> <p><b>NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS:</b> If Skype allocates to you a Skype Number (previously known as &ldquo;Online Number&rdquo;) or Skype To Go Number, you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Skype Number or Skype To Go Number to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing a Skype Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 19.1.</p> <p><b>SKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS:</b> If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. Please see also paragraph 9.2.</p> <p><b>ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</b> If you live in the USA and select Pay by Mobile (see paragraph 20), a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver affects your rights to resolve a dispute with Skype, its corporate affiliates, or other third parties including mobile phone carriers. Please read paragraph 20.3 carefully.</p> <h2><a name="1"></a><b>1. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE</b></h2> <p><b>1.1</b> Skype&rsquo;s internet communication software applications (&ldquo;<b>Internet Communications Software</b>&rdquo;), other &ldquo;Skype&rdquo; branded software applications (together the &ldquo;<b>Skype Software</b>&rdquo;), the &ldquo;<b>Qik</b>&rdquo; branded software applications (&ldquo;<b>Qik Software</b>&rdquo;) and associated documentation (whether in printed or electronic form) including any improvements, modifications, enhancements, fixes, updates, upgrades and future versions thereto (&ldquo;<b>Updates</b>&rdquo;) and whether made available for free or for a fee, (collectively the &ldquo;<b>Software</b>&rdquo;) are licensed (not sold) to you by Skype Software Sàrl.</p> <p><b>1.2</b> The features and products that are made available through the Software for free (excluding products or features available for free on a trial basis only) (&ldquo;<b>Free Products</b>&rdquo;) are provided to you by Skype Software Sàrl.</p> <p><b>1.3</b> Any additional products or features of the Skype Software or Qik Software, or other &ldquo;Skype&rdquo; or &ldquo;Qik&rdquo; branded products, that you pay for (including products or features available for free on a trial basis only) (&ldquo;<b>Paid For Products</b>&rdquo;) are provided to you by Skype Communications Sàrl.</p> <p><b>1.4</b> &ldquo;Skype Websites&rdquo; means www.skype.com, www.qik.com (both of which are operated by Skype Communications Sàrl) and any other websites authorised by Skype which link to these Terms.</p> <p><b>1.5 &ldquo;Skype&rsquo;&rsquo;</b> means Skype Software Sàrl, 23 &ndash; 29 Rives de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg or Skype Communications Sàrl, 23 &ndash; 29 Rives de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg as the context requires;<br /> <b>&ldquo;Products&rdquo;</b> means collectively the Free Products and Paid For Products;<br /> <b>&ldquo;you&rdquo;</b> or <b>&ldquo;your&rdquo;</b> means you, the registered holder of the User Account (as described in paragraph 6.1) and licensee under these Terms.</p> <p><b>1.6</b> Your agreement with Skype is made up of the terms and conditions set out in this document, together with any fair usage policies described in this document and Additional Terms referred to in paragraph 14 (collectively the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). To the extent of any inconsistency between the fair usage policies or any Additional Terms and this document, this document shall take precedence.</p> <h2><a name="2"></a><b>2. ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS</b></h2> <p><b>2.1</b> In order to download and/or use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites you must first accept these Terms. These Terms are accepted by you (a) when you click to accept or agree to the Terms; or (b) when you download and/or use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites. We advise you to print a copy of these Terms for your records. These Terms remain effective from the date of acceptance until terminated by you or Skype in accordance with paragraph 11.</p> <p><b>2.2</b> You cannot accept these Terms if: (a) you are not lawfully entitled to use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites in the country in which you are located or reside or (b) if you are not of legal age to form a binding agreement with Skype.</p> <p><b>2.3</b> In some countries the Products may be provided to you by Skype&rsquo;s local partner. If so, that local partner may ask you to accept its own terms of service (<b>&ldquo;local terms&rdquo;</b>). If there is any inconsistency between those local terms and these Terms, then the local terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><a name="3"></a><b>3. CHANGES TO THE TERMS</b></h2> <p><b>3.1</b> Skype may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Skype will publish the changes at www.skype.com/go/tou. Changes to the fair usage policies and/or Additional Terms will be posted on the applicable Skype Website. The changes will be effective when published. Please review the Terms on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your express acceptance of the Terms or your use of the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites after the date of publication shall constitute your agreement to the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the amended Terms, you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11 below.</p> <h2><a name="4"></a><b>4. LICENCE</b></h2> <p><b style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">4.1</b><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"> </span><b style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">Licence</b><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, free of charge license to download and install the Software on a personal computer, mobile phone or other device; and personally use the Software through your individual Skype or Qik user account (as applicable) (&ldquo;</span><b style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">User Account</b><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', 'Segoe UI Regular', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Tahoma, 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">&rdquo;). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) IT administrators working on behalf of a company may download and install the Skype Software onto personal computers or other devices used by personnel of such company; and (b) you are permitted to use the Software at a university or other educational institution, or at work. Skype reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms.</span></p> <p><b>4.2 Restrictions.</b> You may not and you agree not to:</p> <p>(a) sub-license, sell, assign, rent, lease, export, import, distribute or transfer or otherwise grant rights to any third party in the Software;</p> <p>(b) undertake, cause, permit or authorise the modification, creation of derivative works or improvements, translation, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, decryption, emulation, hacking, discovery or attempted discovery of the source code or protocols of the Software or any part or features thereof (except to the extent permitted by law);</p> <p>(c) remove, obscure or alter any copyright notices or other proprietary notices included in the Software;</p> <p>(d) use the Software or cause the Software (or any part of it) to be used within or to provide commercial products or services to third parties. The foregoing shall not preclude you using the Software for your own business communications, subject to paragraph 4.1 above;</p> <p>(e) other than for the purposes of download and installation, use the Software except through your User Account.</p> <p><b>4.3 Third-Party Technology.</b> If you are using Software pre-loaded on, embedded in, combined, distributed or used with or downloaded onto third party products, hardware, software applications, programs or devices (&ldquo;<b>Third-Party Technology</b>&rdquo;), you agree and acknowledge that: (a) you may be required to enter into a separate licence agreement with the relevant third party owner or licensor for the use of such Third-Party Technology; (b) some Products and/or functionality may not be accessible through the Third-Party Technology and (c) Skype cannot guarantee that the Software shall always be available on or in connection with such Third-Party Technology.</p> <p><b>4.4 Third Party Notices.</b> The Software may include third party code that Skype, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only. Third party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the Software, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Skype.</p> <h2><a name="5"></a><b>5. USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AND SKYPE WEBSITES</b></h2> <p><b>5.1 Equipment:</b> In order to use the Software and the Products you will need an Internet broadband connection. You are responsible for providing all equipment required to access the Internet or enable communications such as headsets, microphones and webcams.</p> <p><b>5.2 Use of Your Equipment:</b> The Internet Communications Software may use the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the communication and establishing the connection between Internet Communications Software users. If your use of the Internet Communications Software is dependent upon the use of a processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a third party, you acknowledge and agree that your licence to use the Internet Communications Software is subject to you obtaining consent from the relevant third party for such use. You represent and warrant that by accepting these Terms, you have obtained such consent.</p> <p><b>5.3 Updates to the Software:</b> Skype may automatically check your version of the Skype Software. You may be required to enter into an updated version of these Terms to be able to download or otherwise take advantage of any Updates. Skype has no obligation to make available any Updates. However, Skype may (a) require you to download and install Updates; or (b) download and install Updates from Skype automatically from time to time unless you have chosen (through your Skype client settings) not to receive automatic Updates. Microsoft Corporation or its affiliates and subsidiaries may also automatically download updates to the Skype Software for Windows, if you have chosen to receive Microsoft Updates. These updates are required to maintain software compatibility, provide security updates or bug fixes, or offer new features, functionality or versions. You agree to receive such updates from Skype in order to continue using the Skype Software and you agree to accept such Updates subject to these Terms.</p> <p><b>5.4 Suspension, technical improvement and maintenance:</b> From time to time, Skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the Software, Products or Skype Websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the Software, Products or Skype Websites. This may require Skype to temporarily suspend or limit your use of some or all of the Software, Products or Skype Websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed. To the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, Skype will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the Skype Website in advance. You will not be entitled to claim damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of any Software, Product or Skype Website.</p> <p><b>5.5 No Access to Emergency Services:</b> Neither the Products nor the Software are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (&ldquo;Emergency Services&rdquo;). There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Products. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skype is not required to offer access to Emergency Services under any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law; (ii) it is your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Products, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (iii) the Software and the Products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at www.skype.com/go/emergency.</p> <p><b>5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only and Not Applicable to the Qik Software)</b></p> <p><b>5.6.1 </b>In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect. Click here for the listing of countries (&ldquo;Enabled Countries&rdquo;) and software versions and other platforms (&ldquo;Enabled Versions&rdquo;) that enable limited Skype emergency calling. Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms. You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype&rsquo;s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort. In particular, please also note that:</p> <p>(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services. Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection.</p> <p>(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.</p> <p>(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you. If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software. Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.</p> <p>(iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using Skype&rsquo;s APIs, any of Skype&rsquo;s software development kits or otherwise).</p> <p><b>5.6.2</b> In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)). It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world. Where limited emergency calling is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance. If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software. If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.</p> <p><b>5.7</b> Content of Communications: Skype is not the source of, does not verify or endorse and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made using the Software.

Skype reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to review content for the purpose of enforcing these Terms. Skype may in its sole discretion block, prevent delivery of or otherwise remove the content of communications as part of its effort to protect the Software, Products or its customers, or otherwise enforce these Terms.

CHARGES</b></h2> <p><b>8.1 Calling phones and premium rate numbers with Skype Credit:</b></p> <p>(i) <b>Calling landlines and mobiles:</b> The charges payable for calling phones (outside of a subscription) consist of a connection fee (charged once, per call) and a per-minute rate as set out on www.skype.com/go/allrates. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration and an additional connection fee will be charged on re-dial.</p> <p>(ii) <b>Premium rate numbers:</b> The charges payable for calling premium rate numbers consist of a per-minute rate available at www.skype.com/go/rates-premium. No connection fee is payable.</p> <p>(iii) Skype may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers at any time without notice to you by posting such change at www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next purchase after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.</p> <p>(iv) The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. The connection fee, where applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent, for example a total call price of &euro;0.034 will be rounded up to &euro;0.04. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Skype Credit balance in your User Account.</p> <p><b>8.2 Charges for other Paid For Products:</b> The charges for other Paid For Products will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from Skype. Skype may change the charges payable for the purchase of such Products at any time without any notice to you. You can choose whether or not to accept the new charges prior to completing your next purchase of the applicable Product. The new charges will apply to your next purchase after the new charges have been published.</p> <p><b>8.3 Promotional Offers:</b> From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period. Skype reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Skype determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.</p> <p><b>8.4 Tax:</b> Skype may collect VAT or other indirect taxes at the appropriate rate (as per applicable tax rules) at the time of purchase of Skype Credit. 15% Luxembourg VAT generally applies if you are located in the EU and the Products are purchased and used in the EU. 8% Swiss VAT applies if you are located in Switzerland. Other local taxes may apply in certain countries. When you purchase a voucher or pre-paid card, depending on the country, 15% Luxembourg VAT, local VAT or other taxes may apply and may be deducted from the value of the voucher or prepaid card upon redemption. You explicitly waive any right to VAT reimbursement from Skype if the amount of VAT ultimately payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower than the amount of VAT collected from you at the time of purchase. Your Skype Credit balance is displayed exclusive of any such taxes. The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended. The Skype Website does not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this VAT exemption and we therefore do not provide the Products in such territories: Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Büsingen / Buesingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Livigno, Campione d&#39;Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano.</p> <p><b>8.5 Third-Party Charges:</b> Using the Software on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.</p> <h2><a name="9"></a><b>9. PAYMENT</b></h2> <p><b>9.1 Skype Credit.</b> You can pay for select Paid-For Products using Skype Credit. You can purchase Skype Credit using any payment method made available to you by Skype from time to time. The Skype Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Skype Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher).</p> <p><b>9.2 Inactive Skype Credit.</b> If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Skype Credit that has been allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator) Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate. Reactivated Skype Credit is not refundable. If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to use any Skype Credit on or after the date of its expiry.</p> <p><b>9.3 Other payment methods.</b> Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you. Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.</p> <p><b>9.4 Recurring Payments.</b> Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.</p> <p><b>9.5 Auto-Recharge.</b></p> <p>(a) The Auto-Recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Skype Credit, unless you untick the appropriate box. Your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account. For example, if you purchase 10 Euros of Skype Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be 10 Euros of Skype Credit. In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box.</p> <p>(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription.</p> <p>(c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account.</p> <h2><a name="10"></a><b>10. REFUND POLICY</b></h2> <p><b>10.1</b> When you purchase Paid-For-Products directly from Skype you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a <b>&ldquo;Cooling-Off Period&rdquo;</b>) unless you have made use of the Paid-For-Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded.</p> <p><b>10.2</b> Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired.</p> <p><b>10.3</b> Expenditure of Skype Credit, allocation of a Skype Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to &ldquo;use&rdquo; of a Paid-For-Product. You hereby expressly agree that Skype Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period.</p> <p><b>10.4</b> The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Paid-For-Products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner of Skype (please contact the partner directly, who may decide in its sole discretion whether or not to pay a refund), (ii) not directly acquired online from Skype (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) (iii) paid for in cash using third party payment methods (such as a cash payment wallet) and (iv) paid for and allocated to your Skype Account by a Skype Manager administrator.

No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.</p> <p><b>10.6</b> Skype reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these Terms or (iii) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently.</p> <p><b>10.7</b> This refund policy does not affect your statutory rights.</p> <h2><a name="11"></a><b>11.

PAY BY MOBILE</b></h2> <p><b>20.1</b> This section applies if you select a third-party payment system that enables you to pay for Skype Credit and certain Paid for Products via your mobile phone bill where applicable (<b>&ldquo;Pay by Mobile&rdquo;</b>).</p> <p><b>20.2</b> By selecting or using Pay by Mobile:</p> <p>(a) You authorise your mobile phone carrier to charge appropriate fees directly to your mobile phone bill; and</p> <p>(b) You represent that you are the person or entity responsible for the mobile phone account associated with the mobile number you provide when using Pay by Mobile, or are authorised by that person or entity to incur such charges.</p> <p><b>20.3 BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR UNITED STATES ACCOUNTS.</b> If you select Pay by Mobile and your mobile phone account is registered with a mobile phone carrier in the USA or you reside in the USA, the following additional terms apply:</p> <p>(a) Paragraph 20.3 applies to any dispute arising between you and either Skype or any third party including mobile phone carriers and Skype&rsquo;s corporate affiliates (collectively, <b>&ldquo;Disputed Party&rdquo;</b> or <b>&ldquo;Disputed Parties&rdquo;</b>) relating to your use of Pay by Mobile, EXCEPT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, SKYPE&rsquo;S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS&rsquo; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. <b>Dispute</b>, for purposes of paragraph 20.3, means any dispute, action, or other controversy whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. Dispute will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.</p> <p>(b) In the event of a dispute, you must provide Skype or other Disputed Party with a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute to Skype or its corporate affiliate at ATTN: Legal Department, Microsoft Corporation One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052-7329. and to any other Disputed Party at its principal place of business in the USA, marked ATTN: Legal Department. The Disputed Party will send any Notice of Dispute to your address if it has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address on file. You and the Disputed Party will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent, after which you or the Disputed Party may commence arbitration.</p> <p>(c) You may also litigate any dispute in a small claims court in your county of residence, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in a small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p> <p>(d) <b>Binding Arbitration.</b> If you and a Disputed Party do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;). You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator&rsquo;s award.</p> <p>(e) <b>Class Action Waiver.</b> Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor a Disputed Party will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p> <p>(f) Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If you are an individual and use the Software or Products for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 USD or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use them, its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will also apply. For more information, see adr.org or call +1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $75,000 USD or less, Skype will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA&rsquo;s and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees. You and Skype agree to the terms governing procedures, fees and incentives at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=275219.&nbsp; To commence arbitration, submit the form available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=275627 to the AAA. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence, in Santa Clara County, California, or another Disputed Party&rsquo;s principal place of business in the USA.&nbsp;Skype and other Disputed Parties agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.</p> <p>(g) To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to your use of Pay by Mobile must be filed within one year in small claims court (paragraph 20.3(c)) or in arbitration (paragraph 20.3(d)). The one-year period begins when the claim or dispute first could be filed. If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</p> <p>(h) <b>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</b> You may reject any change Skype makes to paragraph 20.3 (other than address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in paragraph 20.3(b). If you do, the most recent version of paragraph 20.3 before the change you rejected will apply.</p> <p>(i) If the class action waiver in paragraph 20.3(e) is found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then paragraph 20.3 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of paragraph 20.3 is found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of paragraph 20.3 remaining in full force and effect.</p> <p><b>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS AND UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN.
