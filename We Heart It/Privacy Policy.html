<p id="section-1"><strong>I. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect and Sources of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>As you use the Services, we may collect or you may provide information that identifies, relates to, or directly or indirectly describes you or your household and devices (<strong>&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;</strong>). Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information. For example, when you contact our customer support services, this may include a record of communication correspondence and associated contact information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Categories of Personal Information That You Provide or Authorize Us to Collect</em></strong></p>
<p>We collect the following categories of Personal Information you provide when you use the Services:</p>
<p><em>Social Networking Details</em>. Where applicable, you may sign up to use the Services directly via the Services or via certain third-party social networking sites (each, a <strong>&ldquo;Social Networking Site&rdquo;</strong>). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the Personal Information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your &ldquo;real&rdquo; name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that information to connect to our Services; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site.</p>
<p><em>Purchase Details</em>. If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you, including financial information related to your method of payment, to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods.</p>
<p><em>Other Information You Provide When You Use the Services</em>. We collect information that you provide in connection with your registration, such as profile details and other personal identifiers, as well as general location information you may choose to provide. We also collect information related to your use of the Services, including things you upload to the Services, records of your interaction with the Services, such as tagging a photo, Hearting content, or editing a collection, as well as individual preferences and certain online identifiers and other internet or electronic network activity information about your computer or mobile device, such as operating system, software version and unique advertising identifier.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Device Information, Collected with Your Consent</em>. With your permission and depending on the requirements of the specific Services you are using, we may access additional information from your device, such as contacts access (to enable inviting and finding friends) or photo library access (to allow for profile picture and image uploads). You must grant the app or service permission to enable these features.</p>
<p>Certain information we collect may be Personal Information depending on how it is combined with other identifiers (for example, your IP address when combined with other data that enables us to identify you or your household). The same pieces of information may not be Personal Information when taken alone or combined only with non-identifying information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Services may require additional information or permissions from your device in order to provide certain functions, including monitoring and analyzing use of the Services, maintaining and improving the Services, and serving advertisements and other information that may interest you.</p>
<p><em>Log Data</em>. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a <strong>&ldquo;We Heart It User&rdquo;</strong>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or application (<strong>&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;</strong>). This Log Data may include information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (<strong>&ldquo;IP&rdquo;</strong>) address</li>
<li>the browser type or the website or application you were visiting before you came to the Services</li>
<li>pages of the websites or applications involved in the Service that you visit and the time spent on those pages</li>
<li>information you search for</li>
<li>other details about your interaction with our Services, such as access times and dates, your device&rsquo;s operating system, software version, unique advertising identifier, and other identifiers and statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Service&rsquo;s technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors&rsquo; needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and remember your preferences. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data, and such aggregate data is not treated as Personal Information.</p>
<p><em>Information Collected from Cookies and Similar Technology</em>. Like many websites and applications, our Service uses &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; and mobile advertising identifiers to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device for record-keeping purposes. An advertising identifier is an anonymous, resettable ID associated with your mobile device that can be managed in your device settings.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></p>

Any third party to which We Heart It transfers or sells We Heart It&rsquo;s assets will have the right to continue to use the Personal Information and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.</li>

</ul>

<p id="section-2"><strong>II. Legal Bases for Use of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Other than as described above, the legal bases for using your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) our use of your Personal Information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the Terms of Service); or</p>
<p>(b) you have provided us with your consent to do so, including with respect to the advertising and marketing materials delivered via our Services that are tailored to you and your preferences.</p>
<p>(c) where (a) or (b) does not apply, our use of your Personal Information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Our legitimate interests are to:</p>
<p>(i) develop and improve our business, including funding our business by use of advertising revenues;</p>
<p>(ii) operate, maintain and improve the Services and our marketing optimization efforts;</p>
<p>(iii) understand the way in which the Services are used; and</p>
<p>(iv) for internal administrative purposes.</p>

<p id="section-3"><strong>III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>We Heart It&nbsp;Registered Users</em>. </strong></p>
<p>If you register through the Services and submit your Personal Information to create a profile or login credentials for We Heart It, other registered users may be able to see your Username and other Personal Information you choose to include in your profile or otherwise post or share.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third-Party Advertisers.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Aggregate Information, Identifiers, Personal Information, and Other Data Shared with Advertisers</em>. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information with third parties. We may also disclose device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and Log Data with third parties. This information is used for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes</p>
<p>For example, we may share the advertising identifier associated with your device (such as the Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device; in some instances, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do not associate any of your Personal Information with your advertising device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms of use for an Application).</p>
<p>In addition to device and advertising identifiers, we may share Log Data and aggregated information with third-party advertising and technology companies. The data we share with them may include data about your device, location, and use of We Heart It, including IP address, usage data and technical information, purchase data, and information you provide to us when using We Heart It. Such information may be used to send you personalized advertisements for products and services that are relevant to your interests.</p>
<p><em>Personalized Advertising on the Services and on Other Online Services. </em>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, such as aggregating your data with other data they hold in order to inform advertising related services provided to other clients. These third parties may place a cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our Services so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests.&nbsp;That advertising may appear across the Services, or on other websites, apps and services.</p>
<p><em>Opting Out of Personalized Ads on Browsers and on Certain Devices. </em>You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not&nbsp;be able to use all portions or all functionality of our Services, and advertising will no longer be targeted to your interests.</p>
<p>On mobile you can reset your settings by referring to your devices settings and instructions or by taking the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>For iOS:&nbsp;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074</li>

<p id="section-6"><strong>VI. Security</strong></p>

<p>We Heart It is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access.&nbsp;No security, however, can eliminate the possibility that your information may be accessed by an unauthorized third party, and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure in all situations.</p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We reserve the right to choose which method we use to contact you about such an event.</p>

<p id="section-7"><strong>VII. International Transfer</strong></p>

<p>You are giving us the following particular express, voluntary, and informed consent to a few activities relating to your Personal Information that is disclosed in providing goods and services to you, or for a purpose directly related to such purpose:</p>
<p><strong><em>Consent to International Transfer and Disclosure of Personal Information</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>We Heart It is located in the United States (&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;) and is subject to the applicable laws of the United States (where data privacy laws are less stringent than in the European Union and certain other jurisdictions). We will store and process information we receive about you, as described in this Privacy Policy, in the U.S.</p>
<p>We may be involved in business activities in a variety of countries. You agree that We Heart It and those with whom we share your Personal Information (&ldquo;Recipients&rdquo;) may disclose, transfer, process, and store your Personal Information outside of your country of origin to our affiliates, sponsors and partners, and any other third party service providers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Some of the recipients of Personal Information as specified above may be located in countries that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to that set forth by the European Union and some other jurisdictions.If you submit any Personal Information or choose to access or use the Services offered by We Heart It, you consent to such disclosure, transfer, processing, and storage of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to such applicable laws which may include access by law enforcement and other government entities including courts and tribunals.</p>
<p>If we do transfer Personal Information outside the U.S., we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it were being used in the U.S. We will use one of the following safeguards to ensure your information is protected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer the data to a non-EEA country that has privacy laws at least as protective as those within the EEA, or</li>
<li>Put in place a contract with the recipient of the data, which means the recipient must protect the data to the same standards as required within the EEA, or</li>
<li>Transfer it to organizations that are part of the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is a framework that sets out the standards for data to be sent between the United States and European countries. The Privacy Shield ensures that data are protected to the same standards as used within the EEA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Consent to Electronic Notice If There is a Security Breach.</em></strong></p>
<p>We will safeguard your Personal Information and prevent such information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. If we or a Recipient are required to provide notice of unauthorized access to or other invasion of certain security systems, you agree that we (or they) may do so when required (or voluntarily) by posting notice on our website or sending notice to any email address we have for you, in our (or their) good faith discretion. You agree that notice to you will count as notice to others for whom you are acting, and agree to pass the notice on to them.</p>

<p id="section-8"><strong>VIII. Our Policy Toward Children</strong></p>

<p>The We Heart It Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, he or she should contact us at&nbsp;<strong>legal@weheartit.com</strong>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information.</p>

<p id="section-9"><strong>IX. Phishing</strong></p>

<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are of great concern to We Heart It. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p id="section-10"><strong>X. Links to Other Sites</strong></p>

<p>Our Services may provide links to other websites and applications. If you choose to visit an advertiser by &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo; a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party&rsquo;s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them.
