All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Service.

In such case, you agree to reimburse We Heart It for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, We Heart It shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. <strong>You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and We Heart It are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and We Heart It agree that YOU AND We Heart It MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.</p>
<p><em>Formal Resolution. </em>If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, you and We Heart It each agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the Southern District of the State of New York, provided that neither you nor We Heart It shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court, regardless of whether such small claims court is located in New York, for disputes within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.</p>
