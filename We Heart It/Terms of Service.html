            Service, the provisions of this Part B of the Terms of Service shall take precedence.</p>
          <p id="part-b-1"><strong>I. Subscription Services and Purchase Services</strong></p>
          <p>We Heart It may offer certain Services subject to a fee. These fees can be one-time fees to be paid prior
            to purchase (<strong>&ldquo;Purchase Services&rdquo;</strong>) or recurring fees
            (<strong>&ldquo;Subscription Services&rdquo;</strong>).</p>

            the amount of fees due as well as free trial periods, if applicable, will be described in the respective
            Service descriptions.</p>
          <p><em>Platform Terms Apply to Purchases and Subscriptions</em>. If you buy Purchase Services or Subscription
            Services, the relevant distribution and / or payment platform terms will also apply (e.g., the terms for the
            Apple App Store, Google Play Store, wherever else you purchased the Services). You acknowledge that any
            billing and transactions are handled by that platform provider. You should contact the platform provider
            directly if you have any payment related issues with Purchase or Subscription Services.</p>
          <p><em>Third Party Purchase or Subscription Services</em>. Purchase or Subscription Services may be offered by
            third parties not affiliated with We Heart It, and you may be asked to agree to relevant service terms that

            value of any Virtual Item does not correspond or equate to any real-life monetary value, credit balance, or
            currency. You acknowledge that virtual Items cannot be used outside of the respective Service and do not
            comprise any stored value. Your right to use Virtual Items is personal to you unless we agree otherwise and

            respective Service description, we will convert the Trial Version to a Purchase Service or Subscription
            Service subject to a fee. This automatic conversion does not apply where, in case of a Subscription Service,
            you have deactivated the automatic renewal in your iTunes account settings, Google Play account settings, or
            other platform settings at least 24 hours before the end of the trial period or before the applicable

            delete the Service or terminate any premium features of the Purchase Service. In addition to any rights
            granted to you under Part A of these Terms of Service, the use rights granted by We Heart It are bound to
            the respective Service that you have purchased and any updates or new releases of the Purchase Service for

            discretion.</p>
          <p><em>Term for a Subscription Service.</em> The term for a Subscription Service begins with the placement of
            the order (e.g., by clicking &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;purchase,&rdquo; and/or using additional
            confirmation methods as available) and continues for the initial term (weekly, monthly, or yearly) as
            provided in the description of the purchased Subscription Service. The subscription will automatically renew
            for the same period as the Initial Term (<strong>&ldquo;Renewal Term&rdquo;</strong>) and in accordance with
            the then-current fees as described in the Subscription Service description, unless you have deactivated the
            automatic renewal in your iTunes account settings, Google Play account settings, or other subscription
            platform settings, or used any other termination mechanism on the subscription platform or as permitted by
            applicable law, at least 24 hours before the end of the then-current subscription term
            (<strong>&ldquo;Termination Period&rdquo;</strong>). If you have terminated the subscription before the
            Termination Period, then you will not be able to access and use the Subscription Services, including paid
            subscriptions to special features, once the Initial Term or the respective Renewal Term has expired. Any
            statutory right to terminate the agreement shall not be affected. We shall be entitled to terminate your
            Subscription Service effective as of the end of each Initial or Renewal Term by providing fourteen (14) days
            prior notice. To terminate a subscription, you may cancel your subscriptions in your iTunes account
            settings, Google Play account settings, or other subscription platform settings, or use and other
            termination mechanism made available on the subscription platform or as permitted by applicable law.</p>
          <p><em>Term of a Trial Version.</em> The term for a Trial Version begins with the placement of the order
            (e.g., by clicking &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;purchase,&rdquo; and/or using additional confirmation methods
            as available) and ends after the term announced in the Services description (<strong>&ldquo;Trial
              Period&rdquo;</strong>). The term of a Trial Version ends automatically after the Trial Period has ended.
            Once your Trial Period ends, you will no longer be able to access the Trial Version of the Services. We
            reserve the right to:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:2em;">(i) determine if you are eligible to use the Trial Version and</p>

            (including litigation or other legal proceeding). Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding
            for at least thirty (30) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing
            (<strong>&ldquo;Notice of Claim&rdquo;</strong>). If We Heart It has a Claim against you, we will send our

          <p><em>Arbitration. </em><strong>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</strong> We Heart It and

            arbitrate all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service between We Heart It
            and you. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American
            Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and shall be administered by the
            AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the
            arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein, We Heart It will pay
            all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set
            forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the
            AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse We Heart It for all monies previously disbursed by it that
            are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is
            equal to or greater than the value of your demand, We Heart It shall reimburse you for your reasonable
            attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. <strong>You agree that, by entering into
              these Terms of Service, you and We Heart It are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and We Heart It
              agree that YOU AND We Heart It MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
              and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</strong>
            Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and
            may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific
            proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.
