eLearners.
com believes that all the information that we gather about you should be used solely to assist you in locating, comparing, purchasing, registering or inquiring about courses, degrees, professional training or related services.
Although other companies may seek to purchase information regarding our users, eLearners.

Information Collection and Use This document discloses eLearners.
com's information gathering and dissemination practices as they apply to individual site users on www.
elearners.
com.
eLearners.
com collects information from its users at several different points on its website.
Registration In order to request information from many of our educational partners, a user must first complete a form with contact information.
These forms vary across partners but can include name, email address, mailing address, day and night phone number, education level, and income range.
eLearners.
com and our partners use this information to contact users about services, courses, or training for which they have requested information or expressed interest.
We do not sell or make available this information for any other reason.
In rare cases, the receiving partner may already have the users information on file.
When this occurs, the users information may be sent to a similar education provider that has the degree program, the course or the training that suits the users needs.
Users may also choose to make the information provided to our educational partners available to other third parties.
Please refer to the partner's privacy statement in these instances.
Cookies A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
Cookie data may be linked to personally identifiable information for data analysis and quality assurance purposes, but individual cookie data is never shared with or sold to any third parties.
We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies with a life up to 60 days.
For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time.
eLearners.
com uses cookies to track which areas of our site are most visited for the purpose of better optimization and user experience.
If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
See the "Profile" section.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by eLearners.
com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
We use clear gifs in our email communications.
We use clear gifs within our email communications so that we may monitor how many emails have been opened.
Profile We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.
A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.
This information is not tied to the users personally identifiable information.
We do not share your profile with other third parties.
Log Files Like most standard website servers we use log files.
This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc.
are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) We and our third party advertising companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.
k.
a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company.
That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.
companyX.
com," which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the website or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer.
This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or website.
