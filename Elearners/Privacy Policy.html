citizen, address, phone number, e-mail address, military affiliation, educational background, and years of work experience), such information may also be used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from EducationDynamics, our affiliated properties and services, and institutions of higher education about opportunities, programs and other services that are related to education.
