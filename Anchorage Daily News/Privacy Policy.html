You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with some of the services provided by partners and other third-party providers on ADN.
com.
Be aware that the information collected by a third-party provider will be subject to that provider's privacy policy and terms of service, rather than this Privacy Policy.
We, therefore, recommend you review the privacy policy of each third-party service provider with whom you interact and each Web site you visit prior to submitting information in connection therewith.
If you wish to forward an article to a friend, we will ask that you provide your friend's name and e-mail address.
While we may collect statistics on which articles are forwarded, we do not sell, rent, or market your friend's personal information, and retain the information only as long as necessary to provide this service.
Passive data collection and use Like most Web sites, ADN.
com also collects and logs information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such as your IP address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of time that you stay on ADN.
com, search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred you to ADN.
com and the average number of pages viewed.
If you visit another Web site prior to browsing ADN.
com, that Web site might place personally identifiable information within a URL, which may be logged by us.
Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet.
Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet.
Note that logging your IP address does not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home or work address.
We use this log information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and may also use it to gather general demographic information about you such as your general location and your Internet Service Provider.
To better provide our services to you and to develop member profiles that enable us to tailor ADN.
com's services and its advertisements to your interests, we may correlate this log information with other information about you, such as your registration information or newspaper subscription records.
We may provide to third parties anonymous aggregated (non-personally identifiable) general information about our Web site and its users.
Use of cookies Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer.
Our use of cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is used to recognize you and hold information from one visit to the next in an effort to increase your ease of use of ADN.
com and to allow us to better understand how people use ADN.
com through click-stream analysis.
For example, cookies may be used to store information such as your member name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.
Another example is that we may use cookie technology to control the number of times you see a particular advertisement while visiting ADN.
