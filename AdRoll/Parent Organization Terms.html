        <li><u>Suspension or Termination.</u> NextRoll may suspend or terminate Customer and its Authorized Users’ access to the Services, in whole or in part, without notice, for non-payment of Fees.

If an Agency or Authorized Reseller (but not its Client) enters into or is the subject of an insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceeding or any other proceeding for the settlement of Customer’s debts, NextRoll shall have the right to notify relevant Clients directly in effort to settle outstanding liabilities under this Agreement.</li>

            <li>The Consent Mechanism must state the purpose of any data collection and meet the technical and policy compliance checks for the most current and functioning Transparency and Consent Framework (<b>"TCF"</b>) of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (<b>"IAB"</b>), as demonstrated by passing the IAB Europe’s CMP Validator (a tool to check compliance with the TCF).

Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was lawfully known to the Receiving Party prior to receiving the same from the Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement; (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (c) is lawfully acquired by the Receiving Party from another source without restriction as to use; or (d) is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party.

      <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION FOR RESIDENTS OF THE U.S.</p>

      <p><b>13.1 Please contact NextRoll first!</b> NextRoll wants to address Customer's concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings. Before filing a claim, Customer agrees to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting NextRoll first through support@nextroll.com, or via Customer’s designated Account Manager.</p>

      <p><b>13.2 Venue for disputes.</b> Customer and NextRoll agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Customer and NextRoll consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. Notwithstanding the above, Customer and NextRoll agree that Customer alternatively may attend any arbitration proceedings telephonically or videographically, in which case NextRoll will do so as well.</p>

      <p>U.S. RESIDENTS ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</p>

      <p><b>13.3 Arbitration.</b></p>

      <ul class="list-lower-alpha">
        <li><b>Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> Customer and NextRoll agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</li>
        <li><b>Arbitration Procedures.</b> The American Arbitration Association (<b>"AAA"</b>) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States in accordance with the venue specified in Section 13.2.</li>
        <li><b>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</b> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. NextRoll will pay all arbitration fees for Customer on a pre-pay plan where Customer’s claim is for less than $50,000. NextRoll will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that Customer's claim is frivolous.</li>
        <li><b>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> Either party may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, provided that NextRoll agrees that Customer may choose to appear by video, and if Customer so chooses, then NextRoll shall appear by video as well. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If this Agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to Customer or Customer's claim, Customer agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California to resolve Customer's claim.</li>
        <li><b>Opt Out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> Customer can decline this agreement to arbitrate by sending an email within thirty (30) days of entering into this Agreement to: <a href="mailto:arbitration_optout@nextroll.com">arbitration_optout@nextroll.com</a> clearly stating that Customer wishes to opt out of arbitration with NextRoll and include Customer's name, and the name and email address associated with the Account.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>13.4 Class Action Waiver.</b> Both parties agree to resolve any disputes, claims, or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the NextRoll Materials, or the Services provided by NextRoll, will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p>

      <p><b>13.5 Controlling Law.</b> This Agreement is governed by the law of the State of California except for its conflicts of laws principles.</p>

      <p><b>14.7 Severability.</b> If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability will not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable portion will be given effect to the greatest extent possible.</p>

      <p><b>14.8 Waiver.</b> The failure of a party to require performance of any provision will not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>

      <p><b>14.9 Third-Party Website Disclaimer.</b> Links to third-party websites from the Services do not imply endorsement by NextRoll of any products, services or information presented therein, nor does NextRoll warrant or otherwise guarantee the accuracy of the information contained on them.</p>
