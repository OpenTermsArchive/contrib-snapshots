			<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Myspace LLC ("<strong>Myspace</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>" or
				"<strong>us</strong>") operates Myspace®, a place where people come to connect, discover, and share.
				Showcasing artists and their work, Myspace gives people access to a massive digital music library. With
				roots in music and social, the platform is built to empower all artists—from musicians and designers to
				writers and photographers—helping them connect with audiences, collaborators, and partners to achieve
				their goals. Through an open design, compelling editorial features, and analytics-based recommendations,
				Myspace fosters a creative community of people who connect around mutual affinity and inspiration for
				the purpose of shaping, sharing, and discovering what’s next.</p>

			<p>The services offered by Myspace include (i) those offered on any Myspace-branded URL, including <a
						href="https://www.myspace.com" target="_blank">www.myspace.com</a> (the "<strong>Myspace
					Website</strong>"), (ii) Myspace music and video services, (iii) Myspace developer services, (iv)
				Myspace mobile services, (v) Myspace advertising services, and (vi) any other features, content, or
				applications offered or operated from time to time by Myspace in connection with Myspace’s business,
				including when Myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other device
				(collectively, "<strong>Myspace Services</strong>"). The Myspace Services are hosted in the United
				States, and if you reside outside of the United States by using the Services you consent to the transfer
				of your personal data to the United States and elsewhere for all purposes identified in our Privacy
				Notice and/or Policy. <strong>If you do not agree to this international transfer of data, then you must
					refrain from using the Myspace Services.</strong> For more information, please see our <a
						href="/pages/eeaprivacy" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a> and <a
						href="/pages/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. The Myspace
				Services are operated by Myspace, a company with a mailing address of 6100 Center Dr., Suite 800, Los
				Angeles 90045, which is owned by the digital media company Viant Technology LLC (“VIANT”). (“<strong>VIANT</strong>”).
			</p>

			<p>This Agreement constitutes legally binding terms and applies to such use of the Myspace Services
				regardless of the type of device used to access them (“<strong>Device</strong>”) unless such services
				post a different terms of use or end user license agreement, in which case that agreement (“<strong>Other
					Terms</strong>”) shall instead govern. By accessing and/or using any of the Myspace Services, you
				agree to be bound by this Agreement (or if applicable, the Other Terms), whether you are a “Visitor”
				(which means that you simply browse the Myspace Services, including, without limitation, through a
				mobile or other wireless Device, or otherwise use the Myspace Services without being registered) or you
				are a “<strong>Member</strong>” (which means that you have registered with Myspace). The term “<strong>User</strong>”
				refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are authorized to use the Myspace Services (regardless of whether
				your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations
				(“<strong>Applicable Law</strong>”) and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for
				becoming a Member and/or making use of the Myspace Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this
				Agreement during the registration process. Thereafter, you may create your account (your “<strong>Account</strong>”),
				and its associated profile(s) (each a “<strong>Profile</strong>”) in accordance with the terms herein.
			</p>

			<p>In some instances, both this Agreement and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale
				setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Myspace
				Services or to a service or product offered via the Myspace Services (in each such instance, and
				collectively, “<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”). To the extent there is a conflict between this
				Agreement and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms
				expressly state otherwise. Please also review the terms of the Myspace Services’ <a
						href="/pages/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, <a
						href="/pages/eeaprivacy" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>, <a
						href="/pages/videoprivacy" target="_blank">Video Privacy Policy</a>, and <a
						href="pages/cookiepolicy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>, which you accept by
				using the Myspace Services.</p>

Myspace reserves the right to remove commercial content in its sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the commercial use restrictions, the unauthorized collection of usernames, user id numbers or similar designation, and/or email addresses of Members by electronic or other means, or employing third party promotional sites or software to promote Profiles for money, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, endorsements, affiliate links, and other forms of unauthorized data collection or solicitation may be removed from Profiles without notice or explanation and may result in termination of Membership privileges.</span>

				<!-- 9. -->
				<li>
					<span>Profiles and Profile Settings</span>
					<p><span>Myspace may allow you to create multiple Profiles associated with your Account on certain
						aspects of, or all of the Myspace Services. Examples of such Profiles are “Real Name Profiles”,
						“Alias Profiles”, “Parody Profiles”, “Role Playing Profiles”, “Fan Profiles”, “Artist Profiles”,
						or other Profiles that Myspace may authorize from time to time. We may offer you, from time to
						time, the ability to choose how you share or make your Profile, or aspects of it, available to
						others by means of “<strong>Profile Settings</strong>”, which functionality may change as the
						Myspace Services evolve. Myspace currently makes all Profiles of Members aged 18 and older
						public by default. Profiles of Members whose ages are 13 to 17 are currently “restricted” by
						default, as further detailed in the <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy
							Policy</a>. You may adjust the public or restricted status of your Profile in your Profile
						Settings. We will make good faith efforts to honor Profile Settings, but are not responsible for
						errors and reserve the right to change the way Settings and preferences work from time to time,
						so visit your Profile Settings regularly to ensure that the reflect your preferences and to see
						how we may have added or changed how you can exercise choice. For more information on how to use
						Profile Settings, and how they are intended to work, click <a
									href="/settings/profile" target="_blank">here</a>. You may not use any
						Profile for purpose of impersonation, deception or confusion.</span></p>

					<ol type="a">
						<!-- 9.1. -->
						<li><strong>Real Name Profiles</strong>. You may create a Profile in which your activities on
							the Myspace Services are associated with your real name (each, a “<strong>Real Name
								Profile</strong>”), and you agree and acknowledge that any risk associated with such
							Real Name Profiles are borne solely by you.
						</li>
						<!-- 9.2. -->
						<li><strong>Alias Profiles</strong>. An Alias Profile allows you to create an alternate
							public-facing profile as an alternative to a Real Name Profile, which publicly displays your
							real name in association with your Profile and activities on the Myspace Services. For
							example, you might decide that in an Alias Profile, your username or full name for that
							Profile is a nickname or other made up name.
						</li>
						<!-- 9.3. -->
						<li><strong>Parody, Role Playing and Fan Profiles</strong>. Myspace may allow you to create
							profiles for the purpose of parody, role playing, or being a fan (collectively, Parody, Role
							Playing and Fan Profiles are known as “<strong>Non-Standard Profiles</strong>”). You are
							allowed to create Non-Standard Profiles, but you must indicate in the Non-Standard Profile
							that Non-Standard Profile will be used for the Non-Standard Profile purposes, by including a
							statement of this fact in the about section of your Profile (e.g., “This is a parody
							Profile.”, or similar language). You must also ensure that the full name that you choose for
							the Non-Standard Profile includes some indication that the Non-Standard Profile is being
							used in a parody, role-playing, fan or other manner than as a true and veritable Account of
							an actual living person. For example, if you want to create a Non-Standard Profile for the
							purpose of (i) role playing, you should add “-roleplay” to the end of the desired full name;
							(ii) fanning, you should add “-fan” to the end of the desired full name; (iii) parody or
							farce, you should add “-fake”, “-parody”, or “-joke” to the end of the desired full name.
							You must not use a Non-Standard Profile for purposes of impersonation, deception or
							confusion.
						</li>
						<!-- 9.4. -->
						<li><strong>Artist Profiles</strong>. Myspace may allow you to create a Profile specifically
							designed for artists (each an “<strong>Artist Profile</strong>”), for example, musicians,
							comedians, or other artists. Myspace may provide Artist Profiles with features and
							functionality not available to other Profile types, and you must not use an Artist Profile
							if you are not legitimately an artist.
						</li>
						<!-- 9.5. -->
						<li><strong>Suspension or Termination</strong>. Myspace may suspend or terminate Profiles,
							and/or the Membership of Accounts associated with them, in the event they do not comply with
							this Agreement, or for any other or no reason. Individuals and artists that are Members may
							set up profiles, subject to certain rules. From time to time we may offer certain
							functionality to allow you to express privacy, communication and other preferences, which we
							will make a good faith effort to honor.

In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but, if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Myspace to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 17 to be enforceable, then Myspace will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</span>

									<p><span><strong>No Class Action Matters</strong>. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, with the exception of representative claims solely for injunctive relief brought under California unfair competition law. If any provision of this arbitration provision is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision shall be severable from the remainder of this paragraph, which shall remain fully enforceable. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM FOR ALLEGED DAMAGES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</span>
