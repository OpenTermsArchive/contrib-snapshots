What This Privacy Notice Covers <p>This notice covers how Weebly, Inc., a U.S.
company ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives from its website (www.weebly.com), website hosting and design services, communication tools, mobile applications, app marketplace, ecommerce tools, and other services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
<p>We are not in the business of selling personal information about you.
We use information shared with us for the purpose of running and improving our Service and in that capacity will operate as a data controller and, to the extent we process data, a data processor.</p>
<p>This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.</p>
<p>For some parts of the Weebly Service, such as our eCommerce platform, our user is the data controller and Weebly is a data processor.  As a data processor, Weebly does not have a direct relationship with the person whose personal information we collect and process at the direction of our user.  If you are a customer of one of these users and no longer want to be contacted by that user, please contact the user you interacted with directly.</p>
<p>Weebly acknowledges you have the right to access and change the personal information we collect and process as a data processor.  An individual who seeks to access or to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal information should direct their request to the Weebly user who is the data controller, and not to Weebly directly.
If the data controller requests Weebly remove personal information we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Personal information we process on behalf of our users will be retained for as long as needed to provide services to our users.
Weebly will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We may transfer this personal information to companies that help us provide our service.
Transfer of your data to third party service providers is governed by the terms of service between Weebly and its users.
