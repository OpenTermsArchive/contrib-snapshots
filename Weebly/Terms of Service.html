<br>
<br> Weebly is often used by Designers to design websites for a third party.
Such use is explicitly permitted under the Designer Platform terms above.
Should you design websites for third parties on any other version of Weebly, such sites must each have their own account controlled by the third party, and you may not group multiple client sites under one account owned by you.
</p> 17.
Domain Name Registration, Domain Name Cancellation, and Change of Registrar <p>For the domain name registration services (the “Domain Services”) provided directly to you by Weebly, the following terms and conditions also apply.
Your use of the Domain Services provided by Weebly serves as your consent to these terms.
Some of the service packages include Weebly registering an Internet domain name or renewing your existing domain name (the “Domain Name”) on your behalf.
For the purpose of procuring and/or maintaining domains, Weebly will act only as the agent between you and the organization responsible for domain name allocation (the “Registrar”), which will be Register.com.
All new registrations and subsequent renewals of those registrations will therefore also be subject to the Register.com terms and conditions located at: http://www.register.com/policy/servicesagreement.rcmx.
Weebly reserves the right to utilize another domain name service provider at any time, in which case the terms and condition of such organization will apply complementarily to these Domain Terms.
<br>
<br> Weebly may provide one (1) free domain name for up to one year, with a new purchase of an annual or bi-annual subscription plan.
The domain will be included for the lifetime of your Weebly account, and the domain will be registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you cover any applicable domain registration fees following the first year.
The free domain name only applies to certain top-level domains (e.g.
.com, .net, and .org) when signing up for a new plan.
<br>
<br> You are responsible for providing correct and complete data regarding the domain name holder (“Registrant”) and the administrative contact when registering the domain name.
The technical contact in all cases will be Weebly, Inc.
Before applying for a domain name, it is your responsibility to check that the domain name does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene existing legislation.
We may defer activation of a domain name until payment of the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.
Weebly is in no position to influence the allocation of the domain name by the Registrar.
We can neither guarantee that the requested domain names will be allocated to you and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor guarantee their continued existence.
Any information we provide regarding the availability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties and only refers to the time that information is requested.
The domain will not be deemed as allocated before registration of the domain in the name of you, the Registrant, and its entry in the database of the Registrar.
<br>
<br> The initial registration term for purchased domains may vary and such registration will auto-renew for successive 12-month periods.
You will be charged for auto-renewal forty-five (45) calendar days before your domain expires (even if that date differs from your Weebly website subscription renewal date).
You can, of course, opt out of auto-renewal by turning off the auto-renew option in your settings at any time before the auto-renewal takes effect.
Each purchased domain name is registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you pay the applicable fees.
If you purchase a new domain, or renew an existing domain, and cancel your purchase within the first thirty (30) days by contacting http://hc.weebly.com, you may receive a full refund.
Your right and title to your domain name allows you to transfer a purchased domain to another domain provider.
however, you will not be eligible for a refund of registration fees paid to Weebly for transferred domains.
Regardless of the identity of the Registrant or any other contact information in your domain name records, any domain name registered through Weebly using your Weebly account is covered by these Terms.
<br>
<br> Maintaining accurate and current billing information is a mandatory condition of maintaining your Weebly account.
Such data must include the full and real name of the Registrant, a physical mailing address (PO boxes or anonymous addresses are not permissible), a valid email address and telephone number.
If this information changes, you must immediately inform us of this change by updating it online.
Please note that if your billing information, including your current credit card information, is not current, we will not renew your Domain Services and they may subsequently expire.
<br>
<br> Subject to these Terms and those of the Registrar, you may transfer all domain names registered through us to another registrar by following the online instructions provided by Weebly.
Should we, due to failure on the part of you, the account holder, or the new registrar, be unable to make the domain transfer to your new registrar, we are expressly entitled to have the cancelled domain name deleted by the relevant registrar after the cancellation date has lapsed.
We reserve the right to allow domain transfers only if you have settled all undisputed pending claims with us.
<br>
<br> It may not always be possible to recover a domain name after it has expired, and Weebly has sole discretion in determining when a domain name can be renewed post-expiry and what fees will be applicable.
If you forfeit a domain name for non-payment, Weebly will have the right, in its sole discretion, to: (a) register and use the domain name for its own purpose.
(b) sell or transfer the domain name to a third party.
or (c) delete the domain name and allow any new registrant anywhere in the world to register the domain name anew.
Further, you agree that Weebly may charge the credit card you have on file with Weebly to recover any amounts outstanding on your account.
<br>
<br> On certain occasions, domain name registrations may become the subject of a legal challenge.
If Weebly is made a party to any legal action by virtue of one of your domain name registrations, you agree to be responsible for all of Weebly’s costs and legal fees and to indemnify and hold Weebly harmless from any action.
If Weebly is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Weebly may, at its sole discretion: (a) suspend your ability to use, make modifications to, or transfer your registration records.
and/or (b) deposit control of your registration record with the appropriate judicial entity by supplying a registrar certificate from us.
<br>
<br> You must notify us immediately if you lose the rights to a domain name registered by Weebly on your behalf.
</p> 18.
Email Marketing Service <p>For the email marketing services provided directly to you by Weebly (the “Email Marketing Service”), the following terms and conditions also apply.
<strong>Your use of the Email Marketing Service serves as your consent to these terms.</strong> Weebly may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Email Marketing Service if you do not comply with these terms.</p>
<p> Your use of the Email Marketing Service must comply with all applicable domestic and international laws.
This includes the laws applicable to you and also laws applicable to Weebly and all recipients to whom you intend to send emails (each a “Recipient”).
Examples of applicable laws include laws relating to spam or unsolicited commercial email (hereinafter “Spam” or “UCE”), privacy, security, obscenity, defamation, intellectual property, pornography, terrorism, homeland security, gambling, child protection, and other applicable laws.
It is your responsibility to know and understand the laws applicable to your use of the Email Marketing Service and the emails you generate and send through the Email Marketing Service.
Your use of the Email Marketing Service must also comply with the Privacy Notice applicable to the Email Marketing Service.
Weebly’s Privacy Notice is available here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You are solely responsible for your products and services and any other promotion and Content contained in or referred to in your emails sent through the Email Marketing Service.
You agree to use the Email Marketing Service in a lawful, safe, and professional manner, consistent with industry best practices, including keeping reliable records.
You are solely responsible for any and all statements you make and for all user assistance, warranty and support of your products and services.</strong>
</p>
<p> Your use of the Email Marketing Service must follow all applicable guidelines established by Weebly.
The guidelines below are examples of practices that may violate these Terms when generating or sending email or messages through the Email Marketing Service: </p>
<p>
<b>You will not:</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Email Marketing Service in violation of Weebly’s Terms of Service or of any law applicable to you or your Recipients;</li>
<li> Use the Email Marketing Service to send Spam.
You must ensure that all Recipients have explicitly granted permission to receive emails from you by affirmatively opting-in to receive those emails.
All emails and messages sent by means of the Email Marketing Service must comply with our Anti-Spam Policy, as outlined below: <ol>
<li>Weebly has a no tolerance Spam policy and does not knowingly do business with any user or company that participates in sending Spam/UCE.
We do not sell or exchange personal information from our opt-in lists.</li>
<li>An email is Spam if: (a) the recipient’s personal identity and context are irrelevant because the message is equally applicable to many other potential recipients.
(b) the recipient has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit and still-revocable permission for it to be sent.
and (c) the transmission and reception of the message appears to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.
</li>
<li>Spam is an issue of consent, not content.
A recipient should “affirmatively opt-in,” or expressly consent to receiving the message, either in response to a clear and conspicuous request or at the recipient’s own initiative.
</li>
<li>The U.S.
CAN-SPAM Act regulates and establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
Other international regulations and laws also apply to electronic marketing, and while we cannot give legal advice, we encourage you to become familiar with these laws, especially if you live in or mail to recipients outside the U.S.
</li>
<li>If you receive Spam complaints or run into compliance problems, or if Weebly identifies a potentially problematic contact list, we will first ask questions to try to understand your business as well as your marketing goals.
If we determine that a list is not consent-based or is too old or problematic to work with, we will require that it be removed from your account.
In certain instances, we may ask you to find another service provider because our goals are simply not compatible.
</li>
<li>Please refer to our Email Marketing FAQ located in the Help Center for further guidance on how to become a responsible mailer, as well as the additional ways that Weebly helps protect against sending unwanted or unsolicited email.</li>
<li>If you feel a Weebly user is sending unsolicited email, you can report it to us by sending it to abuse@weebly.com.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use the Email Marketing Service to request, collect or send any non-public or personally identifiable information about another user or any other person without their express prior written consent (or the parent’s consent in the case of a minor), illegal information, or any other information you do not have the right to request, collect or distribute;</li>
<li>Use the Email Marketing Service to send email campaigns that link to or display pornography, other sexually explicit content, illegal goods or services, or any other Content that Weebly deems inappropriate;</li>
<li>Transmit any message, information, data, text, software or image, or other Content that is not owned by you or legally licensed to you, or is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable which may violate another’s right of privacy or publicity;</li>
<li>Send through the Email Marketing Service any unethical, false or misleading advertising, promotions, or sales efforts and practices;</li>

<li>Use purchased or rented email lists;</li>

<li>Send emails that result in an unacceptable number of Spam or UCE complaints (even if the emails themselves were not actually Spam or UCE);</li>
<li>Disable or fail to include a working “unsubscribe” link in every email, which allows the Recipient/s to remove themselves from your mailing list.
Each such link must remain operational for at least 60 days after the date on which you send the message, and you agree that you will not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable the link;</li>
<li>Disable or fail to comply with any request from a recipient to be removed from your mailing list within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the request.
You cannot charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifiable information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an unsubscribe request.
As required under the U.S.
CAN-SPAM Act and other applicable laws, you acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining and honoring the list of unsubscribe requests following termination of your Weebly account, for any reason whatsoever;</li>
<li>Disguise the origin or subject matter of any email or falsify or manipulate the originating email address, subject line, headers, or transmission path information for any email.
For any email or message sent by you using the Email Marketing Service, (a) the “from” line must accurately and in a non-deceptive manner identify your identity or your organization’s identity.
and (b) the “subject” line of your email must relate to the email’s actual content and must not contain any deceptive or misleading content regarding the overall subject matter of the email message.
You agree that you are the sole or designated sender of any email you send through the Email Marketing Service, pursuant to any law or act applicable to your use of the Email Marketing Service (e.g., U.S.
CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, S.C.
2010, c.
23 and Directive 2003/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002), and as such you are required to comply with such laws and any other laws in other jurisdictions that apply to your use of the Email Marketing Service, and be responsible for any violation of any such applicable laws.
</li>
<li>Fail to include in each email your valid physical mailing address (which if you are located in the United States, may be a valid post office box meeting the registration requirements established by the United States Postal Service) or a link to that information.
For Recipients based in the EU, each email must additionally include the sender’s business registration number and VAT ID or a link to that information;</li>
<li>Include “junk mail”, “chain letters”, “pyramid schemes”, incentives (e.g., coupons, discounts, awards, or other incentives) or other material in any email that encourages a Recipient to forward the email to another recipient.
and </li>
<li>Fail to comply with export and import regulations for the U.S.
and other countries.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>Some industries yield higher than normal abuse rates for Spam.
Thus, Email Marketing Service may not be used on behalf of certain industries and senders.
This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

</p>
