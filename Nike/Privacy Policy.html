<strong>WHO is Responsible for the Processing of Your Personal Data?</strong>
</p>
<p>Nike, Inc.
(referred to as "Nike", “our”, "we" or “us” in this privacy policy)</p>
<p>
<strong>WHAT Personal Data Do We Collect and WHEN?</strong>
</p>
<p>We ask you for certain personal data to provide you with the products or services you request.
For example, when you make purchases, contact our consumer services, request to receive communications, create an account, participate in our events or contests, or use our Sites or Apps. </p>
<p>This personal data includes your:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>contact details including name, email, telephone number and shipping, billing address;</li>
<li>login and account information, including screen name, password and unique user ID;</li>
<li>personal details including gender, hometown, date of birth and purchase history;</li>

<li>images, photos and videos;</li>
<li>data on physical characteristics, including weight, height, and body measurements (such as estimated stride and shoe/foot measurements or apparel size);</li>
<li>fitness activity data provided by you or generated through our Sites or Apps (time, duration, distance, location, calorie count, pace/stride).
or</li>
<li>personal preferences including your wish list as well as marketing preferences.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>We collect additional personal data from you to enable particular features within our Sites and Apps.  For example, we request access to your phone’s location data to log your run route, your contacts to allow you to interact with your friends, your calendar to schedule a training plan or your social network credentials to post content from an App to a social network.  This personal data includes your:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>movement data from your device’s accelerometer;</li>
<li>photos, contacts and calendar information;</li>
<li>sensor data, including heart rate and (GPS) location data.
or</li>
<li>social network information, including credentials and any information from your public posts about Nike or your communications with us.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>When interacting with our Sites and Apps, certain data is automatically collected from your device or web browser.  This data includes:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Device IDs, call state, network access, storage information and battery information.
and</li>
<li>Cookies, IP addresses, referrer headers, data identifying your web browser and version, and web beacons and tags.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>KIDS</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13. </p>
<p>
<strong>TOOLS to Manage What Personal Data We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p>When using our Apps and Sites, we also provide in-time notice or obtain consent for certain practices.
For example, we will obtain consent to use your location or send push notifications.
We may obtain this consent through the Apps or Sites or using the standard permissions available on your device.</p>
<p>In many cases, your web browser or mobile device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to control when your device collects or shares particular categories of personal data.  For example, your mobile device or web browser may offer tools to allow you to manage cookie usage or location sharing.  We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and use the tools available on your devices.   </p>
<p>At this time, we do not respond to “do not track” signals sent by web browsers.</p>
<p>
<strong>WHY and HOW Do We Use Your Personal Data?</strong>
</p>
<p>We use your personal data in the following ways:</p>
<p>
<strong>       To Provide the Features of the Sites, Apps, and Services You Request</strong> </p>
<p>When you use our Sites and Apps, we will use your personal data to provide the requested product or service.  For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion.
If you contact our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question. </p>
<p>If you use our Apps to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this personal data and store it so that you can review it in the App.  Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location data and movement data.  We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the App. </p>
<p>In many cases, to use particular features within our Sites and Apps you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.  For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Apps, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device.
Similarly, to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials to sign in.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the contact details you provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted-out).
In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information.</p>
<p>We may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or services - such as your use of Nike’s Sites and Apps, your visits to or purchases made in Nike stores, your participation in Nike events and contests (possibly through other Nike affiliates) - to personalize communications and advertisements regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you.  For registered users, this may include data collected from your interactions with our Sites and our Apps that are associated with your account across devices.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</strong> </p>
<p>We use the personal data you provide to us to operate our business.  For example, when you make a purchase, we use that information for accounting, audits and other internal functions.  We may use personal data about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Sites and Apps.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety</strong> </p>
<p>We may also use personal data about how you use our Sites and Apps to prevent, detect, or investigate fraud, abuse, illegal use, violations of our Terms of Use, and to comply with court orders, governmental requests or applicable law.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>For General Research and Analysis Purposes</strong> </p>
<p>We use data about how our visitors use our Sites, Apps and services to understand customer behavior or preferences.  For example, we may use information about how visitors to Nike.com search for and find products to better understand the best ways to organize and present product offerings in our storefront. </p>
<p>
<strong>Use of Workout Info </strong>
<strong>                                                                                                    </strong>
</p>
<p>As discussed above, Nike collects data about your fitness activity or your physical characteristics, together, “Workout Info”, to provide our Apps and other services.  Because of the personal nature of this data, we strive to provide you with clear information about how Workout Info will be used.  As this data may be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions, we take appropriate measures in protecting and using this data and, where required by applicable law or under Nike’s internal policies, will obtain your consent for use of your Workout Info.  Click here FAQ on Workout Info to learn more.</p>
