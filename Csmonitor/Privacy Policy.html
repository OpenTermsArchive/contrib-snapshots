<p>
<b>What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?</b>
</p>
<p>First: this site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals, for instance, when purchasing a subscription to our Monitor Extra service.</p>
<p>In particular, when purchasing a subscription, you must provide contact information (like name, e-mail and shipping address) and may provide financial information (like credit card number, expiration date) to be used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders.
If the site has trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.</p>
<p>We do collect anonymous, aggregated data from our website and e-mail newsletters and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes.
The Christian Science Monitor may use such information to help determine ways to improve our site.
The Christian Science Monitor reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its website and e-newsletter visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.
Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.</p>
<p>We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site.
These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>
<p>The Christian Science Monitor supplies some of its subscriptions and content, such as the Treeless Edition and Historic Archive 1901 - 1980, through third parties.
These services and purchases are processed by third-parties on behalf of The Christian Science Monitor, and such third-parties collect and store billing and credit card information solely to process these purchases.
This information will not be used for any other reason except as instructed by the Monitor.</p>
<p>Generally, we do not provide, sell or lease personally identifiable information to any third parties.
However, if you provide us with your postal address when subscribing to the print edition we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties.
If you would like us to stop including your postal address in such lists, please send us a letter addressed to The Christian Science Monitor, P.O.
Box 98, Boston, MA 02117-0098, or please e-mail us, requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists.

<p>You will receive advertising information from the Monitor when you sign up to receive such information on the Monitor E-mail Services page.</p>
<p>If you submit your email address to the site in other ways, such as submitting a comment or question, we may contact you about receiving occasional offers from advertisers.</p>

</p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Finally, parents should be aware that if a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address, etc.
