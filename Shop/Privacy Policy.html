<p> About This Statement </p> What this statement applies to: <p> Your privacy is important to Lenovo.
This privacy statement applies to websites owned and operated by Lenovo Group Ltd and its affiliated group companies ("Lenovo").
This policy describes the information practices for Lenovo websites (such as https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en, https://canada.lenovo.com/fr, https://www3.lenovo.com/ca/en/, http://lenovocareers.com, http://blog.lenovo.com), including what type of information is collected, how the information is used, with whom the information is shared, and how the information is protected.

</p> Changes to this statement: <p> If we make a change to this statement, we will make previous versions available upon request so that you can see when changes occurred and what they are.
If we make any material changes to this statement, we will notify you by means of a notice on this site or by an email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) prior to the change becoming effective.
Where we are required by applicable data protection laws, we will also seek your consent to any material changes that affect how we use your personal information.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.

<p> What information does Lenovo collect through its websites? </p>
<p> Lenovo collects the following information from visitors to its websites: </p> Information you provide to us voluntarily: <p> In general, you can visit Lenovo's websites without providing any identifying personal information other than the information we collect automatically.
There are times, however, when we (or suppliers working for us) may need information from you.
You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations.
For example, we may collect personal information about you when you place an order with Lenovo, such as name, address, email address, phone numbers, payment card information, information used to personalize a Lenovo product or software experience, social security number (or equivalent national identification number), date of birth and other information you choose to provide.
Lenovo uses this information to facilitate order processing and to enable us to contact you if a problem arises with your order.
Additionally, if you purchase a product requiring service, your personal information may be used to obtain a credit report, if necessary.
Please note that if you do not provide us with personal information where required, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you have requested.
</p>
<p> We may ask you for and collect personal information at other times, including when you enter sweepstakes, a contest or other promotion.
when you subscribe to receive Lenovo marketing communications or newsletters.
when you complete surveys.
when you participate in a user forum or blog.
or when you interact with Lenovo at a trade show, conference or similar event.
We use the information you provide to help us design and improve our website and our products, to customize your online experience, to provide advice and purchase recommendations, and for other purposes consistent with this policy.
</p>
<p> Lenovo also conducts research on our users' demographics (e.g.
age, gender), interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us when making a purchase, during a promotion, from surveys and from our server log files.
We do this to better understand and serve you.
This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis so as to prevent identification of personal information relating to any one individual.
Lenovo may share this aggregated data with our suppliers.
</p>
<p> Finally, we may also ask for your personal information when you express an interest in employment opportunities at Lenovo by submitting an application through our websites.
The information we collect from you will be made apparent at the time you are submitting your application, and we will use this information only to evaluate your employment candidacy.
</p> Information we collect automatically: <p> Our web server logs collect the domain names and certain related data of visitors to our web sites automatically (such as their IP address or device identifier).
This information is used to measure number of visits, average time spent on a Lenovo website, pages viewed and website usage information.
We use this information to meet legal or regulatory requirements.
to measure the use of our sites.
to improve the content of our sites.
and to provide tailored advertisements.
This information is not used in a form that would enable direct identification of any of our visitors.
We may collect this information using cookies, as explained below under the section <em>"Does Lenovo user cookies, web beacons, analytics and related technologies for online advertising and other purposes?”</em>
</p> Information we collect from other sources: <p> From time-to-time, we may supplement information you give us via a Lenovo website with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses.
This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.
</p>
<p> How does Lenovo use and share the information it collects through its websites? </p>
<p> The following sections describe in more detail how Lenovo may use your personal information and with whom we may share it.
Depending on the type of Lenovo website you are visiting, one or more of the sections may apply.
</p>
<p> We may share your personal information with contracted suppliers who are providing services to Lenovo such as fulfilling orders and delivering packages, payment processing and providing customer services.
These suppliers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
In some cases, Lenovo uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf.
It is Lenovo’s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with our policies.
</p> When You Request or Order Something: <p> If you request or order something from a Lenovo website, such as a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request.
To help us do this, we may share information with others, for instance, other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo's service providers, vendors, suppliers, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in the fulfillment of your request.
In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.
To opt-out of surveys and/or other market research communications, see the section below headed "Marketing." </p> Lenovo ID and Product Registration: <p> When you create a Lenovo ID or register your Lenovo product, we will collect information, including personal information, about you and your Lenovo device(s).
In addition to your Lenovo ID, we may ask you to provide your name, email address, language and region/country, device type/model, IP address, device serial number, date of device registration, and any activation data about your operating system.
</p>
<p> We use your Lenovo ID to identify you when you use our online services, like our online store and customer support site.
If you wish to deactivate your Lenovo ID, you may do so at any time by contacting privacy@lenovo.com.
</p> Marketing: <p> The information you provide on certain Lenovo websites may also be used by Lenovo and selected suppliers or partners for marketing purposes, such as when you subscribe to receive marketing communications or newsletters, or when you enter sweepstakes, a contest or promotion.
Before this information is collected we may offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.
You may choose to stop receiving our marketing communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in those communications, accessing the marketing preferences in your account settings page, or you can contact us at privacy@lenovo.com.
</p> Testimonials: <p> Lenovo sometimes displays product reviews, testimonials and other endorsements of satisfied customers on our site.
With your consent, we may post your comments along with your name.
If you want to update or delete your comments, you can contact us at privacy@lenovo.com.

Please note that, in some cases, we may record and retain such calls for staff training and quality assurance purposes.
If you do not wish the call to be recorded, please notify the call taker.
</p> Business Partner Relationships: <p> If you represent a Lenovo business partner (i.e.
a distributor or reseller of Lenovo products), you may visit a Lenovo website intended specifically for Lenovo business partners.
We may use personal information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, and the company you represent.
For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of Lenovo business partner programs.
It may also include sharing certain information with other business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Lenovo customers or prospects.
In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.
</p> Supplier Administration: <p> If you represent a Lenovo supplier, you may visit a Lenovo website intended specifically for use by Lenovo suppliers.
We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you.
For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo's business partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions, postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment of a transaction.
It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent and/or other Lenovo suppliers generally.
</p> Disclosures Required by Law: <p> In certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
Therefore, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, we may disclose personal or other information to regulatory or government bodies, courts of law, tribunals, and law enforcement bodies to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
</p> Blogs &amp.
Discussion Forms: <p> If you participate in a Lenovo blog or discussion forum, you should be aware that the information you provide there may be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Lenovo, who have access to that blog, discussion forum, or chat room.
Also, please recognize that individual blogs, forums, and chat rooms may be hosted by organizations other than Lenovo and/or may have additional rules and conditions.
Each participant's opinion on a blog, forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Lenovo.
</p> Social media features &amp.
widgets: <p> Some of our websites include social media features and links, such as a social bar with icons that link to the Lenovo presence on that specific site (e.g., the Lenovo page on Facebook, the Lenovo feed on Twitter).
These features may collect your IP address and information on which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by another company or are hosted directly on our site.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p> Single Sign On: <p> You can log in to certain areas of our websites using sign-in services, such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.
These services will authenticate your identity.
provide you the option to share certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us, and to pre-populate our sign up form.
Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this website to your profile page to share with others within your network.
</p> Frames &amp.
Powered-By Sites: <p> Some of our pages use framing techniques to serve content from suppliers or partners while preserving the look and feel of our site.
In addition, certain Lenovo-branded websites may be operated by suppliers or partners may be designated by a "powered-by" logo.
Please be aware that such sites may be governed by the privacy practices and policies of our suppliers or partners and not necessarily those of Lenovo or Lenovo.com.
</p> Mergers &amp.
Acquisitions: <p> Circumstances may arise when, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Lenovo decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.
</p>
<p>
<em>Other Sources</em>
</p>
<p> In addition to the above, there may circumstances which require us to disclose your personal information to parties in addition to those listed above, including, but not limited to, legal advisers or debt collection agencies.
</p>
<p> Does Lenovo transfer my personal information internationally? </p>
<p> Lenovo is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.
Therefore, where permitted by law, we may share your personal information within Lenovo (including to subsidiaries, affiliates and parent companies) or our suppliers and business partners and may transfer it to other countries in the world where we do business (including, but not limited to, the United States of America and China).
Regardless of where your information is transferred to and resides, our privacy and security practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information globally.
</p>
<p> Please note that some countries have privacy laws that are not equivalent to privacy laws in your own country.
In such countries, Lenovo will still handle information in the manner we describe here and will take such measures as are necessary to comply with applicable data protection laws when transferring and processing your information.
Where required, Lenovo will also maintain agreements between Lenovo group companies or with Lenovo partners or suppliers to govern the transferring, processing and protection of personal information.
</p>
<p> In addition to the privacy practices set out in this policy, Lenovo’s Motorola Mobility business has established a set of "Binding Corporate Rules" for internal transfers between Motorola Mobility group companies in the European Union and Motorola Mobility group companies elsewhere.
These have been approved by certain European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Motorola Mobility to adequately protect personal information that Motorola Mobility processes regardless of where the information resides.
A full copy of the rules can be found here.
For additional information, please contact privacy@lenovo.com.
</p>
<p> Does Lenovo use cookies, web beacons, analytics and related technologies for online advertising and other purposes? </p>
<p> As is true of most websites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files.
We sometimes collect information about our visitor's behavior during their visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service, to improve the quality of our website experiences or to tailor advertising.
</p>
<p> For example, we keep track of the domains from which visitors come to our website, and we also measure visitor activity on Lenovo websites, but we do so in ways that do not enable the actual identity of any visitor (we call this "non-identifiable information" below).
Lenovo or others on Lenovo's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics, to improve our websites and to serve targeted advertising.
</p> Clickstreams: <p> When we collect personal information from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information.
This information is sometimes called a "clickstream”.
This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns.
This information is not reviewed at an individual level.

</p> Local Storage Objects: <p> Additionally, we may use local storage objects (LSOs) such as Flash cookies and HTML5 to store content information and preferences.

</p>
<p> This information may be used to measure website trends and to deliver a Lenovo product advertisement while browsing a website including non-Lenovo websites.
These ads are delivered based on a user’s visit to the Lenovo website.
Lenovo and its suppliers, including Google and DoubleClick, use cookies to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to Lenovo’s website.
</p>
<p> If you don't want to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out.
You will still continue to receive generic ads.
</p> Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-Op: <p> Lenovo participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Cooperative to better understand how you use certain websites and apps of ours across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions.
Learn more about how Adobe does this and how you may opt-out of this program.
</p> Web beacons and other technologies: <p> Some Lenovo websites also use web beacon or other technologies such as Java scripts and etags to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service.
These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Lenovo websites.
When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated.
This may be processed by us or by our suppliers.
These web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.
If you turn off cookies, web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.
</p> Personalized URL Links: <p> On occasion, we may personalize and customize websites for certain visitors.
If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Lenovo and information you have provided to us.
While you are visiting these websites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests.
An invitation to visit one of these websites can be presented as a personalized URL in an email, a notice on a website registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain website.
</p>
<p> If you choose to visit one of these websites, Lenovo will collect information about your visits and associate with other information about you and your relationship with Lenovo.
If you do not want your information to be used in this way, please do not visit these sites.
</p> How long will my personal information be retained? <p> We will retain your personal information only for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services.

</p>
<p> How is my information secured? </p>
<p> Lenovo implements appropriate technical and organizational measures and processes to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality both during transmission and once it is received.
For example, we use encryption when transmitting sensitive information such as a credit card number to help us to keep your information secure.
</p>
<p>
<em>

</em> As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your personal information, Lenovo cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of any information you provide to us or from our website and therefore you use our site at your own risk.
Information on how to report security questions, issues or possible incidents to the Lenovo Information Security Team can be found here.
</p>
<p> What about my child’s privacy? </p>
<p> Websites operated by or on behalf of Lenovo are intended for use by persons age 16 and over.
Lenovo does not seek to collect information about children under the age of 16.
No information should be submitted to or posted on Lenovo's websites by users under 16 years of age.
</p>
<p> If a child under the age of 16 submits personal information to Lenovo's web sites, we delete the information as soon as we discover it was provided by a child under 16 years of age and do not use it for any purpose.
Lenovo encourages parents to take an active role in their child(ren)'s use of the Internet and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet.
</p>
