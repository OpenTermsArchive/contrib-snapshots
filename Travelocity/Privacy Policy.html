</p>
<p>
<i>Automatic Logging of Session Data</i>
<br> We automatically log generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data".
Session data consists of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by the user while using the Travelocity Service.
An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view.
We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting.
It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems.
It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
We may also use some session data, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail messages (such as "Good Day to Buy") focused on destinations that you may be interested in, unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages.
We also use session data to help prevent fraud or unauthorized use of our site.
</p>
<p>

<i>Submitted Content</i>
<br> You can contribute to the Travelocity Service in a number of different ways, including by providing journals, recommendations, reviews, opinions, news articles, directories, guides, text, photographs, illustrations, graphics, logos, audio clips, images, information, data, photographs, software, messages, ideas, comments, questions, or other materials for public display on the Travelocity Service (your "Submitted Content").

We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Submitted Content.</p>
<p>
<i>Third Party Services </i>
<br> We may allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, that enable you to share your selected Submitted Content with those services, and import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them using the Travelocity Service.
Where we provide such functionality, such as on IgoUgo.com, you can always opt out on your IgoUgo account page.
Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of the Travelocity Service.
For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on the Travelocity Service (including on IgoUgo.com).
You can, at any time, adjust your IgoUgo settings to remove this feature, by changing your Facebook preferences on the site.
You can also further modify your privacy settings with those other services directly.
For example, you can adjust your privacy settings on Facebook to prevent your Facebook friends from sharing information about you from their Facebook accounts with us.</p>
<p>
<i>Location-specific information</i>
<br> If you use our location-enabled products and services, such as our mobile applications, you may be sending us location information.
This information may reveal your actual location, such as GPS data, or it may not, such as when you submit an address to look at hotel choices in that location.
We use your location information to process and personalize your requests, such as by pre-filling the city name when you are searching for a nearby hotel.
We also use location information for support, to develop new features, a better user experience and to improve the overall quality of the Travelocity Service.</p>
<p>
<i>Other</i>
<br> From time to time we may add or enhance services available using the Travelocity Service.
To the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested.
For example, if you email us with a question, we will use information such as your email address, name and the nature of the question, to respond to your question.
We may also store such information to assist us in making the Travelocity Service better and easier to use.
</p>
<br>
<p> With whom (if anyone) will my personal information be shared?<br>
</p>
<p> When you book travel using the Travelocity Service, we provide to the airline, hotel, car-rental company, cruise line or other involved Third Party Supplier only that portion of your personal information that is needed for the successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements.
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such Third Party Suppliers as their policies may be materially different from this Privacy Policy.
We may also share personal information among our corporate affiliates at Sabre Holdings Corporation.
For example, we book most of our travel services through the Sabre Global Distribution System, a leading processor of travel bookings worldwide which is operated by an affiliated company, and in doing so must provide certain of your personal information to them (as we would with any other GDS we now use or may use in the future).
The Sabre privacy policy is available at http://sabre-holdings.com/privacy/coreData.html.
When using a mobile device, note that all requests must be sent through your mobile carrier's or Wi-Fi provider's network and your carrier or provider may have access to the personal information being transmitted.
For information regarding your carrier's or Wi-Fi provider's treatment of your personal information, please consult their applicable privacy policies.
</p>
<p> We use non-personal information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our site.
We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners.
We may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites.
Occasionally, Travelocity will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing, or will contract with a third party to provide co-branded products, such as a Travelocity credit card.
In such cases, Travelocity will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects.
The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for the purpose(s) for which it has been provided.
See "What other information should I know about my privacy?" below.

</p>
<p> What other information should I know about my privacy?<br>
</p>

In addition, if Travelocity or substantially all of its assets are acquired, the personal information of our customers will also most likely be transferred in connection with such acquisition.
</p>
<p> What we do NOT do: a warning about "phishing"<br>
</p>
<p> We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login name, or password, in an unsecure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>
