                      <h3>If you are in the European Region</h3>
                      <p><i>Our Legal Bases For Processing Information</i><br>We rely on a variety of legal bases to process personal data, including:</p>
                      <ul style="font-size: 17px">
                          <li>as necessary for the performance of a contract, for example to provide our Services;</li>
                          <li>consistent with your consent, which you can revoke at any time;</li>
                          <li>as necessary to comply with our legal obligations; and</li>
                          <li>necessary for our (or others’) legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative personalized, safe and profitable service to our users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights of freedoms that require protection of personal data.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      <p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time. Such withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i>How You Exercise Your Rights</i></p>
                      <p>Under applicable laws, you have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. You also have the right to object to and restrict certain processing of your personal data. This includes:</p>
                      <ul style="font-size: 17px">
                          <li>the right to object to our processing of your data for direct marketing, which you can exercise by using the “unsubscribe” link in such marketing communications,</li>
                          <li>the right to object to our processing of your data where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party, and</li>
                          <li>the right to delete information you have provided us.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i>Data Retention</i></p>
                      <p>We generally retain information until it is no longer necessary to serve the purposes for which it was collected. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i>Data Transfers</i></p>


                      <p>CrowdTangle is a corporation based in the United States and our customers are based throughout the world. Due to our location and the fact that we share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies and externally with our partners (including Platform Partners), and with those you connect and share information with around the world, operationally, we are not able to provide the Services without making these data transfers.
                          Where we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area or Switzerland ("EEA") to a country outside the EEA without an adequacy determination by the EU Commission (a “Restricted Country”, such as the United States), we do so in accordance with the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>
                      <p>Where we transfer personal information from the United Kingdom to a Restricted Country, we do so in accordance with the standard contractual clauses applicable in the United Kingdom.</p>
                      <p>When we enter into these arrangements, we ensure that your data subject rights are honoured and that you are able to raise concerns about these transfers (see How You Exercise Your Rights for more information). If you have any questions about these arrangements or wish to exercise any of your data subject rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@crowdtangle.com">privacy@crowdtangle.com</a>.</p>
                      <p>In addition to the contractual safeguards outlined above that CrowdTangle puts in place for personal information that is transferred from the EEA and/ or the United Kingdom to a Restricted Country, CrowdTangle is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States, as described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000PJWFAA4&amp;status=Active">certification</a>. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="http.://privacyshield.gov">http.://privacyshield.gov</a>. While CrowdTangle is certified under the Privacy Shield program, the current legal mechanisms for CrowdTangle’s international data transfers are the applicable adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, as explained in the paragraphs above.</p>
                      <p>Under the Privacy Shield Principles, individuals have the right to opt out of (i) disclosures of their personal information to third parties; or (ii) uses of their personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Individuals also have the right under the Privacy Shield Principles to access, correct, amend, or delete their personal information that is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
                      <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, CrowdTangle commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EEA and United Kingdom individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@crowdtangle.com">privacy@crowdtangle.com</a>. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
                      <p>The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over CrowdTangle’s compliance with the Privacy Shield. In certain circumstances, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration with respect to adherence to the Privacy Shield. If CrowdTangle shares personal information with certain third parties, CrowdTangle may be liable if those parties process that information in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
