Similarly, for our movie ticketing Services (e.g., Flixster, Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com), the only laws that shall apply are the laws of the countries in which the theaters ticketed by each respective Service are located.

It supplements certain sections of this Privacy Policy and provides additional information that should be read together with other sections of this Privacy Policy.
To the extent there is any conflict between this section and another section of this Privacy Policy, this section shall govern.
