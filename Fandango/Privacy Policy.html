A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN Fandango is not designed or intended for use by children under 13.
If you are under 18, you should use Fandango only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
Children under 13 may not submit any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
ANTI-SPAM POLICY Fandango is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam").

If you receive any unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that Fandango did not provide your email address to such parties.
This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet.
Unfortunately, spammers obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones.
Please be assured that at Fandango we hate spam as much as you do, and we do our best to avoid contributing to it.
All of our newsletters and other general email marketing communications also include an "unsubscribe" opt-out link that you may use to ask that we discontinue such emails to you.
(Even if you opt-out of our newsletter or other marketing communications, we may still send you certain transactional or administrative emails, such as email confirmations of ticket purchases, or emails regarding changes to your account.
) All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please contact us and we will investigate.
Please be assured that we strive not to contact anyone for marketing purposes without permission, and if you prefer not to receive any further marketing communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.
