What information does Buy.com collect from you?<br> In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, Buy.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.
<p>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>
<br> This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.
Personal information is requested when you register and set up an account, order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, apply for the Buy.com credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback.
For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details.
With this information, Buy.com can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.
For a few services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of other merchants and share it with them.
For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you for your social security number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that information with the third-party telephone service provider that you have selected.
<i>If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</i> If you have questions about their information practices, please read their privacy policies.
In many cases, you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services.
</p>
<p>
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i>
<br> This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.
We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways.
This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.
For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.
A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.
An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web.
Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.
In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
</p>
<p> On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded.
Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>

Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?<br> Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Buy.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience.
We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.
<p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site.
We review the actions of the Buy.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.
Buy.com also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys.
We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.
We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.
</p>
<p>We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors.
Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents").
Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or Buy.com.
</p>

<p>

If others place orders for items on your Gift List, they may have access to your address.
We will use the product preferences that you include in your Gift List to inform you about offers that may be of interest to you.
