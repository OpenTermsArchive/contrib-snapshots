conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be
chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance
by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (3) any judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any dispute resolution
proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class
or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private

agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for

Services and supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements, written or oral,
including any prior versions of the Terms of Service. These Terms of Service do not confer any third-party
beneficiary rights on any person or entity. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
provision or portion of these Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will
continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only
if in writing and signed by Mix. The provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature are continuing
will survive any termination.
