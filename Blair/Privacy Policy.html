<strong>Privacy Notices</strong>
<br> This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on this Site.
Generally, privacy notices provide details about the personal information we collect on particular pages or particular areas of this Site, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.
Our privacy notices are part of this Privacy Policy.</p>
