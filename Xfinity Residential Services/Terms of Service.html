    <h3><strong> CHARGES AND BILLINGS</strong></h3>
    <ul class="x-list--no-bullets">
        <li>
        <p><strong>a. You must pay certain charges, fees, and taxes</strong></p>
        <p>
        <strong>You agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay any
        monthly Service charges. </strong>We will give you notice of applicable pricing at the time of your order
        or activation of the Services. If you receive the Services at a
        promotional rate, our then-current standard pricing will apply to you at
        the end of the promotional period. You should consult our rate card for
        then-current standard charges. If you receive the Services under a
        minimum term agreement, we will charge you the specified price for the
        Services subject to the minimum term pricing for the duration of the
        minimum term agreement. All other pricing is subject to change at any
        time and from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You agree to pay all other charges associated with the Services. </strong>These may include charges for installation and service calls. These may
        also include fees identified at the time of your order or imposed after
        you begin receiving Services. You may incur charges for Xfinity
        Equipment (as defined in Section 7 below), purchases or rentals, or
        ancillary services. You may also incur measured and per-call charges.
        You can find price information for Voice at <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/corporate/about/phonetermsofservice/comcastdigitalvoice/cdvresidential" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xfinity.com/corporate/about/phonetermsofservice/comcastdigitalvoice/cdvresidential</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You agree to pay any applicable taxes and fees. </strong>These
        include applicable federal, state, and local taxes and fees (however
        designated), fees to recoup governmental or quasi-governmental
        assessments on us, and cost recovery charges. These include fees for any
        governmental or public programs in which we participate, such as public,
        educational, and governmental access, telecom relay services, and
        programs supporting the 911/E911 system.
        <strong>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY SUCH FEES AND TAXES (WHETHER
        IMPOSED ON YOU OR ON US), INCLUDING THOSE THAT BECOME APPLICABLE
        RETROACTIVELY.</strong>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>b. Third-party charges are your responsibility</strong></p>
        <p>
        In addition to the amounts we charge, you may incur charges from
        third-party services providers. These third parties may charge you for
        access to online services, telephone-based services, or other offerings.
        You are solely responsible for these third-party charges, including any
        applicable taxes. If we have agreed to provide billing services on
        behalf of a third party, you agree to make these payments to us. We will
        not be responsible for any disputes between you and any third party
        regarding any third-party charges.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>c. Changes to pricing, charges, and fees</strong></p>
        <p>
        Certain pricing, charges, and fees may change at any time and from time
        to time. In general, we will provide you with notice of any change in
        our standard prices or fees or new prices or fees. However, if there is
        a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees, or
        assessments, or in any third-party charges billed through us, we may not
        provide notice unless required by applicable law.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>d. How we bill you</strong></p>
        <p>
        We generally bill you monthly, in advance, for recurring monthly Service
        charges, equipment charges, and fees.
        <strong>UPON REQUEST, YOU MUST PAY THE FIRST MONTH&rsquo;S SERVICE CHARGES,
        XFINITY EQUIPMENT CHARGES, DEPOSITS, ACTIVATION FEES AND INSTALLATION
        CHARGES ON OR BEFORE THE DATE THAT WE INSTALL ANY OR ALL OF THE
        SERVICES. </strong>We may bill you for some Services individually after we provide the
        Services to you. For example, we may bill you for measured and per-call
        charges, pay-per-view movies or events, interactive television,
        e-commerce purchases, and other third-party services after you incur
        these charges.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Service charges will begin on one of the following dates, whichever
        occurs first: (i) the day you pick up Xfinity Equipment at our service
        center; (ii) the day you or we install the Services; (iii) the day your
        order for the Services is entered into our billing system, if Xfinity
        Equipment is not required; or (iv) five (5) days after the date we ship
        Xfinity Equipment to you.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>e. Payment methods</strong></p>
        <p>
        You may pay by credit card, debit card, check, or certain third-party
        services, and we may change the payment methods we accept from time to
        time. Certain additional terms may apply depending on your selected
        payment method. If we do not receive your payment by the due date, you
        agree to pay any amounts due upon demand, regardless of your selected
        payment method. If you pay by check, you authorize us to collect your
        check electronically. You may not make restrictive endorsements (such as
        &ldquo;paid in full&rdquo;) or other statements or releases on or with
        checks or other payments accepted by us. If you do so, we may disregard
        the restrictive endorsement or reject the payment.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>f. Our remedies if you pay late or fail to pay</strong></p>
        <p>
        If, for any reason, we do not receive payment for the full amounts
        billed to you by the due date, you may be billed additional fees,
        charges, and assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may accept a partial payment, but we still have the right to collect
        the full balance. We will apply any partial payment to outstanding
        charges in amounts and in the order we determine, in our sole
        discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Our fees are not interest or penalties. </strong>We expect you
        to pay amounts due on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to
        customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or
        non-payment will be difficult to calculate or predict, and are
        liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable estimate of our costs
        resulting from late payments and non-payments.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>We may charge fees for suspension or disconnection. </strong>If
        you fail to pay the full amount due for any or all charges, we may
        suspend or disconnect any or all of the Services without reducing fees
        or charges for the Services, in our sole discretion and subject to
        applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>We may charge fees to reconnect services. </strong>If you ask us
        to resume any Services after a suspension or disconnection, we may
        charge you additional installation or activation fees. These fees are in
        addition to all past-due charges and other fees. Reconnection of the
        Services is subject to this Agreement, and applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>We may charge you collection costs. </strong>We may use a
        collection agency or attorney to collect money you owe. If we do so, you
        agree to pay our reasonable costs of collection, including any
        collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, and
        arbitration or court costs.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>g. We have the right to make credit inquiries</strong></p>
        <p>
        <strong>YOU AUTHORIZE US TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT
        YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR
        FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES
        FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES. </strong>We will not discriminate in the application of our credit inquiries and
        deposit policy on the basis of race, color, sex, creed, religion,
        nationality, sexual orientation, or marital status. We (or third-party
        credit bureaus) will conduct risk assessments in accordance with all
        applicable laws.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>h. Contact us with billing questions or disputes</strong></p>
        <p>
        You may dispute charges on a bill or request billing credits. You must
        contact us within 120 days of the date on your bill, or you waive any
        disputes or credits, subject to applicable law and our binding legal
        obligations.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>i. We may require a refundable deposit</strong></p>
        <p>
        We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the
        Services, add Services, or fail to pay any amounts when they are due.
        Subject to applicable law, your deposit will be credited to your account
        (without interest) if your account remains in good standing for twelve
        (12) months. We may refund your deposit sooner if all of the Services
        are disconnected. We will provide this refund within thirty (30) days of
        Service disconnection and the return of all Xfinity Equipment, or within
        the timeline set by applicable law. Refund amounts are equal to the
        credit balance on your account, if any, minus any amounts due on your
        account. Amounts due on your account may include amounts owed for the
        Services, including for any Xfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered,
        or subject to an Unreturned Equipment Fee (as defined in Section 7(b)
        below).

        <p><strong>a.  Changes to Services, Rates, and Charges</strong></p>
        <p>
        We reserve the right to change the Services, rates, and charges at any
        time, with or without notice to you, to the extent permitted by
        applicable law. For example, we may delete or change content,
        programming, functionality, features, rate limitations, available
        speeds, or Xfinity Equipment. If we provide notice of such a change, it
        will be in accordance with Section 4(b), below. If any such change is
        material and negatively affects your Services, you have the right to
        cancel your Services; but you accept any such change if you continue to
        use or receive the Services for more than thirty (30) days after the
        change.
        </p>
        <p>
        We apply a monthly data consumption threshold to Xfinity Internet
        accounts. We retain the right to trial or adopt different data
        consumption thresholds or other usage plans for the Service at any time.
        If we do this we will notify you. You can learn about the data plan that
        applies in your area by going to <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dataplan.xfinity.com/</a>

        We reserve the right to make changes to this Agreement. We may deliver
        any notice concerning our relationship with you and any change to our
        relationship, including notice of any change to this Agreement, in any
        one or more of the following ways (at our discretion): (a) post notice

        information about the change on or with your bill for the Services; or
        (e) use any other method of notice reasonably determined by us to result
        in your receipt of such notice. You agree that any one of these methods
        is sufficient and effective notice. It is your responsibility to check
        your postal mail, email, service texts, and postings at
        <a href="www.xfinity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xfinity.com</a>, your &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; page, or another

        If any material change to our relationship with you, including any
        material change to this Agreement, negatively affects your Services, you

    <h3><strong>ACCESS TO YOUR PREMISES</strong></h3>
    <p>
    To provide you with the Services, we may need to enter your Premises. We
    may have our agents enter your Premises on our behalf. You agree that we
    (or our agents) may enter your Premises at reasonable times to install,
    configure, maintain, inspect, upgrade, replace, and remove the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
    You represent and warrant that you own the Premises or have obtained the
    authority to give us access to the Premises. If you do not own the
    Premises, you agree to supply the owner&rsquo;s name, address, and phone
    number, and evidence that the owner has approved our access, upon
    request.

    <h3><strong>CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT AND INSIDE WIRING</strong></h3>
    <ul class="x-list--no-bullets">
        <li>
        <p><strong>a. You may use your own Customer Equipment</strong></p>
        <p>
        &ldquo;Customer Equipment&rdquo; means software, hardware, or services
        used in connection with the Services that we (or our agents) do not
        provide or lease. Customer Equipment also includes certain equipment
        that you purchase from us (or our agents) under an express sale
        agreement. Customer Equipment does not include Xfinity Equipment for
        which you have paid an Unreturned Equipment Fee (as defined in Section
        7(b) below).
        </p>
        <p>
        You agree that we (or our agents) may access your Customer Equipment in
        order to configure, maintain, inspect, or upgrade it, set up Services,
        or install or download software. For example, we may send software,
        downloads, or updates remotely to modems, gateways, routers, and digital
        interactive televisions with CableCARDs. These updates may change, add,
        or remove features or functionality of your Customer Equipment or the
        Services.
        </p>
        <p>
        You represent and warrant that you own your Customer Equipment or have
        obtained the authority to give us access to your Customer Equipment. If
        you do not own your Customer Equipment, you agree to supply the
        owner&rsquo;s name, address, and phone number, and evidence that the
        owner has approved our access, upon request.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>b. You are solely responsible for your Customer Equipment</strong></p>
        <p>
        We may certify certain Customer Equipment or recommend particular
        configurations. Any other Customer Equipment or configuration may not
        meet our minimum technical or other specifications (a &ldquo;<strong>Non-Recommended Configuration</strong>&rdquo;). We reserve the right to deny support for the Services, or
        terminate the Services, if you use a Non-Recommended Configuration. WE
        AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 10 BELOW) MAKE NO
        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONS,
        WHICH COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT TO FAIL OR OTHERWISE CAUSE DAMAGE.
        WE AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR SUCH FAILURE OR DAMAGE.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>c. You are solely responsible for Inside Wiring</strong></p>
        <p>
        Wiring inside the Premises, including additional cable wiring, telephone
        wiring, and outlets, is &ldquo;<strong>Inside Wiring</strong>.&rdquo;
        Inside Wiring must not interfere with the Services or the normal
        operations of our cable network. Upon your request, we can install,
        repair, or maintain Inside Wiring. If we perform this work, we will
        charge you for that service. Regardless of who installed it, the Inside
        Wiring is your property, or the property of whomever owns the Premises.
        If you do not own the Premises, contact your landlord or building
        manager about the installation, repair, or maintenance of Inside Wiring.
        We have no responsibility for the operation, support, maintenance, or
        repair of Inside Wiring, except as set forth below.

    <h3><strong> XFINITY EQUIPMENT</strong></h3>
    <p>
    &ldquo;<strong>Xfinity Equipment</strong>&rdquo; means all new or
    reconditioned equipment that we or our agent provides or leases to you,
    including, but not limited to, cabling or wiring (except for Inside
    Wiring, as defined above) and related electronic devices, modems,
    routers, CableCARDs, and any other hardware and includes all software
    and programs contained within Xfinity Equipment or downloaded to
    Customer Equipment by us.
    </p>
    <ul class="x-list--no-bullets">
        <li>
        <p><strong>a. We own all Xfinity Equipment</strong></p>
        <p>
        You expressly agree that you will use the Xfinity Equipment exclusively
        in connection with the Services. You agree that all Xfinity Equipment
        belongs to us or other third parties and will not be deemed fixtures or
        in any way part of the Premises. We may remove or change the Xfinity
        Equipment at our discretion at any time the Services are active or
        following the termination of your Services. You acknowledge that any
        addition to, removal of, or change to the Xfinity Equipment may
        interrupt your Services. You may not sell, lease, abandon, or give away
        the Xfinity Equipment, or permit any other service provider to use the
        Xfinity Equipment, including Xfinity Equipment for which an Unreturned
        Equipment Fee has been paid. The Xfinity Equipment may only be used in
        the Premises unless expressly permitted by us. At your request, we may
        relocate the Xfinity Equipment for an additional charge. YOU UNDERSTAND
        AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THE XFINITY
        EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN THE PREMISES OR OTHERWISE
        EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY US, THE SERVICES MAY FAIL TO FUNCTION OR MAY
        FUNCTION IMPROPERLY. You agree that you will not allow anyone other than
        us or our agents to service the Xfinity Equipment. You are responsible
        for loss, repair, replacement, and other costs, damages, fees, and
        charges if you do not return the Xfinity Equipment to us in an undamaged
        condition.

        <li>
        <p><strong>b. You do not own Xfinity Equipment, even if you pay an Unreturned
        Equipment Fee</strong></p>
        <p>
        For avoidance of doubt, Xfinity Equipment remains Comcast-owned
        equipment, and Comcast retains title to all Xfinity Equipment, at all
        times, including but not limited to after payment of an Unreturned
        Equipment Fee. &ldquo;<strong>Unreturned Equipment Fee</strong>&rdquo;
        refers to a fee charged by Comcast to a subscriber for any unreturned
        Xfinity Equipment upon termination of the Services provided under this
        Agreement. The payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee shall not result
        in a sale of, or the transfer of title to, any Xfinity Equipment, and
        such Xfinity Equipment shall remain the property of Comcast, and Comcast
        retains title to Xfinity Equipment at all times. Comcast in no way
        relinquishes ownership of (including title to) Xfinity Equipment by the
        payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee. Even if an Unreturned Equipment
        Fee has been paid, Xfinity Equipment shall not be resold, used, or
        operated in any manner. If you pay an Unreturned Equipment Fee and
        subsequently return the Xfinity Equipment undamaged (with the exception
        of normal wear and tear), you will be refunded your Unreturned Equipment
        Fee in full.

    <h3><strong>USE OF THE SERVICES</strong></h3>
    <p>
    The Services are for personal, residential, non-commercial use only,
    unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing.
    </p>
    <p>We prohibit the following activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reselling the Services in whole or in part;</li>
        <li>
        Using the Services, directly or indirectly, for any unlawful purpose
        or in violation of any applicable policy that we make available to
        you;
        </li>
        <li>
        Using the Services to transmit, communicate, or store any information,
        data, or material in violation of any law, rule, or regulation;
        </li>
        <li>
        Tampering with, making any unauthorized connection to, or modifying
        any part of our cable network or the Services for any purpose;
        </li>
        <li>
        Attaching any unauthorized device to our cable network or the
        Services; or
        </li>
        <li>
        Attaching anything to the Inside Wiring, the Xfinity Equipment, or
        Customer Equipment that impairs the integrity of our cable network,
        that degrades our cable network&rsquo;s signal quality or strength, or
        that creates signal leakage.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You agree not to engage in these or other similar prohibited activities,
    or help anyone else do so. You acknowledge that you are accepting this
    Agreement on behalf of all persons who use the Services at your Premises
    (or any other locations authorized by us). You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that all other users of the Services understand and comply
    with this Agreement and any applicable policies. You are liable for all
    authorized and unauthorized use of the Services. If the Xfinity
    Equipment has been stolen or the Services have been used without your
    authorization or in violation of this Agreement, you agree to notify us
    immediately in writing, or by calling 1-800-XFINITY during normal
    business hours.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you violate this Agreement, or if you fail to notify us of
    unauthorized use in a timely manner, we may terminate the Services and
    recover damages. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
    precisely calculate our lost revenue from unauthorized Services or
    tampering, you agree to pay $500.00 per device used to receive
    unauthorized Services as liquidated damages. These liquidated damages
    are in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or
    unreturned Xfinity Equipment, or other equipment owned by us, including
    any incidental costs. The unauthorized reception of the Services may
    also result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, and we reserve the
    right to report any illegal activities to law enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
    In connection with your use of the Services, if you need to access
    third-party software or hardware, you will be subject to third-party
    terms and conditions. Certain components of the Services are also
    subject to our Software License Agreement, available at <a href="https://my.xfinity.com/terms/license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://my.xfinity.com/terms/license/</a>.

    Your use of certain Services may also be subject to acceptable use
    policies, available at <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.xfinity.com/policies</a>. For
    example, our Acceptable Use for Xfinity Internet Policy is available at <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/HighSpeedInternetAUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/HighSpeedInternetAUP</a>.

    <p>
    We may amend these policies and agreements from time to time, with or
    without notice to you. You should consult these policies and agreements
    regularly to comply with the most recent versions. We incorporate these
    additional policies and agreements (including any amendments) into this
    Agreement by reference. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT OR BLOCK ANY
    SERVICE USAGE AS WE DEEM NECESSARY TO PREVENT HARM TO OUR NETWORK,
    FRAUD, OR OTHER ABUSE OF THE SERVICES, OR AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY LAW.

    <h3><strong>TERMINATION</strong></h3>
    <p>
    This Agreement will remain in effect from Service activation until this
    Agreement is terminated (by us or by you), as described below. This
    Agreement may also be terminated if it is replaced by a revised
    agreement.
    </p>
    <ul class="x-list--no-bullets">
        <li>
        <p><strong>a. How you may terminate</strong></p>
        <p>
        If your Services are subject to a minimum term agreement, and you
        terminate all or any portion of the Services under the minimum term
        agreement before the end of the minimum term, you may be charged an
        early termination fee. Review your minimum term agreement for additional
        details.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your Services are not subject to a minimum term agreement, you may
        terminate the Services and this Agreement for any reason at any time.
        You must notify us that you want to terminate in one of the following
        ways: (a) mail a written notice to our local business office; (b) send
        an electronic notice to the email address specified on <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xfinity.com</a>; (c) provide notice in person at a service
        center; or (d) call our customer service number during normal business
        hours. Applicable fees and charges for the Services may accrue until the
        Services have been disconnected, all Xfinity Equipment has been
        returned, and this Agreement has been terminated, subject to applicable
        law or the terms of any agreements we have with governmental
        authorities. At our election, and subject to applicable law, we may
        change our policy to continue all Services (or any part of them) through
        the end of the billing cycle in which we received your notice, which
        means those Services will terminate at the end of the applicable billing
        cycle. We may refund all prepaid monthly service fees charged for the
        Services after the effective date of termination, and we reserve the
        right to subtract from your refund any outstanding amounts due to us for
        the Services, for any affiliate or third-party services, or for other
        applicable fees and charges. Certain fees and charges are non-refundable

        <p><strong>b. How we may terminate or suspend Services</strong></p>
        <p>
        Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to immediately terminate
        or suspend the Services without notice for any reason or no reason. We
        also reserve the right to remove from the Services any information
        stored or transmitted by or to any users (e.g., email or voicemail). We
        may take these actions if we reasonably determine that your use of the
        Services: (a) violates this Agreement, any applicable policies, or any
        laws, rules, or regulations; (b) interferes with our ability to provide
        the Services to you or to others; or (c) interferes with or endangers
        the health or safety of our personnel or third parties, including if you
        threaten, harass, or use vulgar or inappropriate language toward our
        personnel. We have discretion in deciding whether and why to terminate
        or suspend Services. If we continue providing Services, this does not
        mean we have reviewed or approved any use of the Services, or any
        information transmitted through the Services.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>c. You have certain obligations upon termination</strong></p>
        <p>
        You must cease all use of the Services as of the effective date of
        termination. You must pay in full for your use of the Services up to the
        date that this Agreement is terminated and the Services are disconnected
        (subject to applicable law).
        </p>
        <p>
        You must return all Xfinity Equipment to us at our local service center
        or to our designated agent within ten (10) days of the date on which the
        Services are disconnected. You must return the Xfinity Equipment in
        working order, with the exception of normal wear and tear. If you fail
        to return the Xfinity Equipment, we will charge you an Unreturned
        Equipment Fee. As the owner of the Xfinity Equipment at all times, we
        have the right to retrieve any equipment you fail to return. We (or our
        agents) may request access to your Premises to remove all Xfinity
        Equipment and other material provided by us during regular business
        hours at a mutually agreed upon time.

    to our online portals. We make no representations, warranties, or
    covenants as to whether these modifications or this software will
    disrupt the normal operations of the Services or your Customer
    Equipment, including causing the loss of files. FOR THESE AND OTHER
    REASONS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BACKING UP ALL
    FILES TO ANOTHER STORAGE MECHANISM. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS

    <p>
    <strong>Our liability for disruption of Services is limited. </strong>The Services are not fail-safe, and are not designed or intended for
    use in situations that qualify as &ldquo;<strong>High Risk Activities</strong>.&rdquo; High Risk Activities include activities requiring fail-safe
    performance, or where an error or interruption in the Services could
    lead to severe injury to businesses, persons, property, or the

    information is required. You expressly assume the risk of any damages
    resulting from use of the Services in connection with High Risk
    Activities.

    <p>
    We will not be liable for any inconvenience, loss, liability, or damage
    resulting from any interruption of the Services, directly or indirectly
    caused by, or proximately resulting from, any circumstances beyond our
    immediate control, including (but not limited to) the following: (a)
    causes attributable to you, your Customer Equipment, your Premises, your
    property, or third parties, including our inability to access your

    <p>
    In all other cases of an interruption of the Services, you may request a
    pro rata credit for any Service interruption exceeding twenty-four (24)
    consecutive hours after the interruption is reported to us (or another
    period of time provided by law). You must request a pro rata credit
    within 120 days of the Service interruption. Unless required by law,
    your pro rata credit will not exceed your fixed monthly charges for the
    Services that month. Your pro rata credit will exclude all nonrecurring
    charges, one-time charges, per-call or measured charges, regulatory
    fees, and surcharges, taxes, and other governmental and
    quasi-governmental fees.
    <strong>EXCEPT AND UNLESS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED BY LAW, A CREDIT WILL BE

    <h3><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION, AND CLASS/COLLECTIVE/REPRESENTATIVE
    ACTION/RELIEF WAIVER</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Any Dispute involving you and us shall be resolved through individual
    arbitration as described in this Section 13 (the &ldquo;<strong>Arbitration Provision</strong>&rdquo;). In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, and there is less
    discovery and appellate review than in court.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Definitions. </strong>This Arbitration Provision shall be
    interpreted broadly. &ldquo;<strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo; means any
    and all claims or controversies related to us or our relationship,
    including, but not limited to, any and all: (1) claims for relief and
    theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud,
    negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims or
    controversies that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement;
    (3) claims or controversies that arise after the expiration or
    termination of this Agreement; and (4) claims or controversies that are
    the subject of purported class, collective, or representative action
    litigation. As used in this Arbitration Provision,
    &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo;
    means Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and any of its parents,
    subsidiaries, and other affiliates, each of their respective
    predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of their respective
    officers, directors, employees, and agents; and
    &ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo; means you and any users or
    beneficiaries of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Exclusions. </strong>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE
    FOLLOWING DISPUTES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION: (i) DISPUTES
    RELATING TO THE SCOPE, VALIDITY, OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION
    PROVISION; (ii) DISPUTES THAT ARISE BETWEEN US AND ANY STATE OR LOCAL
    REGULATORY AUTHORITY OR AGENCY THAT IS EMPOWERED BY FEDERAL, STATE, OR
    LOCAL LAW TO GRANT A FRANCHISE UNDER 47 U.S.C. &sect; 522(9); AND (iii)
    DISPUTES THAT CAN ONLY BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE LOCAL FRANCHISE AUTHORITY
    UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FRANCHISE.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Right to Opt Out. </strong>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ARBITRATE
    DISPUTES, YOU MAY DECLINE TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTES WITH US ARBITRATED BY
    NOTIFYING US, WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST SERVICE ACTIVATION, (i) BY
    VISITING <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WWW.XFINITY.COM/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT</a>, OR (ii) IN WRITING BY

    DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS
    ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP
    WITH US OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY US. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY OPTED OUT
    OF ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCOUNT GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
    YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN. BUT YOU MUST SEPARATELY OPT OUT FOR EACH
    ACCOUNT UNDER WHICH YOU RECEIVE SERVICES. ANY OPT-OUTS SUBMITTED AFTER
    THIS 30-DAY PERIOD WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE AND ALL DISPUTES WITH US WILL
    BE ARBITRATED.

    <p>
    <strong>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. </strong>Either you or we may initiate an arbitration proceeding by opening a
    case with the American Arbitration Association
    (&ldquo;<strong>AAA</strong>&rdquo;) by visiting its website
    (<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>) or calling its toll free number (1-800-778-7879).
    You may deliver any required or desired notice to us by mail to:
    Comcast, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838
    &ndash; ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Right to Sue in Small Claims Court. </strong>Notwithstanding
    anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or we
    may elect to have a Dispute heard in a small claims court in the area
    where you receive(d) Services from us, if the claim(s) underlying the
    Dispute is not aggregated with the claim(s) of any other person and if
    the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the
    small claims court.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Arbitration Procedures. </strong>Any arbitration under this
    Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
    Arbitrations shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to the most
    recent version of its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&rdquo;) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that
    is in effect when you notify us about your Dispute. You can obtain the
    AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>) or
    calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). If there is a conflict
    between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this
    Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this
    Arbitration Provision and the AAA Rules, this Arbitration Provision
    shall govern. If the AAA will not administer a proceeding under this
    Arbitration Provision as written, you and we shall agree on a substitute
    arbitration organization. If you and we cannot agree, you and we shall
    mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an
    arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this
    Arbitration Provision, as written, applying the AAA Rules. A single
    arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and we agree otherwise,
    any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you
    in the area where you receive Services from us. If you no longer receive
    Services from us when you notify us of your Dispute, then any
    arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in
    the county where you reside when you notify us of your Dispute, provided
    that we offer Services in that county, or in the area where you received
    Services from us at the time of the events giving rise to your Dispute.
    The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will
    take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other
    confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a
    reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator&rsquo;s essential
    findings and conclusions. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award may be entered in
    any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for
    purposes of enforcing the arbitrator&rsquo;s award. An
    arbitrator&rsquo;s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be
    entered in any court.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Waiver of Class, Collective, and Representative Actions/Relief. </strong>THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR
    LITIGATED (I) ON A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR OTHER JOINT OR
    CONSOLIDATED BASIS, OR (II) ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A
    PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH
    AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE
    ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
    SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
    WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY&rsquo;S CLAIM, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY
    NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A
    PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S
    CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS,
    COLLECTIVE, OTHER JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
    THIS WAIVER OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OTHER JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED, OR
    REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
    ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING
    PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS
    ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT
    JURISDICTION.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Arbitral Fees and Costs. </strong>If your claim seeks more than
    $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA&rsquo;s fees and costs
    will be governed by the AAA Rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000
    in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA&rsquo;s fees and costs will be
    our responsibility. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute
    was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
    standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the
    payment of the AAA&rsquo;s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA
    Rules, and you shall reimburse us for all fees and costs that were your
    obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may hire an attorney to
    represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your
    attorneys&rsquo; fees and additional costs. You may only recover your
    attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in the arbitration if the arbitration is
    decided in your favor and to the extent that you could have recovered
    those fees in court in accordance with the law or statute(s) that apply
    to the case. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to
    the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law
    to pay.

    <strong>Survival. </strong>This Arbitration Provision shall survive the
    termination of your Services with us.

    <h3><strong> RETENTION OF RIGHTS</strong></h3>
    <p>
    We may decide not to enforce our rights or exercise a remedy under this
