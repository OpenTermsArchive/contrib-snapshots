However, nonmembers will not have the opportunity to access certain enhanced content and application areas, win our seasonal promotions, experience future personalization, and voice their questions and concerns as quickly.
When you register with Family Education Network, you provide personal information.
Family Education Network uses this information to better create and organize our content programming to meet your needs.
</p>
<p>The personally identifiable information we may request from you, and with which we identify you as a member, includes the following: first name, last name, email address, gender, date of birth, ZIP code, username, and password.

When you conduct a transaction through this site, you are providing transaction information to Family Education Network's third party suppliers (such as transaction processors and financial institutions) who will use the information solely for the purpose of the transaction.
Finally, there may also be other third party vendors who supply software applications, web hosting and other technologies for this site that may have access to your personal information but they will never use such information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this site.

<p>We Protect Kids' Privacy: <br>Family Education Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without permission when using the Internet.
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children.
</p>
<p>As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family's privacy on the Internet.
We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe.
In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are a few exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent"): </p>
<ol>
<li>We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Family Education Network or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services within Family Education Network that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will NOT knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13.
Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will NOT knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13.
These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Upon request, Family Education Network will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site.
Family Education Network only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in the program or service.</li>
</ol> If you have any questions about our Kids' Privacy Policy, please call Family Education Network at: 1-800-498-3264.
<p>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent: <br>Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating.
Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child's participation in the activity.
For every child (anyone under 13 years of age) we require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as an email, mail-in letter, fax, or toll-free phone call to Family Education Network.
</p>
<p>Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent:
<br>
There are few instances where we will NOT get verifiable parental consent, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular study question).
We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding).
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription).
In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child.
The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe).
We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.</li>
