Terms of Service <p>Thank you for using Bitcasa! These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of Bitcasa (“we” or “our”) websites and services (the “Services”), so please carefully read them before using the Services.
By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms.
In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p>
<p>You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms.
You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with Bitcasa and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.
The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features.
We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you.
We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.
</p>
Your Stuff &amp.
Your Privacy <p>By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Bitcasa (together, “your stuff”).
You retain full ownership to your stuff.
We don’t claim any ownership to any of it.
These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.</p>
<p>We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your data, or =sharing it at your direction.
This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews.
It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe.
You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services.
This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).</p>
<p>To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your content with others, including law enforcement, for any purpose unless you direct us to.
How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services.
For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.</p>
<p>We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Bitcasa has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.
</p>
Sending Your Stuff <p>The Services provide features that allow you to send your stuff to others or to make it public.
There are many things that users may do with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-send it).
Please consider carefully what you choose to share or make public.
Bitcasa has no responsibility for that activity.
</p>
Your Responsibilities <p>Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights of others.
Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the right to do so.
You, not Bitcasa, will be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload, download or otherwise use while using the Services.
You must not upload spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.</p>
<p>You, and not Bitcasa, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your stuff.
Bitcasa will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your stuff.</p>
<p>If your contact information, or other information related to your account, changes, you must notify us promptly and keep your information current.
The Services are not intended for use by you if you are under 13 years of age.
By agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over 13.
</p>
Account Security <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party.
You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity.
You should immediately notify Bitcasa of any unauthorized use of your account.
You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data to Bitcasa, it is your responsibility to use a secure connection to communicate with the Services.
</p>
Software and Updates <p>Some use of our Service requires you to download a client software package (“Software”).
Bitcasa hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services.
Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms in a manner that implicates our intellectual property rights.
We hereby reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

Our Services may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available.
</p>
Bitcasa Property and Feedback <p>These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software, or the content in the Services.
While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post in our forums without any obligation to you.
The Software and other technology we use to provide the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.
These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the Bitcasa trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features.

Bitcasa does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content, products, or services.
You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources.
Also, if we provide you with any software under an open source license, there may be provisions in those licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, in which case the open source provisions will apply.
</p>
Termination <p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any time.
We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.
For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services.
If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.
</p>
Bitcasa is Available “AS-IS” <p>Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we can’t promise.
The services and software are provided “as is”, at your own risk, without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind.
We also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
</p>
<p>Bitcasa will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software.
Some states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>
Limitation of Liability <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Bitcasa, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for (a) an indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Bitcasa has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.
(b) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services more than the greater or $20 or the amounts paid by you to Bitcasa for the past three months of the services in question.
Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>
Modifications <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website.
If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account).
Other changes may be posted to our blog or terms page, so please check those pages regularly.
By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.
</p>
Miscellaneous Legal Terms <p>These Terms and the use of the services and software will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services or software must be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara county, California, and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Bitcasa with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
Bitcasa’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Bitcasa may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
Bitcasa and you are not legal partners or agents.
instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.</p>
