These Terms of Service (the âTermsâ) govern your access to and use of Bitcasa (âweâ or âourâ) websites and services (the âServicesâ), so please carefully read them before using the Services.
By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms.
In that case, âyouâ and âyourâ will refer to that organization.
You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms.
You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with Bitcasa and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.
The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features.
We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you.
We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.
Your Stuff &amp; Your Privacy By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Bitcasa (together, âyour stuffâ).
You retain full ownership to your stuff.
We donât claim any ownership to any of it.
These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.
We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your data, or =sharing it at your direction.
This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews.
It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe.
You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services.
This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).
To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we wonât share your content with others, including law enforcement, for any purpose unless you direct us to.
How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.
You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services.
For example, itâs your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.
We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Bitcasa has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.
Sending Your Stuff The Services provide features that allow you to send your stuff to others or to make it public.
There are many things that users may do with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-send it).
Please consider carefully what you choose to share or make public.
Bitcasa has no responsibility for that activity.
Your Responsibilities Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights of others.
Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the right to do so.
You, not Bitcasa, will be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload, download or otherwise use while using the Services.
You must not upload spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.
You, and not Bitcasa, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your stuff.
Bitcasa will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your stuff.
If your contact information, or other information related to your account, changes, you must notify us promptly and keep your information current.
The Services are not intended for use by you if you are under 13 years of age.
By agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over 13.
Account Security You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party.
You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity.
You should immediately notify Bitcasa of any unauthorized use of your account.
You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data to Bitcasa, it is your responsibility to use a secure connection to communicate with the Services.
Software and Updates Some use of our Service requires you to download a client software package (âSoftwareâ).
Bitcasa hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services.
Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms in a manner that implicates our intellectual property rights.
We hereby reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.
You must not reverse engineer or decompile the Software, nor attempt to do so, nor assist anyone else to do so.
Our Services may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available.
Bitcasa Property and Feedback These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software, or the content in the Services.
While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post in our forums without any obligation to you.
The Software and other technology we use to provide the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.
These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the Bitcasa trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features.
Acceptable Use You will not, and will not attempt to, misuse the Services, and will use the Services only in a manner consistent with the Bitcasa Acceptable Use Policy.
Copyright Bitcasa respects othersâ intellectual property and asks that you do too.
We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law and are properly provided to us.
Such notices should be reported using our DMCA Process.
We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and to terminate repeat infringers.
Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is: Copyright Agent Bitcasa, Inc.
274 Castro St #204 Mountain View, CA 94041 copyright@bitcasa.
com Other Content The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources.
Bitcasa does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content, products, or services.
You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources.
Also, if we provide you with any software under an open source license, there may be provisions in those licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, in which case the open source provisions will apply.
Termination Though weâd much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any time.
We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.
For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt othersâ use of the Services.
If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.
Bitcasa is Available âAS-ISâ Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we canât promise.
The services and software are provided âas isâ, at your own risk, without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind.
We also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
Bitcasa will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software.
Some states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
Limitation of Liability To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Bitcasa, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for (a) an indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Bitcasa has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services more than the greater or $20 or the amounts paid by you to Bitcasa for the past three months of the services in question.
Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
Modifications We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website.
If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account).
Other changes may be posted to our blog or terms page, so please check those pages regularly.
By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.
Miscellaneous Legal Terms These Terms and the use of the services and software will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services or software must be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara county, California, and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Bitcasa with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
Bitcasaâs failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Bitcasa may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
Bitcasa and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.

All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as âinformation.

When you invite others to join Bitcasa by using our referral page, we send them a one-time email for that referral.
You may also provide us with your contactsâ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them.
We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Bitcasa to you.

We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Bitcasa Service (âFilesâ).
If you add a file to your Bitcasa that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.

When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services.
This may include the Deviceâs Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.
Cookies.
We also use âcookiesâ to collect information and improve our Services.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device.
We may use âpersistent cookiesâ to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service.
We may use âsession ID cookiesâ to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.

If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them.
If you donât want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature.

com Pricing &amp; Refund Policy Bitcasa is currently free to use during an initial trial period.
Premium Accounts (coming soon) Bitcasa offers you the option of increasing your account storage space beyond [TBD]GB either by inviting friends or for a fee.
When you choose to increase available storage by paying a fee, your account will be converted to a Premium Account and will not be subject to some of the restrictions placed on Free Accounts as described below.
Bitcasa accepts credit cards and will automatically charge your credit card monthly or yearly, depending upon which Premium Account you select.
For credit cards denominated in a supported currency other than U.
S.
dollars (USD), your bank or credit card company may charge foreign conversion fees.
If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Bitcasa is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Bitcasa reserves the right to revoke access to your Bitcasa account and Files.
If you do not bring your Bitcasa balance current within five (5) days after Bitcasa provides you with notification that your account is in arrears, Bitcasa reserves the right to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your Files so as to reduce your storage space to within the allowed limit, and to convert your Bitcasa Premium Account to a Free Account (which is subject to the restrictions described below).
Billing The fees for your Premium Account will be billed from the date you elect, or convert to, a Premium Account and on each monthly or yearly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your account.
Click on the link on your "Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period.
Bitcasa will automatically bill your credit card each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Premium Account.
In the event your Premium Account began on a day not contained in a given month or year, Bitcasa will bill your credit card on the last day of such month or year.
For example, if your Premium Account began on January 31st, February 28th is the next time your credit card would be billed.
You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary for reasons that include, differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax, and you authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts.
Bitcasa may also periodically authorize your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges.
All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
Should you elect to upgrade to a different Premium Account, the commencement date for your next renewal period will be reset and you will be billed for the first month or year of the upgraded level of service on a pro-rata basis.
For example, if you begin your monthly billed Premium Account on February 15th, your next payment would be due on March 15th.
On March 22, you upgrade your Premium Account to a different Premium Account and pay the new amount associated with the upgraded Premium Account you have selected, less the amount equal to 7 days at your previous Premium Account rate.
Your next payment would then be due on April 22.
Bitcasa may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email.
If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your "Account" page.
If your credit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Bitcasa constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.
Cancelling Your Account Your Bitcasa Premium Account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your Premium Account or we terminate it.
You must cancel your Premium Account before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's fees to your credit card.
Bitcasa will bill the monthly or yearly fees associated with your Premium Account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your account information).
Refunds Bitcasa Premium Accounts are prepaid and are non-refundable.
Bitcasa DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL MONTHS OR YEARS.
You may cancel your Bitcasa Premium Account at anytime, and cancellation will be effective immediately.
If you wish to cancel your Premium Account you may do so via your "Account" page.
Should you elect to cancel your Premium Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly fees.
By signing up for a Bitcasa Premium Account and providing Bitcasa with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.
Free Accounts Bitcasa allows you to store up to [TBD]GB free of charge and allows you to increase your storage capacity for free by inviting your friends.
For every friend who installs and registers with Bitcasa, both you and your friend get an extra [TBD]GB for life.
Bitcasa reserves the right to terminate Free Accounts at any time, with or without notice.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Free Account is inactive for ninety (90) days, then Bitcasa may delete any or all of Your Files without providing additional notice.
Security Overview We provide this overview so that you can better understand the security measures weâve put in place to protect the information that you store using Bitcasa.
Secure Storage We encrypt the data that you store on Bitcasa using AES-256, which is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure customer data.
Data is encrypted on the desktop client before it is uploaded.
For mobile clients, data may be encrypted on the server instead of the client.
Bitcasa uses Amazon S3 for data storage.
Amazon stores data over several large-scale data centers.
According to Amazon, they use military grade perimeter control berms, video surveillance, and professional security staff to keep their data centers physically secure.
You can find more information about Amazon's security at the Amazon Web Services' website.
Amazon and Bitcasa also employ significant protection against network security issues such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, and packet sniffing.
Secure Transfers Your files are sent between Bitcasaâs desktop clients and our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, the standard for secure Internet network connections.
Your files are sent between Bitcasaâs mobile apps and our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL encryption where supported.
Not all mobile media players support encrypted streaming, so media files streamed from our servers are not always encrypted.
Your Data is Backed Up Bitcasa and Amazon keep redundant backups of all data over multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss.
In the unlikely event that this redundancy were to fail, folders that you have chosen to Sync using Bitcasa will still contain copies of your files.
Privacy We guard your privacy to the best of our ability and work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access.
Bitcasa employees cannot view the content of the files you store in your Bitcasa account.
In addition, we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.
Third-party Apps If you choose to access Bitcasa using third-party applications (âappsâ), be aware that those apps utilize their own security protocols and have their own privacy policies.
If youâre not comfortable with the privacy and security features of those apps, you shouldnât use them to access Bitcasa.
For example, third-party apps might not employ encryption when transmitting data, might collect information that Bitcasa does not, and might use information differently than Bitcasa does.
How to Add Your Own Layer of Encryption to Bitcasa Bitcasa applies encryption to your files on the desktop before they have been uploaded.
Users who wish to manage their own encryption keys can apply encryption before storing their files on Bitcasa.
Please note that if you encrypt files before uploading them, some features will not be available, such as creating public links.
Doing so will also make it impossible for us to recover your data if you lose your encryption key.
I think I've found a security exploit.
Where do I report security concerns? We take a number of measures to ensure that the data you store on Bitcasa is safe and secure.
While we're very confident in our technology, we recognize that no system can guarantee data security with 100% certainty.
For that reason, we will continue to innovate to make sure that our security measures are state of the art, and we will investigate any and all reported security issues concerning Bitcasa's services or software.
For a direct line to our security experts, report security issues to security@bitcasa.
com.
We'll fully credit anybody whose reports lead to the improvement of Bitcasa security.
A list of those who have contributed reports leading to a bug or security issue can be found on our special thanks page.
Acceptable Use Bitcasa is proud of the trust you place in us to store your valuable data.
In exchange, we trust you to use our services responsibly.
Each Bitcasa account is for personal use only, and use of a single Bitcasa account by any corporation or small business entity is prohibited.
You agree not to misuse the Bitcasa services.
For example, you must not, and must not attempt to, use the services to do the following things.
probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network; breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures; access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service, shared areas of the Service you have not been invited to, Bitcasa (or our service providersâ) computer systems; interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of the Services; plant malware or otherwise use the Services to distribute malware;
