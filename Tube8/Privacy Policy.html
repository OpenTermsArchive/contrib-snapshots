These Terms of Service apply to the Website, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network "tabs", or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.
</p>
<p> Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website.
By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at https://www.tube8.com/info.html#privacy , incorporated herein by reference.
If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.
</p>
<p> If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service.
If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.
</p>
<p> You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form.
</p>
<p> When using the Website, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies.
Such rules, guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
We may also offer other websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.
</p> Ability to Accept Terms of Service <p> You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Website.
You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.
</p> Changes to the Terms of Service <p> We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at https://www.tube8.com/info.html#terms , so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms.

<li> The VIT ID and password will act as ‘keys’ for connecting on the VIT Platform, and will be different and independent from the Tube8 registered user account.
<strong>
<em> Avoid using any real names, address or any identifier as VIT ID.
</em>
</strong> Tokken is an independent third party which complete terms and conditions are found at: https://visionindustry.com/disclaimer .
</li>
<li> ***<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>***: Please take good note and make sure to remember your VIT ID and your password – they are the ‘keys’ to access your VIT Account, your VIT and your VIT Wallet (as described herein).
If you lost or do not remember your password, please contact Tokken directly at info@visionindustry.com.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<strong>Connect.</strong> Each VIT User, once registered, can connect through the Website in order to submit content, interact with other content or to access its personal wallet page (the “<strong>VIT Wallet</strong>”).
A VIT User may also connect directly through Tokken’s website, https://visionindustry.com/, to access and to use its VIT Wallet.
</li>
<ul>
<li>VIT Wallet Terms: </li>
<ul>
<li> The VIT Wallet is provided to all VIT Users on an as-is, self-serve basis.
No custody service of any digital assets is provided by Tube8 or any of its related or affiliated entities.
</li>
<li> VIT Users are at all times required to conduct themselves diligently and prudently in safeguarding their VIT Account and its associated information, including any passwords, private keys, security question answers, and/or PIN codes.
</li>
<li> As diligent and prudent VIT Users, VIT Users are strongly recommended to familiarize themselves with the functionality of the VIT Wallet, namely by reading any provided or associated documentation and/or start with “test” transactions of small amounts.
</li>
<li> VIT Users hereby acknowledge that Tube8 has no method of recovering such associated information in the event that such information is lost, misplaced, forgotten, or otherwise caused to be unavailable to any user.
VIT Users hereby recognizes that Tube8 doesn’t control the VIT Platform and shall incur no responsibility whatsoever in the event of any loss (whether such loss is of material value, opportunity value, or of any other nature) resulting from misuse or malfunction of the VIT Wallet.
</li>
<li> Moreover, each VIT User personally assumes the risk of total or partial loss of digital assets stored on the VIT Wallet (with possible risks existing due to factors that are both inside and outside of the VIT User’s control) and as such, VIT Users agree to take the appropriate precautions in their use of the VIT Wallet, in accordance with their knowledge and expertise with cryptocurrency assets (and their associated storage methods), the VIT User’s won risk tolerance, and any other relevant factors.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
<strong>Interact.</strong> Each VIT User will be able to interact (liking and/or commenting, each an “<strong>Interaction</strong>”) with all VIT Content or other VIT User’s comments.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Power.</strong> Each Interaction will use a VIT User-selected amount of “ <strong>Power</strong>” – ranging from 10% to 100% of the daily available Power, therefore limiting the amount of Interactions each VIT User can use each day.
The more Power is used on a single Interaction, the bigger the potential reward could be.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Get Rewarded.
</strong> Each Interaction from a VIT User with any VIT Content will be rewarded with VIT to the interacting VIT User, depending on various aspects, notably: </li>
<ul>
<li> The Power each VIT User used.
and </li>
<li> The popularity of VIT User’s Interactions (for example: many ‘likes’ and comments on a VIT User’s comment or videos).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enjoy.</strong> All earned VIT will be accessible via each VIT User’s VIT Wallet.
VIT can be spent to: </li>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Increase VIT User’s Power – </strong>Allowing more daily Interactions.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transfer VIT – </strong>Allowing free transfer of VIT between VIT Users.
</li>
<li>
<strong>And More – </strong>More information on uses, withdrawing or trading VIT with other cryptocurrencies are available directly on Tokken‘s website at https://visionindustry.com/.
Additionally, you can also email Tokken directly at info@visionindustry.com for more information.
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Withdrawing VIT</strong> – In order to exchange VIT for other currencies, you first need to transfer your VIT from your VIT Wallet to an exchange or trading platform that supports VIT, such as IDAX (https://www.idax.pro) or Cryptopia (https://cryptopia.co.nz/).
To do so, sign up for an account on such an exchange, and locate your deposit address for VIT.
In your VIT Wallet, transfer any desired and available amount of VIT to that deposit address.
Once this transfer is complete, your VIT balance should show up in your deposit address account, which will give you the ability to trade your VIT for any currency supported by your exchange or trading platform.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tips.
</strong> To maximize the VIT rewards, try to create valuable/positive Interactions with other VIT Users.

Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to https://www.tube8.com/ ("<strong>Tube8</strong>"), or all of the foregoing.</p>
