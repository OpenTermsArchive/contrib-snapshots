Without limiting the foregoing, if for any reason you are unable to comply with such principles or your Privacy Shield certification should end, you will immediately notify Twitter and take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any non-compliance, or cease access to the Twitter API and use of any and all TIC Data.
If a transfer of TIC Data by you is not covered by Privacy Shield, and then only if you are located or transfer such TIC Data out of (a) the European Economic Area, or (b) a jurisdiction where a European Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC is in force and covers such transfer, then use of such TIC Data is subject to the model contractual clauses annexed to Commission Decision 2004/915/EC (the “<strong>Clauses</strong>”), which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

For the purposes of Annex B to the Clauses, the following shall apply: (i) ‘Data subjects’ are the users of the Twitter Services or individuals whose personal data is in the TIC Data.
(ii) the ‘Purpose of the transfer(s)’ is the performance of this Agreement and the provision of services by you to End Users.

<strong>Compliance Audit.</strong>Twitter, or a third party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality, shall be entitled to inspect and audit any records or activity related to your access to the Licensed Material for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement.

You will provide your full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to all Licensed Material in your possession or control, applicable agreements and records.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, Twitter may request, and you agree to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing your then-current deployment of the Licensed Material and Twitter Content.
The rights and requirements of this section will survive for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement.</li>

Government (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Northern Sudan and Syria).
or to any restricted or denied end-user including, but not limited to, any person or entity prohibited by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
or for any restricted end-use.
You will maintain all rights and licenses that are required with respect to your Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Warranty Disclaimer.</strong> THE LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS”, “WHERE IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
TWITTER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED MATERIAL OR ANY OTHER TWITTER PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL MEET ANY OF YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT USE OF SUCH LICENSED MATERIAL OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, VIRUS-FREE OR SECURE.

<li>
<strong>Indemnification.</strong> You shall defend Twitter against any and all actions, demands, claims and suits (including without limitation product liability claims), and indemnify and hold Twitter harmless from any and all liabilities, damages and costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent arising out of: (i) your use of the Licensed Material in any manner that is inconsistent with this Agreement.
or (ii) the performance, promotion, sale or distribution of your Services.
In the event Twitter seeks indemnification or defense from you under this provision, Twitter will promptly notify you in writing of the claim(s) brought against Twitter for which it seeks indemnification or defense.
Twitter reserves the right, at its option and sole discretion, to assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice.
You may not enter into any third party agreement, which would, in any manner whatsoever, affect the rights of Twitter, constitute an admission of fault by Twitter or bind Twitter in any manner, without the prior written consent of Twitter.
In the event Twitter assumes control of the defense of such claim, Twitter shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.</li>
<li>
<strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT WILL TWITTER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY END USERS FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO USE, DATA, BUSINESS, GOODWILL OR PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
IN ANY CASE, TWITTER'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $50.00 USD.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.
INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE AGREED ALLOCATIONS OF RISK AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.</li>
<li>
<strong>Updates.</strong> Twitter may update or modify this Agreement, Developer Terms, and other terms and conditions, from time to time at its sole discretion by posting the changes on this site or by otherwise notifying you (such notice may be via email).
You acknowledge that these updates and modifications may adversely affect how your Service accesses or communicates with the Twitter API.
If any change is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease all use of the Licensed Material.
Your continued access or use of the Licensed Material will constitute binding acceptance of the such updates and modifications.</li>
<li>
<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes and merges all prior proposals, understandings and contemporaneous communications.
Any modification to this Agreement must be in a writing signed by both you and Twitter, Inc.
You may not assign any of the rights or obligations granted hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether you are the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, except with the prior written consent of Twitter, Inc.
Twitter, Inc.
is authorized to sign modifications and consents on behalf of Twitter International Company, an Irish company responsible for the information of Twitter users who live outside the United States.

This Agreement does not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles.
Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, CA before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
You and Twitter hereby expressly waive trial by jury.
As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules.
You may bring claims only on your own behalf, and unless Twitter agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.
Despite the foregoing, you agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for Twitter in the event of a breach or threatened breach of a provision of this Agreement protecting Twitter's intellectual property or Confidential Information, and that in the event of such a breach or threat, Twitter, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled, is entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting Company from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate.
The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) shall apply to this Agreement, regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated.
No waiver by Twitter of any covenant or right under this Agreement will be effective unless memorialized in a writing duly authorized by Twitter.
