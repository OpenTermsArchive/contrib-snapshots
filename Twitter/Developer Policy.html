<strong>I.
Guiding Principles</strong>¶ A.
A Few Key Points¶ <ol>
<li>Keep any API keys or other access credentials private and use only as permitted.</li>
<li>Respect our requirements on how to display and interact with users’ content.</li>
<li>If your application will need more than 1 million user tokens, you must contact us about your Twitter API access, as you may be subject to additional terms.
</li>
<li>Twitter may monitor your use of the Twitter API to improve the Twitter Services, examine commercial use and ensure your compliance with this Policy.</li>
<li>Remember, Twitter may suspend or revoke access to the Twitter API if we believe you are in violation of this Policy.
Do not apply for or register additional API tokens if Twitter has suspended your account.
Instead, contact us.
</li>
</ol> B.
Maintain the Integrity of Twitter’s Products¶ <ol>
<li>Follow the Display Requirements, Twitter Rules and Periscope Community Guidelines.
If your Service facilitates or induces users to violate the Twitter Rules or Periscope Community Guidelines, you must figure out how to prevent the abuse or Twitter may suspend or terminate your access to the Twitter API.
We’ve provided guidance in our Abuse Prevention and Security help page.
</li>
<li>If your Service submits content to Twitter that includes a Twitter username, submit the correct Twitter username (“@username”).</li>
<li>Do not modify, translate or delete a portion of the Twitter Content.</li>
<li>Maintain the features and functionality of Twitter Content and Twitter API.
Do not interfere with, intercept, disrupt, filter, or disable any features of Twitter or the Twitter API, including the Twitter Content of embedded Tweets and embedded timelines.
</li>
<li>Do not exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls, sharing, privacy settings, or use permitted in this Policy, or as otherwise set forth on the Developer Site, or communicated to you by Twitter.
</li>
<li>Do not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on Twitter Content or the Twitter API.</li>
<li>Do not (and do not allow others to) aggregate, cache, or store location data and other geographic information contained in the Twitter Content, except as part of a Tweet or Periscope Broadcast.
Any use of location data or geographic information on a standalone basis is prohibited.</li>
</ol> C.
Respect Users’ Control and Privacy¶ <ol>
<li>Get the user’s express consent before you do any of the following: <ol>
<li>Take any actions on a user’s behalf, including posting Twitter Content, following/unfollowing other users, modifying profile information, starting a Periscope Broadcast or adding hashtags or other data to the user's Tweets.
A user authenticating through your Service does not constitute user consent.</li>
<li>Republish Twitter Content accessed by means other than via the Twitter API or other Twitter tools.</li>
<li>Use a user’s Twitter Content to promote a commercial product or service, either on a commercial durable good or as part of an advertisement.</li>
<li>Store non-public Twitter Content such as Direct Messages or other private or confidential information.</li>
<li>Share or publish protected Twitter Content, private or confidential information.</li>
<li>Configure media to be sent in a Direct Message as "shared" (i.e.
reusable across multiple Direct Messages).
You must also provide the user with clear notice that "shared" media sent in a Direct Message will be viewable by anyone with the media's URL.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not (and do not permit others to) associate the Twitter Content with any person, household, device, browser, or other individual identifier, unless you or the entity on whose sole behalf you make such an association do so (a) with the express opt-in consent of the applicable individual.
or (b) based solely on publicly available data and/or data provided directly by the applicable individual that the individual would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose.</li>
<li>If Twitter Content is deleted, gains protected status, or is otherwise suspended, withheld, modified, or removed from the Twitter Service (including removal of location information), you will make all reasonable efforts to delete or modify such Twitter Content (as applicable) as soon as reasonably possible, and in any case within 24 hours after a request to do so by Twitter or by a Twitter user with regard to their Twitter Content, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or regulation, and with the express written permission of Twitter.</li>
<li>If your Service will display Twitter Content to the public or to end users of your Service, and you do not use Twitter Kit or Twitter for Websites to do so, then you must use the Twitter API to retrieve the most current version of the Twitter Content for such display.
If Twitter Content ceases to be available through the Twitter API, you may not display such Twitter Content and must remove it from non-display portions of your Service as soon as reasonably possible.
</li>
<li>If your Service allows users to post Twitter Content to Twitter, then, before publishing, show the user exactly what will be published, including whether any geotags will be added to the Twitter Content.
If you will send read receipt events for Direct Messages, you should inform users they will be sent as part of a conversation, such as by directly providing this notice to users in your application or by displaying read receipts from other participants in a conversation.</li>
<li>If your Service allows users to post Twitter Content to your Service and Twitter, then, before publishing to the Service: <ol>
<li>Explain how you will use the Twitter Content;</li>
<li>Obtain proper permission to use the Twitter Content.
and</li>
<li>Continue to use such Twitter Content in accordance with this Policy in connection with the Twitter Content.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Display your Service’s privacy policy to users before download, installation or sign up of your application.
Your privacy policy must be consistent with all applicable laws, and be no less protective of end users than Twitter’s Privacy Policy located at https://twitter.com/privacy including any relevant incorporated policies such as the supplemental terms located at https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172501.
You must comply with your privacy policy, which must clearly disclose the information you collect from users, how you use and share that information (including with Twitter), and how users can contact you with inquiries and requests regarding their information.
If for any reason you are unable to comply with your privacy policy or any privacy requirement of the Developer Agreement or Policy, you must promptly inform Twitter and take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any non-compliance, or cease your access to the Twitter API and use of all Twitter Content.
</li>
<li>If your Service uses cookies, disclose in your privacy policy: <ol>
<li>Whether third parties collect user information on your Service and across other websites or online services;</li>
<li>Information about user options for cookie management and whether you honor the Do Not Track setting in supporting web browsers.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If your Service adds location information to users’ Tweets or Periscope Broadcasts: <ol>
<li>Disclose when you add location information, whether as a geotag or annotations data, and whether you add a place or specific coordinates.</li>
<li>Comply with Geo Developers Guidelines if your application allows users to Tweet with their location.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not store Twitter passwords.</li>
</ol> D.

<ol>

<li>You may not distribute Tweet IDs for the purposes of (a) enabling any entity to store and analyze Tweets for a period exceeding 30 days unless you are doing so on behalf of an academic institution and for the sole purpose of non-commercial research or you have received the express written permission of Twitter, or (b) enabling any entity to circumvent any other limitations or restrictions on the distribution of Twitter Content as contained in this Policy, the Twitter Developer Agreement, or any other agreement with Twitter.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</li>
</ol> G.
Avoid Replicating the Core Twitter Experience¶ <ol>

<li>The following rules apply solely to Services or applications that attempt to replicate Twitter’s core user experience: <ol>
<li>You must obtain our permission to have more than 100,000 user tokens, and you may be subject to additional terms.</li>
