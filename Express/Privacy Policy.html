<br> When you visit Express through its websites, pages on social media websites or through one of our mobile applications, we collect certain information to enhance your online experience.  To make it easier for you to understand what Express collects and uses through its various online channels, we have combined several privacy policies to provide this summary.  As a result of this combination, you will notice two sections that were not in our prior www.express.com privacy policy that address location information collected through our mobile applications and what happens on pages that Express has on social media sites.  While offered before, for ease of reference, we have gathered your choices on how your information is disclosed into one section.<br>
<br> The online channels covered by this privacy policy include (1) www.express.com, m.express.com or any other Express website which links to this policy (our "Websites"), (2) Express pages on social media sites, such as Facebook (including the Express Shop on Facebook), Twitter and YouTube ("Social Media Pages"), and (3) mobile applications available for various smartphones provided by Express ("Mobile Applications").  The term "Online Channels" is used in this policy to refer to all of these channels.  If a statement is only applicable to a specific Website, channel or channels, we will so specify.
This policy also explains how Express uses and discloses information it collects through its Online Channels.  Your use of the Websites, purchase through one of the Websites or purchase through an Express Social Media Page signifies acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy.<br>
