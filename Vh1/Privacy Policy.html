There currently is disagreement, including amongparticipants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites shoulddo when they receive such signals.</p>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established andaccepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
