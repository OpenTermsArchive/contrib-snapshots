A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server.
We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture or Google), that collect information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile applications.
The information we may collect by automated means includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;URLs that refer visitors to our sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dates and times of visits to our sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information on actions taken on our sites (such as page views and site navigation patterns)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our websites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search terms that visitors use to reach our sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-we-use-the-information-we-collect"&gt;How We Use the Information We Collect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may use the information we obtain about you to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Register you for membership at our websites, and manage and maintain your account on the sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide products or services you request&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Process, validate, confirm, verify, deliver and track your purchases (including by processing payment card transactions, arranging shipping and handling returns and refunds, and contacting you about your orders, including by telephone)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a record of the purchases you make on our sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respond to your questions and comments and provide customer support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicate with you about our products, services, offers, events and promotions, and offer you products and services we believe may be of interest to you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable you to communicate with us through our blogs, social networks and other interactive media&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish your testimonials about GILT, including on our websites and blogs, and on social networks (if we choose to publish your testimonial, we will include only your first name, last initial, city and state)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage your participation in our events, sweepstakes and other promotions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests and the manner in which visitors use our sites, applications and social media assets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operate, evaluate and improve our business and the products and services we offer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyze and enhance our marketing communications and strategies (including by identifying when emails sent to you have been received and read)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyze trends and statistics regarding visitors’ use of our sites, mobile applications and social media assets, and the purchases visitors make on our sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect against and prevent fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims and other liabilities, and manage risk exposure, including by identifying potential hackers and other unauthorized users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enforce our Website &lt;a href="/company/websiteterms"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt.
and &lt;a href="/company/termsOfUse"&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comply with applicable legal requirements and industry standards and our policies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the data uses described above, we may use the information collected through cookies and other automated means to uniquely identify the electronic shopping basket you may create on our sites and enable you to retrieve shopping baskets you previously created.
We also may use cookies to identify and authenticate visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and other third parties.
We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services and events that may be of interest to you, for other promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="online-advertising"&gt;Online Advertising&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks.
Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means.
These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods.
The networks use this information to show you advertisements for GILT and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests.
The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors‘ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites.
This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="information-we-share"&gt;Information We Share&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may share the personal information we collect with our parent, affiliate and subsidiary companies, business partners, ad network vendors and their participants, and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including to communicate with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.
We also may share personal information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.
These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-choices"&gt;Your Choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We offer you certain choices about what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose the information, and how we communicate with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information.
We will apply your preferences going forward.
In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to GILT’s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot take advantage of certain GILT offerings or site features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the choices we offer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="sharing-information-with-business-partners"&gt;Sharing Information with Business Partners&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may direct GILT not to share your personal information with our business partners for those partners’ own purposes.
To do so, please email us at privacy@gilt.com.
