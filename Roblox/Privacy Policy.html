<p>Roblox values your trust, so we want to tell you about the personal information we collect from you when you use our websites and app, how we use it, and who we share it with. That’s why we've created this privacy policy to keep you informed.</p>
<p>Roblox is a global company, and this policy is for everyone around the world. Roblox has to follow laws designed to protect personal information in the different countries where our users live. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) in the US, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the EU and the UK, and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”) in Brazil apply to Roblox.</p>
<p>The laws in these countries give children (meaning users under the age of 13 for COPPA, for example) data protection rights. More information about these special rights are in the “Your Privacy Rights” sections below. You can also see the <a href="#parental-controls" target="_self" rel="undefined">"Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls"</a> section for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of our children users and the measures we take to afford children users with additional protections and comply with applicable data protection legislation, depending on where you are located.</p>
<p>You can learn more about COPPA, by looking at this simple guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program – www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.</p>
<p>If you or your parent or guardian have questions about this policy or how we use your personal information, you can contact us by completing this <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Support Form</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can email our GDPR representative if you are in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland or by telephoning or writing to the Roblox office in California or our office for the EEA or the UK.</p>

<summary>3. Information Collected on our Corporate Websites</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>Please note that our corporate websites (which may include corp.roblox.com, blog.roblox.com, and their subdomains) are general audience websites. On these sites, we may provide information regarding the corporate side of Roblox, press information, career information, and other general audience information. We may also ask for your name, email address, employment details if you send us a CV, resume or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised job vacancy or a general inquiry regarding employment opportunities with us and other information so that we can provide corporate-related information to you or respond to your job application. No experiences are available on the corporate websites. As such, the parts of this Privacy Policy that discuss experiences or discuss children are not applicable to the corporate websites.</p>
</div>
</details>
<div class="lang-friendly">
<p>We have a number of corporate websites, such as corp.roblox.com and blog.roblox.com. These sites explain our technology and who works at Roblox. There is news on there about the company and we let people know about job openings that they can apply for at Roblox. There is also information on there for parents in the resources section. While these websites are generally aimed at adults, you can also visit them to learn more about Roblox as a company.</p>
<p>We only collect information from people on these websites when someone is applying for a job.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion-section"><details>
<summary>4. Information You Provide when Setting Up an Account on Roblox</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>All users must create a Roblox account to join any experiences. To create a Roblox account, we will ask you to create a unique username and password (so you can log into your account) and to provide other demographic information, such as your age or date of birth, gender, regional location or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Roblox).</p>
<p>Users are strongly encouraged not to create a username that reflects their own name or other Personal Information. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share their password.</p>
<p>Usernames are used for participating in Service features, and we do not use them to identify individual users outside of their activities on our Service. Usernames are shared with the parties listed in Section 7 below.</p>
<p>Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address to their account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this email address is to provide account security, since this is the only way for Roblox to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, children are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.</p>
</div>
</details>
<div class="lang-friendly">
<p>Everyone on Roblox has to create an account in order to participate in our experiences.</p>
<p>When you create a Roblox account, we will ask you to choose a unique username and password (so that you can log into your account).</p>
<p>We will also ask you for your date of birth, your gender, the country you live in and which language you speak.</p>
<p>You must not create a username that includes your real name. It is also important to create a password that is not easy to guess. You may share your password with your parent(s) or legal guardian, but never share it with anyone else, not even your friends.</p>
<p>You can also add an email address to your account in case you cannot remember your password and need to reset it.</p>

<summary>5. Additional Personal Information We Collect When You Use Roblox Features</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>In addition to account setup on Roblox, we may collect and process Personal Information from you directly if you use the following features and activities (as applicable):</p>
<ul>
<li><u>When you make purchases on the Service.</u> Users can purchase virtual currency or premium subscriptions, for example, in the form of Robux, Premium memberships, etc., and may use a variety of payment methods. When making purchases, users or their parents will be required to enter billing information, which may include name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. Our payment processors will process all purchases, and you will be subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy. Your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history may be retained and used by our payment processors to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries.</li>
<li><u>When you post, share, or otherwise transmit comments, messages, or content on Roblox via community features, such as public chat or private chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, portfolios, etc.</u> We may collect these comments, messages, posts, and they may be monitored, filtered and moderated for purposes such as removal of profanity, Personal Information, and other inappropriate content. Where permitted by law, we may use pre-filtered chat, comments and messages for purposes such as training and improving our filter technology to increase the safety on our platform.</li>
<li><u>When you participate in our Roblox Developer Exchange Program.</u> We require you to provide us with an IRS W-9 form (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 form (for non-U.S. taxpayers). We may also ask you to verify your identity by providing a government issued photo ID through a third-party vendor. For more information on the Developer Exchange program, please visit our <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Exchange Terms of Use</a>.</li>
<li><u>When you provide us with your phone number.</u> If you choose to provide a phone number during registration, you may receive a verification SMS after sign-up to confirm your ownership of the number, which will allow you to log in via mobile. Your phone number may also be used to recover a lost or forgotten password.</li>
<li><u>When you join our experiences on a VR platform.</u> If you join our experiences on a VR platform, we will collect your physical movement information in order to replicate your movement in the experience. This information is only used to provide the Service and is not stored.</li>

When you use these features, certain information from your social media accounts may be accessed by or shared with Roblox, and likewise, certain information about your use of Roblox may be posted to your profile on those platforms.</li>

In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information about the winners.</li>

We may use your voice recording for purposes such as training and improving our filter technology to increase the safety on our platform, except that we will not engage in these activities with private server voice chat recordings of EEA users.</li>
<li><u>When you request or agree to location-based services from Roblox, which may be available to our users other than children.</u> With your consent, we may collect or track real-time or precise geolocation information to provide services such as tagging, check-in and content delivery, or geo-based advertising, or other services that are dependent on knowing where you are. This information may be collected in combination with an identifier associated with your device to enable us to recognize your mobile browser or device when you return to the Service. You can always stop the collection of location information by updating your device settings, stopping the use of the Service, or uninstalling our mobile applications.</li>
<li><u>When you subscribe to other features or activities, which may be available to our users other than children.</u> We may offer other features or activities on our Services from time to time, and you may be able to submit or upload Personal Information in connection with such features. The data being collected for such features and their intended uses will be evident at the time of data collection.</li>

<summary id="cookies">6. Cookies and Similar Technologies</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>Like most websites, we use cookies and other standard internet technologies to help us improve our Service.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, for example so you don’t have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the website or browse from one page to another.</p>
<p>A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. By lifespan, a cookie is either a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session cookie which is erased when the user closes the browser; or</li>
<li>Persistent cookie which remains on the user’s computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the domain to which it belongs, there are either:</p>
<ul>
<li>First-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (in this case roblox.com domain); or</li>
<li>Third-party cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page’s domain. This can happen when the webpage references a file, such as JavaScript, located outside its domain</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</h4>
<p>A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about visitors’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a visitor has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.</p>
<h4>How we use cookies</h4>
<p>When you visit or access the Service, we may – by means of cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and/or other similar technologies – automatically collect technical information about the devices and software you use to access the Service, such as the type of Internet browser or mobile device you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Service, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and other similar technical information. These same technologies (or a combination of them) may also be used to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture and store users’ preferences, account settings, and certain login information (for convenience, user verification, and account security);</li>
<li>Compile statistics and analytics about your use of and interaction with the Service, including details about how and where our Service is downloaded from or accessed, how often a user visits or uses the Service, the date and time of user visits to, and actions on, the Service, which areas of the Service are visited and for how long, information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data;</li>
<li>Mobile analytic tools to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and gain insights about how mobile software is used;</li>
<li>Gather important functionality, testing, and performance data about our Service, including performance data related to our mobile application, the Roblox Player, and Roblox Studio, such as networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data;</li>
<li>Moderate user behavior on the Service, such as protecting against payment fraud and other inappropriate activities;</li>
<li>Gather demographic information about our user base; and;</li>
<li>Perform other similar functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not use cookies or similar technologies other than for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Third party advertising and ad networks</h4>
<p>Roblox partners with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (“third-party advertising companies”) to promote our Service. If you respond to one of our advertisements and visit or register to use our Service, we or our service providers may provide these third-party advertising companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.</p>
<p>For our users that are children, Roblox partners with third-party advertising companies to serve contextual advertising, cap the frequency of advertising, and provide related uses permitted by COPPA. Roblox does not show behaviorally targeted or retargeted ads to children or track such users for the purposes of directing targeted advertising.</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to disable advertising-related tracking at your request, companies may need to set an opt-out cookie on your browser. Sometimes a browser’s configuration may prevent companies from setting such cookies, for example, if your browser is set to block all third-party cookies by default. Therefore, you may need to change your browser settings to accept cookies, in order to fully disable advertising-related tracking.</p>

<p>For all other sites, please clear your cookies and refresh your browser to display the cookie banner to access its settings.</p>

<summary id="information-sharing">7. Information Sharing</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>Please note that Roblox has not and does not sell Personal Information about you to third-party companies for their independent purposes. Roblox may disclose your information for a business purpose as set forth below.</p>
<h4>Service Providers</h4>
<p>Roblox may share users’ information, including Personal Information which includes but is not limited to billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf. These providers may operate or support certain functions of the Service. Below is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third-party service providers, and the names of the providers we may use to perform these functions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Account Integrity and Security (e.g., Veriff, Arkose Labs);</li>
<li>Analytics services (e.g., Google LLC);</li>
<li>User Acquisition services (e.g., AppsFlyer);</li>
<li>Community filtering and moderation services (e.g., CommunitySift);</li>
<li>Customer support services (e.g., Zendesk);</li>
<li>Surveys and promotions (e.g., Reach3);</li>
<li>Social Media Log-in (e.g., SAP Customer Data Cloud);</li>
<li>Billing services and payment gateway providers (e.g., Kount, Worldpay, PayPal, Incomm, Blackhawk, Google, Apple, Amazon, Windows Store, Xbox, Xsolla); and</li>
<li>Hosting and content delivery network services (e.g., AWS, Equinix, CenturyLink, YouTube, Vimeo).</li>
</ol>
<p>These third party service providers are only allowed to use the Personal Information shared with them for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do and consistent with this Privacy Policy, and for no other purposes. They are not permitted to sell the Personal Information shared with them. Roblox takes steps to ensure that all service providers with access to Personal Information are capable of protecting the information we share with them.</p>
<h4>Public forums and community areas</h4>
<p>We offer users the ability to use forums and similar means of public discussion. If you use any messaging, posting, or chat functions on Roblox, you should be aware that any Personal Information submitted there will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users. This information can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and it could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for how other individuals use the information posted in this manner.</p>
<h4>Creators</h4>
<p>The creators of the experiences you access will be provided your username, display name, user ID, and the regional location you are based in. The information shall enable the creators to determine their player base, so they can adjust their experiences to the legal requirements of the respective regional location. We offer creators a tool which allows them to review the regional location of origin of players who play their experiences. For this purpose, we will determine the user’s regional location of access to the Roblox website based on the IP address. We will not share your IP address with the creators.</p>
<h4>Legal disclosures</h4>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information about you as required or permitted by law and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose Personal Information about you in response to a request from law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other public agencies (including schools or children services), or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure may prevent a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Service, protect the security or integrity of our Service, or enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights.</p>
<h4>Business transfers</h4>
<p>Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Where required by applicable law, you will be informed of such disclosure and your consent obtained.</p>
<h4>De-identified information</h4>
<p>We share aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise de-identified information with third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; (iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality available through the Services.</p>
<h4>Do Not Track</h4>
<p>Roblox does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>
</div>
</details>
<div class="lang-friendly">
<p>Roblox doesn’t sell your information to other companies for them to use as they want.</p>
<p>Roblox does have relationships with some companies that help us provide our services (for example, when you or your parent purchase Robux), so we may provide some of your information to them, but only because we need to in order to complete your transaction.</p>
<p>We also hire other people and companies to perform services for us. A list of some of the companies we may use to perform these functions can be found in the detailed version of our privacy policy.The other companies are only allowed to use the personal information we share with them to complete tasks that we hire them to do. They are not allowed to sell your personal information or use it for their own purposes.</p>
<h4>Public forums and community areas</h4>
<p>There are some areas on Roblox such as in game chat where you can communicate with other Roblox users. These are public places and anything you share in these areas is available to other Roblox users who can access the same places. You should remember this before you post any information in these public areas. As you know, Roblox wants to create a safe space for all its users, so we do not allow you to share any personal information about yourself such as your name, where you live, or your email address.</p>
<h4>Creators</h4>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect the personal or other sensitive information submitted to us against the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under our control. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
<p>When using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of an incident that may qualify as a breach under applicable law, we will notify you consistent with applicable laws.</p>
<h4>Retention</h4>
<p>Roblox may retain users’ account data internally for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries;</li>
<li>Publicly shared content and virtual items are retained for use by the community (e.g., a user-created virtual shirt sold to another user is kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that item);</li>
<li>User account history is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries and to provide, improve and develop the Service;</li>
<li>To promote safety and security on the Service; and</li>
<li>To resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with our legal obligations.</li>

<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have measures in place to protect it against loss, misuse, or tampering. However, no security measures are 100% effective, so we cannot guarantee against these risks.</p>

<summary id="parental-controls">10. Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls</summary>
<div class="lang-detailed">
<p>Children are entitled to added protections with regard to their Personal Information and privacy online. For this reason, when children register for the Service, their account is automatically set to a more restrictive mode This means that child users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third-party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.</p>
<p>When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may collect a username, password, birthdate, and parent’s email address. This information is used to give the child access to the Service (with certain default settings) and, if a parent’s email is provided, to communicate with the parent about the child’s account. For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child’s account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to, and to determine when the child will be given broader access to features on our Service. In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from your child’s account, except as permitted under the applicable laws.</p>
<p>We may share aggregated or otherwise de-identified information of a child (which is information that cannot be used to identify such child) with third parties for various purposes such as: (i) compliance with reporting obligations; (ii) business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality available through the Services.</p>
<p>To make any requests for changes to your child’s account or requests for the removal of Personal Information collected about you or your child from our Service (as applicable), or to request that we stop the further collection or use of your or your child’s Personal Information in connection with the Service (as applicable), please complete the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support">Customer Support Form</a>.</p>
<p>We offer all accounts, including children’s accounts, the ability to modify chat/communication settings (for example, limiting interaction to just friends or no one), as well as a special “Restricted Account Mode” which turns off all forms of chat and public commenting and which allows the user to access only a selection of filtered experiences on Roblox. We recommend that parents familiarize themselves with all of the safety features and parental controls available in the Settings area of the Service (a description of which can be found here) and to accompany their children when they are playing online.</p>
<p>We proactively filter all public and comment areas of the Service (such as chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, etc.) to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, or other Personal Information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system uses a combination of human and automated processes. However, like all filtering technology, our systems are not 100% effective.</p>
<p>If you are a child, it is a good idea to talk to and ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission before using or playing on the Service. If you do not get such permission, you should not use our Service.</p>
<p>If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete any Personal Information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.</p>
</div>
</details>
<div class="lang-friendly">
<p>As a user you are entitled to additional protections for your information and privacy online. When you register an account with Roblox, we make sure your account is set to a restrictive mode, which means that you won’t have access to certain features, such as social media links, if you are not 13 or over and your text filtering will be restricted. These additional measures are in place to keep you as safe as possible online.</p>
<p>If your parent or guardian's email address is provided to us when you create an account on Roblox, we may share information about your account with them by email. We can also invite your parent or guardian to review or update settings and approve your account.</p>
<p>If you or your parents or guardian would like more information about the restrictive account mode, or parental controls available to them, please review our full privacy policy.</p>

<li>Cookies. We will use certain cookies only if you have previously consented to such use. When you visit our website with an EEA IP address, a cookie banner will appear asking you for your consent. You can manage your choice by clicking on “manage cookie preferences” in the cookie banner. We will save your choices in the form of a cookie. This cookie has a limited effective period of one year. The legal basis for this processing activity is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR (“consent”). In addition, you can also manage cookies using your browser settings. For further information on cookies and similar technologies see Section 6 above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Please note that we do not use your Personal Information for automated decision making which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.</p>
<h4>3. Personal data of children and Parental Consent.</h4>
<p>Please note that when users under the age of 13 register for the Service, their account is automatically set to “Privacy Mode.” This means that these users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.</p>
<p>When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate and parent email address. We process this information to give the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the minor’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child's account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service.</p>
<h4>4. Data sharing</h4>
<p>Roblox may share users’ information, including Personal Information like billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf.</p>
<p>These providers may operate or support certain functions of the Service. Below is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third party service providers and the names of the providers we may use to perform these functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Integrity and Security (e.g., Veriff, Arkose Labs);</li>
<li>Analytics services (e.g., Google LLC);</li>
<li>User Acquisition services (e.g., AppsFlyer);</li>
<li>Community filtering and moderation services (e.g., CommunitySift);</li>
<li>Customer support services (e.g., Zendesk);</li>
<li>Surveys and promotions (e.g., Reach3);</li>
<li>Social Media Log-in (e.g., SAP Customer Data Cloud);</li>
<li>Billing services and payment gateway providers (e.g., Kount, Worldpay, PayPal, Incomm, Blackhawk, Google, Apple, Amazon, Windows Store, Xbox, Xsolla); and</li>
<li>Hosting and content delivery network services (e.g., AWS, Equinix, CenturyLink, YouTube, Vimeo).</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Legal disclosure</h4>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information about you, including the content of your communications on the Service, to comply with legal process, including court orders and subpoenas, served on our Service. In addition, we also may disclose Personal Information about you, including content, in response to a request from law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other public agencies (including schools or children services), or if such disclosure may (i) prevent the instigation of a crime, (ii) facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Service, (iii) protect the security or integrity of our Service, or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights.</p>
<h4>6. Storage and international transfer of your personal data</h4>
<p>Roblox is based in the U.S. Your Personal Information that we collect is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America. Such storage is necessary in order to process the information.</p>
<p>Some of our agents and third-party service providers are located outside of Brazil, e.g. the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in Brazil. Wherever we transfer your Personal Information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure we rely on a legitimate international transfer mechanism, as set out in Brazilian data protection laws.</p>
<h4>7. Your rights as a Data Subject</h4>
<p>As a data subject located in Brazil, you have rights regarding your personal data. We provide mechanisms, as detailed below, so that you have clarity and transparency in exercising your rights. Whenever necessary, our team will be ready to meet any requests.</p>
<p>Confirm and access your personal data: You may request details and/or a copy of your personal data that is processed by us.</p>
<p>Update or correct your personal data: If You wish to alter your personal data or if you have any reason to believe or suspect that any data we have about you is wrong or incomplete, you may request us to rectify it.</p>
<p>If you wish, you may withdraw your consent, delete, block, request the anonymization or the portability of your data: You may (i) withdraw your consent, whenever the processing of personal data is based on consent; or (ii) request deletion of your personal data or deactivation of your account, at any time, in accordance with the law. The withdrawal of consent will prevent you from using the Services, and will result in the interruption of the processing of your data, except (i) the anonymized data; and (ii) data necessary to Roblox and/or to third parties involved in the provision of the Services for judicial, arbitration or administrative defense purposes, as well as to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
