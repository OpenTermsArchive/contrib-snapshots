Those informal discussions will start when written notice is sent from User to Roblox or from Roblox to User. Roblox will send User notice to the email address or billing address that User provided to Roblox. User will send notice to Roblox Corporation, Legal Department, 970 Park Place, Suite 100, San Mateo, CA 94403. If, after 60 days, User and Roblox cannot work things out, User and Roblox each agree to handle all <span class="tooltip">Dispute<span class="tooltiptext">Any dispute, action, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the User Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal or equitable basis, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these User Terms.</span></span>s between User and Roblox or Roblox’s affiliates, (except those exceptions specifically set out in <u>Section 16(d)</u> below and <span class="tooltip">Dispute<span class="tooltiptext">Any dispute, action, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the User Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal or equitable basis, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these User Terms.</span></span>s related to Roblox’s intellectual property rights) through binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator and that the arbitrator has the exclusive right to resolve any <span class="tooltip">Dispute<span class="tooltiptext">Any dispute, action, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the User Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal or equitable basis, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these User Terms.</span></span>, including whether any part of the <span class="tooltip">Roblox Terms<span class="tooltiptext">Collectively, the User Terms, the Creator Terms, the DevEx Terms, the Roblox Community Standards, the DMCA Guidelines and Policies and the Roblox TM Guidelines.</span></span> is void or voidable.</li>

Arbitration will be overseen by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”). User can find more information at www.adr.org. The arbitrator may award User damages, just like a court could, but only to the extent necessary to satisfy User’s individual claim.</li>
<li><span class="blurb-title">Fees and Location.</span> If User starts arbitration as described in these <span class="tooltip">User Terms<span class="tooltiptext">Terms applicable to all Users which provide an overview and the associated rules for things like (i) account creation, (ii) using Robux to make purchases, (iii) trading Virtual Items, and (iv) activities prohibited on the Platform.

You hereby waive any claims that you may have against Roblox for any payments made to an Owner by Roblox, and you agree to seek recovery of any payments due you solely from the Owner of any Group of which you are a member.

The two types of Virtual Items are In-Experience Items and Metaverse Items.</span></span> is outlined below (the “Robux Allocation”):
<ul>
<li><span class="blurb-title">The Platform’s Share:</span> Roblox is entitled to <u>30%</u> of the <span class="tooltip">Robux<span class="tooltiptext">The official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to purchase things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform.</span></span> generated from the sale of <span class="tooltip">Virtual Items<span class="tooltiptext">Any UGC available on the Services that Users can buy or earn, including game passes, in-game items or abilities, and digital items for avatars. Roblox may, in accordance with its policies and practices, elect not to permit a Virtual Item to be uploaded or published or may remove a Virtual Item from the Platform in its discretion.  The two types of Virtual Items are In-Experience Items and Metaverse Items.</span></span> on the <span class="tooltip">Platform<span class="tooltiptext">The platform which Roblox makes available in order to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span>. The <span class="tooltip">Platform<span class="tooltiptext">The platform which Roblox makes available in order to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span> is <u>always</u> Roblox.</li>
<li><span class="blurb-title">The Creator’s Share:</span> The Creator of an Experience or Virtual Item is entitled to <u>30%</u> of the <span class="tooltip">Robux<span class="tooltiptext">The official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to purchase things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform.</span></span> generated from the sale of any Virtual Items on the <span class="tooltip">Platform<span class="tooltiptext">The platform which Roblox makes available in order to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span>.</li>
<li><span class="blurb-title">The Distributor’s Share:</span> The Distributor of a given Virtual Item is entitled to <u>40%</u> of the <span class="tooltip">Robux<span class="tooltiptext">The official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to purchase things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform.</span></span> generated from the sale of such Virtual Item. For items sold on the Roblox Avatar Shop, Roblox would be considered both the <span class="tooltip">Platform<span class="tooltiptext">The platform which Roblox makes available in order to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span> <u>and</u> the Distributor. For In-Experience Items, the Creator would also be considered the Distributor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="blurb-title">Examples to Better Understand the Roblox Allocation</span> The following examples should help <span class="tooltip">Creators<span class="tooltiptext">Users who create and upload and publish UGC (like Virtual Items and Experiences) the Platform and include both amateur and professional developers.</span></span> to better understand the roles involved in the Roblox economy and how the <span class="tooltip">Robux<span class="tooltiptext">The official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to purchase things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform.</span></span> Allocation works in practice.
<ul>
<li><span class="blurb-title">Creator Sells a Virtual Item In the Roblox Avatar Shop:</span> A Creator creates a Virtual Item in the form of a hat to be worn by a Roblox avatar, and makes that Virtual Item available for sale in the Roblox Avatar Shop. Upon the sale of the Virtual Item, the <span class="tooltip">Robux<span class="tooltiptext">The official currency of the Platform which is used by Users to purchase things, like Virtual Items and access to Experiences, on the Platform.</span></span> generated from the sale would be divided as follows:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The Creator receives 30% of the Robux generated from the sale.</li>
<li>The Platform (always Roblox) receives 30% of the Robux generated from the sale).</li>
<li>The Distributor (in this case Roblox, the Distributor of the Roblox Avatar Shop) receives 40% of the Robux generated from the sale.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>Note that Roblox currently has different rates for 2D Virtual Items (also known as classic clothing) which are comprised of pants, shirts and T-Shirts. Robux generated from the sale of a 2D Virtual Item in the Roblox Avatar Shop are divided as follows: The Creator receives 70% of the Robux generated from the sale. The Platform (Roblox) receives 30% of the Robux generated from the sale</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="blurb-title">Creator Sells In-Experience Item in Experience created by that Creator:</span> A Creator creates an Experience and creates an In-Experience Item in the form of a game-pass that can be used in that Experience which is sold within the Experience.

If Creator is not the sole composer and/or writer of a musical work, Creator is responsible for ensuring that all co-composers and/or co-writers also notify their PRO in writing and Creator must have written proof of co-composers and/or co-writers approval to upload and use the musical work on the <span class="tooltip">Services<span class="tooltiptext">Collectively, all of the various features and services, like websites, applications, forums  and the Platform, which Roblox makes available to Users to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span>.

Creator warrants that Creator possesses all necessary rights needed to upload and synchronize a musical work on the <span class="tooltip">Platform<span class="tooltiptext">The platform which Roblox makes available in order to allow Users to play, create and connect.</span></span>.
