</p>
<p>When you submit a comment about a story or topic on one of our Web sites, an editor or reporter may contact you for clarification or for permission to use your comments in the newspaper or other publications of The Seattle Times Company.</p>

</p> Who else has access to your personally identifiable information? <ul>
<li>Third-party technology providers: In some cases, the service you sign up for is provided by a third-party technology or content provider.
When you use these third-party services offered on our sites, personally identifiable information you provide may be collected directly by these third parties solely in order to deliver the services you have requested.
These third-party partners may not use or distribute our users' information in any capacity outside of the service for which we contracted and they must comply with our privacy policies.
Some examples of third-party technology partners: Adicio, which operates the NWjobs.com online resume database, and WhatCounts, which operates our e-mail systems.
</li>
<li>Transactional partners: In some cases we partner with another company to co-promote their services within our Web sites.
Some examples of these are: NWsource Personals, powered by FastCupid Inc., and seattletimes.com sports contests provided by a variety of partners.
In these cases, you are transacting directly with the other party, and the personally identifiable information you enter on those services is shared both with that transactional partner and The Seattle Times Company.
On those pages requiring personally identifiable information, the transactional partner's brand is clearly visible, and their privacy statement is posted.
We encourage you to read it.
