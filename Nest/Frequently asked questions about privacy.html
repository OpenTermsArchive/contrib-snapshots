<p>What kind of data does Nest collect?</p>
<p>Nest collects the data we believe is necessary to provide a great experience with your Nest products and services – to help you save energy, to help you stay safe, and to keep you in touch with your home.
You can read more about the data that different Nest products collect in our Privacy Statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Nest use data?</p>
<p>We use data to offer and provide our products and services, and make them more thoughtful and responsive to you.
For example, your Nest Thermostat uses sensors to collect data such as temperature and humidity in the room.
This helps your thermostat keep you comfortable when you are at home, save energy when you are away, or adjust for sunlight warming your house.
For more information, see our Privacy Statement for Nest Products and Services</p>

<li>
<p>How does Nest use my Home and Away information?</p>
<p>If you choose to enable Home/Away Assist, we’ll use inputs from your product sensors and mobile phone to help determine if you’re home or away so that your products can work even better.
You have full control over how your Nest products respond to your Home and Away settings.

</li>
<li>
<p>Does Nest sell the data that it collects from my home?</p>
<p>Nest does not share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation and delivery of Nest products and services without asking you first.
We may use information you provide to send you surveys about your Nest use or other direct marketing and communications from Nest.
You can configure your marketing preferences in the Nest app or at nest.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Nest keep my data secure?</p>
<p>Nest works hard to keep your data secure.
For example, when you stream your camera video feed to your mobile phone, we protect this data with multiple layers of security, such as HTTPS and Transport Layer Security, while the data moves between your mobile phone, your products (like your Nest Cam), and our cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I access my data?</p>
<p>If you have a Nest account, you can download an archive of your Nest data at  nest.com/privacy/mynestdata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What data does My Nest Data provide?</p>
<p>Your data archive from My Nest Data includes information you’ve provided about yourself, like your email address.

and sensor data from Nest thermostats, smoke alarms, or cameras you’ve connected to your Nest account.
It also includes information about your device interactions and app usage.
If you have a Nest Aware subscription, and you requested your video history, we’ll send you that, too.</p>

<li>
<p>Can I download my Google data using the My Nest Data tool?</p>
<p>The My Nest Data tool provides information only about your Nest products and services.

<p>Is my video history saved as soon as I request my data through the My Nest Data tool?</p>

<p>Can I access my data if I’m a member of a Family Account?</p>
<p>Anyone with a Nest account can request their data using My Nest Data.
Family account members can request their Nest data and it may include information about products that are shared on the family account.
If a member of a family account makes a request via My Nest Data, all members who share access to the home will receive an email letting them know the request has been made.

<p>How can I object to data processing about me?</p>
