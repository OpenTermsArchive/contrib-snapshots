For example, we keep some device and sensor data for Nest Protect for about thirteen months or until you delete your account.</p> Data we retain for extended periods for limited purposes <p>Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time.
For example, when Nest processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes.
Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security, fraud &amp.
abuse prevention</li>
<li>Financial record-keeping</li>
<li>Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>

</ul> Enabling account deletion <p>When you delete your Nest account, we disable login and then start the account deletion process.
Our systems are designed to delete Nest Aware video footage within a few days and most other account data within a few months.
however, some data may persist for longer periods of time.</p>
