<p>(e) Effect of Termination.
Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and your right to use the Services will automatically terminate.</p>
2.
Accounts
<p>(a) Your Account.
To use certain Services and Products, you must register for a user account (“Account”) and provide certain information about yourself, as prompted by the applicable registration form.
You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information that you submit is truthful and accurate.
(b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information.
and (c) your use of the Services and Products will not violate any US or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are not located in an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations).
You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and for all activities that occur under your Account.
You agree to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account and to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access.
You agree to immediately notify Nest of any unauthorised use or suspected unauthorised use of your Account, or any other breach of security.
Nest is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
<p>(b) The individual who creates an Account is the “Owner” of that Account and is the Owner of the Products associated with that Account.
Individuals who are authorised to access an Owner’s Products and Services are “Authorised Users”.
Authorised Users may have the ability to use the Services and monitor and control the Products (for example, an Authorised User can change your heating and cooling schedule or turn your camera on or off).
Authorised Users may also have the ability to view information (including personal information) and content across all of an Owner’s Products, Services and Works with Nest connections (for example, an Authorised User will receive mobile alerts or can view your video history).
Authorised Users are responsible for their own actions in connection with the Products and Services, but the Owner also hereby agrees to be fully responsible for all actions taken by Authorised Users relating to the Owner’s Products, Services and Account.
If you are an Owner who invites or enables an Authorised User, you acknowledge and agree that said Authorised User may subsequently invite or enable other Authorised Users with the same access and ability to use your Products and Services set out above.
As a result, if you are an Owner, you should only authorise those individuals whom you trust to access your Account, Products and Services.</p>
3.
Access to Services
<p>(a) Access and Use.
Subject to these Terms, Nest grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive right (without the right to sub-license) to access and use the Services by (i) using the Web Apps in connection with, and solely for the purpose of, controlling and monitoring the Products you own or are authorised to control and monitor or otherwise accessing a service explicitly provided by Nest for your use (the “Permitted Purpose”), (ii) installing and using the Mobile Apps solely on your own handheld mobile device (e.g., iPhone, iPad or Android smartphone) and solely for the Permitted Purpose, and (iii) accessing the Sites solely for the Permitted Purpose.</p>

You consent to this automatic update.
If you do not want such Updates, your remedy is to terminate your Account and stop using the Services and the Products.
If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically.

Over time, Nest may provide the opportunity for you to interface the Products and Services to one or more third-party products and services, through and using the Services, for example through the Works with Nest platform (“Third-Party Products and Services”).
You decide whether you want to interface, and with which Third-Party Products and Services you want to interface.
Your explicit consent and authorisation is required for this interface and is revocable by you at any time.
Once your consent is given for a particular Third-Party Product and Service, you agree that Nest may exchange information and control data regarding you and your products, including your personal information, in order to enable the interface that you have authorised.
Once this information is shared with the particular Third-Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy and not by Nest’s privacy documentation.
You acknowledge and agree that Nest makes no representation or warranty about the quality or safety of any Third-Party Products or Services or the interface with Product and Services.
Accordingly, Nest is not responsible for your use of any Third-Party Product or Service, or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third-Party Products or Services.
You should contact the third party with any questions about their Third-Party Products and Services.</p>
<p>(d) Certain materials may be displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photographs, video, images and illustrations (“Content”)).
The Content also includes information that you and other users provide us with in the course of using the Services (collectively, “User Submissions”), which we may use to provide, maintain and improve the Services.
Some Content may be visible to others (for example, the Services allows you to upload, post or otherwise share video content).

Nest reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.</p>

Any future release, update or other addition to functionality of the Services shall be subject to these Terms.</p>
<p>(f) Open Source.
Certain items of independent, third-party code may be included in the Web Apps and/or Mobile Apps that are subject to the GNU General Public License (“GPL”) or other open-source licences (“Open-Source Software”).
The Open-Source Software is licensed under the terms of the licence that accompanies such Open-Source Software.
Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end-user licence for such Open-Source Software.

Although the Sites are accessible worldwide, the Products and Services provided or accessed through or on the Sites are not available to all persons or in all countries.
If you choose to access the Sites from outside a country in which Nest supports the Product and Services listed here (“Target Country”), you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws in your country.
You understand and accept that the Sites are not designed for use in a non-Target Country and that some, or all, of the features of the Sites may not work or be appropriate for use in such a country.

Agreed Usage and Limitations of Nest Services and Products
<p>(a) Intended Use of Nest Services.
The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Nest Products.
While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time.
The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Nest’s control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and operators, among others.
You acknowledge these limitations and agree that Nest is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services.</p>
<p>(b) No Life Safety or Critical Uses of the Products and Services.
You acknowledge and agree that the Products and Services, whether standing alone or when interfaced with Third-Party Products or Services, are not certified for emergency response, unless expressly approved and certified by Nest as enabled for central station monitoring through a professional central station monitoring facility (“Pro Monitoring Enabled Nest Products”).
Nest makes no warranty or representation that use of the Products (including, without limitation, any Pro Monitoring Enabled Nest Product) or Services with any Third-Party Product or Service will affect or increase any level of safety.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT FOR PRO MONITORING ENABLED NEST PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHETHER STANDING ALONE OR INTERFACED WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.
FURTHER, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NEST DISPATCH EMERGENCY SERVICES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.</p>
<p>(c) Central Station Monitoring for Pro Monitoring Enabled Nest Products.
For Pro-Monitoring Enabled Nest Products, you may be given the option of selecting a subscription plan with a third-party professional central monitoring provider (the “Third-Party Monitoring Provider”) for professional monitoring and related emergency notification and dispatch of emergency authorities (“Pro-Monitoring”).
You understand and agree that if you select a Pro Monitoring subscription plan, you are contracting directly with the Monitoring Provider to provide the Pro Monitoring.
you are not contracting with Nest to provide the Pro Monitoring and Nest will not be providing the Pro Monitoring.
You further understand that the Monitoring Provider and Nest are independent operating companies.
There is no legal partnership, agency, joint venture, employer/employee, master/servant, or other similar legal relationship between the Monitoring Provider and Nest, and the Monitoring Provider is not a subcontractor of Nest.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT PRO MONITORING WILL ONLY WORK WITH PRO MONITORING ENABLED NEST PRODUCTS.
DO NOT USE OR ATTEMPT TO USE PRO MONITORING WITH ANY PRODUCTS, WHETHER MANUFACTURED OR SOLD BY NEST OR THIRD PARTIES, THAT ARE NOT PRO MONITORING ENABLED NEST PRODUCTS.</p>
<p>(d) Permits and Registration for Pro Monitoring.
Some local governments have various permit or registration requirements for use of the Products with Pro Monitoring.
Without the required permit or registration, emergency responders may not respond to requests from a Third-Party Monitoring Provider for emergency dispatch, and/or fines and penalties may be levied against you by the applicable local government.
You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining, maintaining and renewing any permit or registration that may be required by your local government in the event you select a subscription plan for Pro Monitoring of the Products.
Further, you agree to be solely responsible for any fines and penalties that may be assessed against you arising from your failure to obtain, maintain and renew any applicable permits or registrations.</p>
<p>(e) Reliability of Services.
You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile notifications, are not error-free or 100% reliable and 100% available.
Proper functioning of the Services relies and is dependent on, among other things, the transmission of data through your wi-fi network, enabled wireless device (such as a phone or tablet) and broadband internet access, or optional Cellular Backup service, for which neither Nest nor any wireless or data carrier is responsible, and may be interrupted, delayed, refused, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including insufficient coverage, power outages, termination of service and access, environmental conditions, interference, non-payment of applicable fees and charges, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, upgrades, repairs or relocations, and priority access by emergency responders in the event of a disaster or emergency (collectively, “Service Interruptions”).
You understand that Service Interruptions may result in the Services being unreliable or unavailable for the duration of the Service Interruption.
We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications within any given time, or at all.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES.
MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE STATUS AND ALARMS ON YOUR NEST PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY – THEY ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY-NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.
There is no way for Nest to provide specific information relating to a situation in your home or elsewhere.
You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.</p>
<p>(f) Service Interruptions.
no refund or rebate.
The Services may be suspended temporarily, without notice, for security reasons, systems failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances.
You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions.
Nest does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.</p>
<p>(g) System Requirements.
The Services will not be accessible without: (i) a working Wi-Fi network in your home that is positioned to communicate reliably with the Products.
(ii) an Account.
(iii) an enabled and supported wireless device, such as a phone or tablet (required for some features and functionalities of the Service).
(iv) always-on broadband Internet access in your home with bandwidth sufficient to support the Products you use.
and (v) other system elements that may be specified by Nest.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that they are compatible and properly configured.
You acknowledge that the Services may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been met.
If you modify, substitute, move, or otherwise change any of the required system elements, it is your sole duty and responsibility to be sure they are compatible and properly configured to work with the Products and Services.
In addition, you acknowledge that Nest may activate Bluetooth on your smartphone or tablet, with or without prior notification, in order to facilitate proper operation of the Services, enable communication with Nest Products connected to the same Nest account and enable certain features (such as remote silencing of a smoke or CO alarm on Nest Protect).</p>
<p>(h) Cellular Back-Up in Case of Wi-Fi Outage.
In the event of any Service Interruptions to your home’s Wi-Fi network or internet connection, the Services may be unreliable or unavailable for the duration of the Service Interruption.
If you have subscribed for Pro Monitoring, this means that the Third-Party Monitoring Provider may not receive alarm signals from your Pro Monitoring Enabled Nest Products to provide Pro Monitoring, and may be unable to dispatch emergency responders in the event of an actual emergency.
Further, features and functionalities of the Products and Services may be unavailable on you Mobile App for the duration of the Service Interruption.
You may have an option of selecting a cellular back-up subscription plan (“Cellular Backup”) to help improve connectivity in the event of any Service Interruption and decrease the likelihood of interruption of the Services (including Pro Monitoring) and access to the various features and functionalities of your Products and Services on your Mobile App.</p>
<p>(i) Energy Savings and Other Benefits.
Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee”, Nest does not guarantee or promise any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Services or any feature thereof.
Actual energy savings and monetary benefits vary depending on factors beyond Nest’s control or knowledge.
From time to time, Nest may use the Services to provide you with information that is unique to you and your energy usage and suggest an opportunity to save money on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Services.
We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household.
You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual savings and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from Nest if your savings differ.</p>

All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”.
We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER/JURY TRIAL WAIVER
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p>
<p>(a) Arbitration.
Nest and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise from or relate to these Terms or the Services or Products in any way, except for claims arising from bodily injury.
THIS ARBITRATION IS MANDATORY AND NOT PERMISSIVE.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, including, for example:</p>
<p>• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us that is created by or involves these Terms or the Services or Products, regardless of the legal theory;</p>
<p>• claims for mental or emotional distress or other emotional/mental injury arising from the relationship between us;</p>
<p>• claims that arose before you accepted these Terms (such as claims related to disclosures or the marketing of the Services or Products, or the process for seeking approval to use the Services or Products);</p>
<p>• claims that may arise after the termination of your use of the Services or Products or any agreement between us.
and</p>
<p>• claims brought by or against our respective subsidiaries, parent companies, members and affiliates, as well as the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns of these entities, you, and Nest.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude either of us from bringing an individualised action in small claims court.
It also does not preclude either of us from seeking an individualised preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, pending arbitration, in any court that has jurisdiction.
Nor does this arbitration agreement bar you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
In addition, you or Nest may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect your or its trade secrets and intellectual property rights or to prevent loss or damage to its services in any court with competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE, LAW, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH (A) WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
(B) WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.</p>
<p>(b) Notice of Disputes.
If either of us intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other with notice in writing.
The notice to Nest should be sent to: Nest Legal Department c/o Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N Sacramento, CA 95833, USA.
Nest will send notice to you at the email and/or mailing addresses associated with your account.
Your notice to Nest must (a) provide your name, mailing address, and email address.
(b) describe the dispute.
and (c) state the relief you are requesting.
If we are unable to reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within 60 days after the notice is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>(c) Arbitration Procedures.
The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute.
Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you are receiving Nest Services.
If the value of your claim is USD $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by telephone, or by an in-person hearing.
If the value of your claim exceeds USD $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or the arbitrability of disputes are for the court to decide.
The arbitrator may consider, but is not bound by, rulings in other arbitrations between Nest and Nest users.
The arbitrator can award the same individualised damages and relief that a court can award.
Judgement on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(d) Costs of Arbitration.
The AAA’s fee schedule is subject to change and may be found in the AAA Rules (available online at www.adr.org).
Nest will pay all AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees for any arbitration that Nest commences.
If you provided Nest with 60 days’ notice of your intent to arbitrate before commencing arbitration and the value of your claim is USD $75,000 or less, Nest will pay your share of any such AAA fees.
If the value of your claim exceeds USD $75,000, the allocation of AAA fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (unless the law of your state requires Nest to pay all such fees).
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such cases, the arbitrator may direct you to reimburse Nest for amounts that Nest paid on your behalf.</p>
<p>(e) No Class Arbitration.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND NEST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED GROUP LITIGATION OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.
Further, unless all affected parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or group proceeding.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
<p>(f) 30-Day Opt-Out Period.
If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this Section 13, you must notify Nest in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept these Terms (unless a longer period is required by applicable law).
Your written notification must be mailed to Nest at the following address: Nest Legal Department c/o Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N Sacramento, CA 95833, USA.
Subject to Section 13(g) below, if you do not notify Nest in accordance with this Section 13(f), you agree to be bound by the arbitration and group litigation waiver provisions of these Terms, including such provisions in any Terms revised after the date of your first acceptance.</p>
<p>Such notification must include: (a) your name, (b) your Nest account email address, (c) your mailing address and (d) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Nest through arbitration.
This notification affects these Terms only.
if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with Nest or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration provision in these Terms shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and Nest.</p>
<p>(g) Future Changes to Arbitration Provision.
If Nest makes any changes to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section of these Terms (other than a change to the address at which Nest will receive notices of dispute, opt-out notices or rejections of future changes to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Nest Legal Department c/o Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N Sacramento, CA 95833, USA.
It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section of these Terms if you had properly opted out of the arbitration and group litigation waiver provisions in this Section 13 within the first 30 days after you first accepted these Terms.
If you have not properly opted out of the arbitration and group litigation waiver provisions in this Section 13, by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this arbitration provision, as modified by any changes you did not reject.</p>
