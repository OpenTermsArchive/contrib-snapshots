<p>
<strong>13.
Governing Law.
Venue.</strong>
</p>
<p>The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes.

Otherwise, you agree that this EULA, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of California, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.
Any action or proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such claim or dispute, except that Nest Labs may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or Confidential Information.</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>16.
Severability.</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>17.
Waiver.</strong>
</p>
<p>All waivers by Nest Labs will be effective only if in writing.
Any waiver or failure by Nest Labs to enforce any provision of this EULA on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
