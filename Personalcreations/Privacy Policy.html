<b>What information does Provide Commerce collect from you or about you?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, each of our Sites collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non Personally Identifiable Information.
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Sites.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information:</i>
</b> “Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you.
Personally Identifiable Information is requested when you register with us, order a product or service, fill out surveys, participate in contests or sweepstakes, correspond with us, or otherwise volunteer information, for instance, through the use of one of our greeting, hint or reminder services or to request a catalog.
Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information.
If you are using a greeting, email a friend, hint or reminder service on one of our Sites, we may ask you to provide the name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, age, date of birth, anniversary date or other personal annuity date of you, a friend, a loved one, family members or other third parties, and certain holiday information that may reveal one’s religious background, so that we may send them or you an email, hint or reminder about an event that could be made more special with the gift of our products.
We may also collect certain financial information, like your credit card number (or a check or money order if using such payment method while ordering via mail).
whenever we do so, we will attempt to provide a link to this Policy so that you can confirm how this information will be used.
With this information, we can fill your service and product orders and better provide you with personalized services.
You also may have the option of importing information into certain Sites from third-party software.
This information may include the types of information described above, as well as other types of information that you have entered into these third-party programs.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Non Personally Identifiable Information:</i>
</b> “Non Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information.
We may gather certain information about you such as age, date of birth, gender, anniversary date or other personal annuity date of you, a friend, a loved one, family members or other third parties, certain holiday information that may reveal one’s religious background, as well as consumer purchasing information based upon where you shop on any one of our Sites.
This information may be compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.
This information may include the website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet.
An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Internet.
Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.
In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer.
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b>
</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide our visitors with a superior customized online experience.
Among other things, we use customer contact information to fill orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, to trace false orders, to remind customers of events through our reminder service(s), to send our customers’ friends or loved ones greetings, emails or hints to send our products through a greeting, email a friend or hint service, and to send service emails, newsletters, and promotional emails from us or third parties.
We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate or segmented customer behavior.
This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of each of our Sites for product development purposes and to improve the design of our Sites.
We may also use information to notify consumers about updates to our Sites, to complete user initiated transactions, to trace false orders and to contact consumers directly, or through our third-party service partners, for marketing purposes.
In addition, we may seek to update you or your recipients’ personal information in our records through third party services that provide updated names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and other information.
We may then use this acquired information to enhance our services or marketing efforts to you or your recipients.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Shopping:</i>
</b> We collect certain information from visitors while shopping on our Sites for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites.

<p>

We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you or the recipient (as appropriate) about your order (“Operational Emails”), to send you newsletters and promotional emails (as described below), and trace false orders.
Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.
If you cancel an order or do not complete an order we may collect and use any email address or other information that you have entered as we would collect and use it if you had completed an order.
Please note that our Operational Emails about your order may contain some additional marketing offers from us or our trusted third party partners.

<p> </p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Cookies:</i>
</b> Like many other commercial sites, our Sites utilize standard technologies called “cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how each of our Sites is used, and provide direct personalized marketing from Provide Commerce.
A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us.
Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site.
A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie.
Cookies can securely store a customer’s password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a “shopping cart.” For instance, cookies allow us to prepopulate (or fill in) an email field with your email address if you revisit one of our Sites and place an order.
A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your email address.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. </p>
<p>We send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes.
No Personally Identifiable Information is recorded.
When you click through to any one of our Sites from a promotional email, our third-party advertising service partner may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related information.

<i>Clear GIFs:</i>
</b> At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit or the benefit of a third-party to help us or such third-party measure advertising effectiveness.
Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our Sites by informing us of what content is effective.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users.
The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>These third-party service partners use clear GIFs: (i) in HTML based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
(ii) to record when products have been ordered from our Sites.
and (iii) to track the visitor traffic on our Sites.
These clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of each of our Sites by our visitors and the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.
We may also use clear GIFs in a similar manner in our own emails and on our Sites.</p>
<p>Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company.
That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer.
This collected information can be shared with the advertising company.
We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit.</p>

<b>How do we treat information related to children and privacy?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on websites directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or on websites that know they are collecting Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.
We want to let you know that it currently is our policy not to collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person under 13 because children are not permitted to use the Sites or services on the Sites, and we request that children under 13 not submit any personal information to us via the Sites.
As one measure to ensure that we do not gather Personally Identifiable Information from children, we require that all individuals provide a valid credit card number before completing a purchase order.
If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13, we shall erase such information from our records and terminate the applicable account.
Our greeting, hint or reminder services are designed not to gather birthdates (with years) or other personal information directly from children under 13.
However, there may be instances where you will be allowed to enter birthdates (with years) for children under 13 while using one of our greeting, hint or reminder services whereby no Personally Identifiable Information, other than name, may be linked to such child.
This process is designed so that we will not knowingly market to such children under 13 while being able to provide you with increased functionality for our greeting, hint or reminder services.</p>

<b>How does this Policy apply to third-party, co-branded or private label websites accessible from our Sites? </b>
<p> </p>
<p>Other sites accessible through any of our Sites have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.
Please consult each site’s privacy policy.
We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties.
The information practices of those websites linked to our Sites are not covered by this Policy.
These other sites may send their own cookies or clear GIFs to users, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information.
Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our Sites may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies or clear GIFs.
We cannot control this collection of information.
You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
<p>We also may have co-branded websites or private labeled websites that are maintained by us in connection with one or more of our third-party business partners but which sites do not contain this Policy or a link to this Policy.
When you submit information to one of these websites, the websites may share your information with Provide Commerce and our third-party business partners or just with our third-party business partner.
Note that these websites may contain, or link to, privacy policies that contain terms and conditions different than those contained in this Policy.
Again, this Policy only pertains to the information Provide Commerce collects from the Sites and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our business partners.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those co-branded and private labeled sites so that you will always know what information we gather and what information is gathered by our third-party business partner, how each of us might use that information, to whom each of us will disclose it and what choices you have.</p>
