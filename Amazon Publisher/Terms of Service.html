We may provide you with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case, you will not charge and or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate. We may deduct or withhold any taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any amounts payable to you under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms, and payment to you as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to you of amounts payable under these Amazon Demand Program Specific Terms.
