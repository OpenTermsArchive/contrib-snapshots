Information Collected Online
1. General Browsing
We collect general information about our visitors’ experience with our Websites and this general information is not connected to personally identifiable information about individual visitors. The information collected includes which pages our visitors are viewing on our Websites and whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites.  It also includes information on the type of browser and service provider used.  And for visitors using a mobile version of our Websites, this includes technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.   All of this information helps us provide a better experience for our visitors by being able to determine such things as how to best format our mobile Websites for various devices, our most desired pages, products and features, how to best direct visitors to our Websites, and where there might be browser or service provider connection issues.
2. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect
Abercrombie & Fitch collects personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily provide us with this information. You can provide us this personally identifiable information in many instances throughout our Websites, for example when you interact with the following opportunities: placing an order through one of our Websites; establishing an account; adding your choices and information about yourself and others to your account; registering to participate in a promotion; emailing an item, post card or wish list; adding a message in the gift wrap section or on an E-Gift Card; entering a contest or sweepstakes; requesting an opportunity to model for us; taking a survey; contacting us with a comment or question; signing up to receive emails about our products and services; requesting to receive investor alerts; or applying for a job online. We also collect information through use of cookies, pixel tags (also known as Web beacons and clear GIFs) and URL links, as described under "Cookies" below. While not personally identifiable information by itself, Abercrombie & Fitch also collects and retains the following and associates it with your personally identifiable information: your IP address, your interactions with our Websites, your actions in response to our communications to you, and the purchases you make.
Categories of personally identifiable information collected online include name, address, gender, month and day of birth, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, payment card information, recipient's name, address and email address, modeling information (including name, size stats, work information, and contact information), use of our Websites tied to one of these categories and any other information you choose to provide, including through your Facebook account, as described below.
3. Information Collected If You Allow Us to Access Your Facebook Account
Abercrombie & Fitch may allow you to use your Facebook account information to provide us information requested when you participate in features on our Websites. If you chose to provide us information through your Facebook account, Abercrombie & Fitch could collect some, and possibly all, of the data indicated on the Request for Permission screen that you click to grant us permission to collect this information. This information could include: your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, birthday, likes, education history, work history, current city, hometown, interests, relationship status, and any other information you have shared with everyone on Facebook. Please keep in mind that Facebook may change the types of information that may be accessed when you use this process to provide us information, so you should carefully review the Request for Permission from Facebook prior to using this method of providing information to our Websites. It is also possible that Abercrombie & Fitch will be able to continue to collect this information from your Facebook account should the information be revised by you later.
This privacy policy does not cover the privacy and security practices of Facebook. Please review the Facebook privacy policy and terms if you have any questions about their privacy or security practices.
4. Information Collected Directly by Third Parties
If you are an investor and elect to sign up to receive your proxy materials via electronic document delivery or email alerts, you will provide your personal information directly to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., our third party service provider.
Information Collected on Pages Abercrombie & Fitch Has on Social Media Sites
Personal information may be collected directly by Abercrombie & Fitch through Social Media Pages and may also be collected by the social media site hosting the Abercrombie & Fitch Social Media Page.
Personal Information collected directly by Abercrombie & Fitch: The collection of personal information directly by Abercrombie & Fitch on its Social Media Pages will include the type of information addressed under “Personally Identifiable Information We Collect” above. Examples of how personal information may be directly collected on Abercrombie & Fitch Social Media Pages include providing information through an application or form which has a link to this privacy policy. We will use and share the information we collect on our Social Media Pages in the manner specified below in “Using Information We Collect Online” and in “Information We Share With Third Parties.”
Personal Information collected by the social media sites: This privacy policy does not cover the privacy and security practices of the social media sites on which Abercrombie & Fitch has Social Media Pages. Please review privacy policies and terms of service on the social media sites if you have any questions about their privacy or security practices.
The social media sites where Abercrombie & Fitch has its Social Media Pages may provide aggregate information and analysis to Abercrombie & Fitch about your use of our Social Media Pages. This allows us to better understand and analyze our user growth, general demographic information about the users of our Social Media Pages, and interaction with content on our Social Media Pages. Overall, this information may be used to help us understand the types of visitors and users of our Social Media Pages and use of the content.
Using Information We Collect Online
We use the information collected on our Websites to fulfill product orders; to fulfill your requests (such as contact us, click to chat, email a friend, wish list or sending a post card); to contact you or the product recipient(s) in the event of order or delivery difficulties; to send marketing communications regarding our products, services, and promotions to you; to analyze your activity with us, including interaction with our Websites and your purchases; to personalize our communications to you; to respond to your inquiries; to update information maintained in your online account; to conduct surveys, sweepstakes or contests; to develop our products, services, and Websites; and to consider you for employment. In addition, the information collected in the Online Store will be used for these same marketing communications about our products, services, and Websites.  Abercrombie & Fitch uses the information collected on its Social Media Pages to send communications regarding our products, services, and promotions; to respond to your inquiries; to conduct surveys, sweepstakes or contests; to analyze your activity on our Social Media Pages, and to develop our products and services.
Information We Share With Third Parties
If, when you provide us your email, you elect to share your email address with our affiliated companies (for example, Hollister Co. and Gilly Hicks) so that they may send you promotional materials, we will share your email address with them. You can be assured that except for similar limited circumstances as specified below and also in their privacy policies, our affiliated companies will not sell or rent your email address to unrelated third parties.
We make the names and postal addresses in our postal mailing list, sometimes categorized by purchasing information, available to our affiliates (for example, Hollister Co., abercrombie kids, and Gilly Hicks) and other unaffiliated companies for their marketing purposes.
Please be aware that we may use third parties to assist us with our Website, our e-commerce business, and our Social Media Pages. Some examples of the assistance that may be provided by third party service providers are: fulfilling orders (including, but not limited to, processing payments, providing fraud prevention services, and verifying addresses); providing electronic online investor information; monitoring and analyzing site activity; your actions in response to our emails; conducting surveys, administering and maintaining employment application information; and administering emails, promotions, sweepstakes or contests. It is possible that some of these service providers will be located outside of the United States.
You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Websites, the Websites or the public.
If Abercrombie & Fitch were ever merged with or acquired by another entity, or if it acquires another business entity or is involved in a corporate reorganization or other change of control, some or all of the personal information collected about you could be shared with this entity, and may also be retained by Abercrombie & Fitch. Other than this acquisition, sale, or reorganization, we do not sell or rent your email address to unrelated third parties.
Cookies
1. What Are Cookies, Pixel Tags and URL Links, and How Are These Used on Our Websites or in Our Emails?
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may use, a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive. The information collected when visiting our Websites may include the following: an IP address, the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Websites; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account or sign into an account and where you go on our Websites once signed into your account; whether you complete a transaction; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of our Websites, your specific interaction with our Websites and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Websites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Websites by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, our Websites use cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited one of our Websites in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on one of our Websites. Our Websites also use cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our Websites. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may also use, Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Website and in emails. A Pixel Tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Webpage or email message. Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Websites. Pixel Tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with our Websites as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Websites and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
In addition, our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites and we may collect information related to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.
Opt Out
To make it easier for you, we have moved your opt-out preference choices to this section of the privacy policy.
Collection of Mobile Device Location Information. Your mobile device may allow you to disable location services on your device, which will prevent our Websites from accessing your mobile device location information. For specific questions regarding disabling your device’s location services, we recommend you review the specific instructions provided for your mobile device. 
Email. You can choose the frequency at which you receive marketing emails or unsubscribe if you no longer want to receive marketing emails from Abercrombie & Fitch, or our affiliated companies (like Hollister Co. or Gilly Hicks).  To unsubscribe from Abercrombie & Fitch go to the unsubscribe page, or to unsubscribe from our affiliated companies if you created an account, go to the email and phone page within the “My Account” section of the Websites, click on “manage your marketing preferences’, and select the option to no longer receive emails in the drop down menus for each brand, and press ‘SUBMIT.’ Please be aware, however, even if you request to limit the frequency you can receive marketing emails or to be removed from our email marketing list, you may still receive email confirmations for any orders placed on our Websites. 
Postal Marketing. If you no longer wish to receive marketing materials from Abercrombie & Fitch via regular postal mail, please email us at Privacy_Policy@Abercrombie.com and tell us in your comments that you want to be removed from the Abercrombie & Fitch postal mailing list, including the postal address you wish to have removed.
Third-Party Postal Address Sharing. If you would like to make sure that we do not disclose your name and postal mailing address to unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, please email us at Privacy_Policy@Abercrombie.com and ask us not to share your postal address with unaffiliated companies, including the postal address.
Information We Collect If you Apply for a Job or Attend Casting Calls
If you want to work for us, you can submit a curriculum vitae or resume online or fill out an employment application online. When you fill in an online employment application, we will collect personal data such as your name and contact details. We will use this information to evaluate you as a candidate for the position that you applied for and to contact you about the position.
We invite our employees who are interested in becoming a model to attend casting calls. If you would like to attend one of our casting calls, we may ask you to electronically send us information such as your statistics and age and to provide us with photographs or video footage of you. We may share this information and media with the modeling agency that we engage to assist us in determining whether we are interested in you becoming a model.
If you electronically send us information about your interest in being a model for us (such as your name, size stats, work information, contact information, photographs and video), we will only use that information to determine whether we are interested in you being an Abercrombie & Fitch model and to contact you about prospective modeling.
International Users
If you are visiting one of our Websites from a location outside of the United States, please keep in mind that it is a US based web and/or commerce site. This privacy policy governs the information collected by or on behalf of our Websites irrespective of where you are located when you access it, browse it, interact with it, and make purchases through it (including those that are shipped to addresses outside the US). With respect to personal information you provide to Abercrombie & Fitch on the Social Media Pages, once received from the social media sites, it is maintained and processed by us on servers and internal systems located in the United States. This means your personal information may be stored outside of the province, state, and/or country in which you reside, and processed by us, an affiliate or a third party service provider as described in this privacy policy. Moreover, governmental bodies that have jurisdiction over us in the United States (e.g., courts and law enforcement agencies) may be entitled to access your personal information.
Updating Personal Information in Your Account
If you have created an online account we prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your personal information, including your billing address, preferred shipping information, payment details, and contact information. Just log-on to your account with your email address and password, and you will see an overview page where you can update your information.
Privacy of Children
Websites that link to this privacy policy are not directed at kids under the age of 13, and no one under the age of 13 should provide personal information on these Websites. We encourage all children under the age of 13 to visit our kids' Website at http: abercrombiekids.com.
Links
For your convenience and enjoyment, our Websites may contain links to other websites. We do not evaluate and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We would urge you to review the privacy policies on each link to ensure that you are comfortable with their privacy policies and practices.
Updates to Privacy Policy
As we continue to offer you new and different types of content and services, we may modify our information collection, use, or disclosure practices. Should there be a material change to our information collection, use or disclosure practices, it will be applied only to information collected on a going forward basis, and we will update this privacy policy statement.
Security Statement
Abercrombie & Fitch limits the number of employees that have access to the databases that contain personal data, and Abercrombie & Fitch employees are advised of the importance of confidentiality. In addition, it is our policy to never send your payment card number via email.
We designed our online store to accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Browsers that do not meet this requirement will be prevented from navigating the online store section of our Websites. See "Supported Web Browsers" for more information. While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
Supported Web Browsers
We support the following Web browsers: Mozilla Firefox 3.0+, Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0+, Google Chrome 14.0+, and Apple Safari 4.0+. Additionally, some of the site content requires Adobe Flash Player 9.0 or later.
