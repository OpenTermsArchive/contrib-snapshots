COM PRIVACY POLICY Last Updated: November 16, 2010 On November 16, 2010, we launched Meebo Alpha, which introduced a variety of new features to Meebo.
We took this opportunity to update our privacy policy to take into account these new features and to reorganize the policy to make it easier to use.
If you had a Meebo account prior to that date and you don't sign up for Meebo Alpha, we will not use the data you previously provided to Meebo in a manner that is materially different from our prior privacy policy.
What this Privacy Policy covers This Privacy Policy applies to all of the websites and services offered by Meebo, including those listed here, Meebo Alpha and the Meebo MiniBar.
By visiting or using Meebo, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, products or services that are not owned or operated by Meebo or to actions taken by Meebo users.
For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites where the Meebo Bar appears, to third-party applications that are available through Meebo, or to any social networks or IM service providers that you associate with your Meebo account, all of which are governed by their own privacy policies.
Information that Meebo collects Personally identifiable information Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to determine your personal identity, such as your name or email address.
When you create an account we ask for your name and email address.
If you link your third-party instant messaging (IM) accounts to your Meebo account, we may also collect your user name for that account, which is also considered personally identifiable information.
Optional profile data Meebo gives you the opportunity to update your public profile with information about yourself such as your photo, your hometown, your website and a short biography.
This information is public as described under "What is public and what is private?" Information from the accounts you link to Meebo If you connect your Meebo account to your third-party IM accounts or your social network accounts (e.
g.
, Facebook and Twitter), they may send us information about you, including your name, username at those services, Unique User ID ("UUID") for those services, friends list, status, profile information, age and gender.
Demographic data Meebo asks for your age and gender at registration and may collect additional demographic information about you, such as your location and interests.
Meebo may receive this information from you or from outside sources, such as websites where the Meebo Bar is present, ad networks and other providers, or we may make assumptions based on the other information that we collect.
Log data When you use Meebo via a browser, mobile application or other application, like most other websites we automatically collect information about you and your activity (known as "log data"), including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser or device type, your mobile device ID, your interactions with Meebo, your interactions with third party IM and social networks through Meebo, your geographic region and Meebo cookies associated with your browser.
If you visit a site that has the Meebo Bar, we also collect information about the website or web page that you view and your interactions with that site.
If you are using the MiniBar, we do not record the websites you visit unless you interact with the MiniBar on that site.
Meebo stores and uses this log data based on an anonymous identifier, except as described under "Check-in and sharing.
" Check-in and sharing We store your Meebo check-in activity, including the sites you check in to, your VIP status, and the people you follow and who follow you.
We also retain information about the web pages, photos, files, or other data that you share through the sharing functionality of Meebo.
This information is associated with your Meebo account.
Your communications Meebo offers users various communication tools, including instant messaging and Meebo Rooms.
For more information about Meeboâs collection and storage of your communications see "Meebo's communications platforms.
" Email address of friends you invite If you use the Meebo feature that allows you to invite friends to use Meebo, we will ask for your friend's email address but we will only use it to send them the invitation.
What is public and what is private? Public information Many features of Meebo, such as Meebo profiles and check-ins, are designed to be a public experience in order to allow people with similar interests to find each other and share the websites that they are visiting.
This section describes which information is public.
Public information is available to everyone on the Internet and can be viewed, copied, indexed, transferred and searched.
Your profile and check-in activity.
Your Meebo public profile and all of the information on it, including your picture, your check-in activity and the people you follow and who follow you on Meebo, are all public.
Click here for more information on the privacy settings for Meebo public profiles and check-ins.
Your username will also be part of your public profile URL (your Meebo profile web address) and will also be displayed to users you follow.
Because of the way the Internet works, when you or other users click on a link from your public profile page, the website that you go to or the advertisements that you click on will also receive the URL that you are coming from, which includes your user name (known as the âreferrer URLâ).
Your activity in Meebo Rooms or on Meebo message boards.
Your communications in Meebo Rooms are logged and can be seen by anyone the user who created the Meebo Room has allowed to access the Meebo Room, which may be everyone.
Your postings on Meebo message boards are public.
Private Information The following information is not made available as part of your public profile or otherwise made public by Meebo: your age and gender your email address your third-party IM account user names your third-party IM account buddies or third-party (e.
g.
, Facebook) social network friends your IM communications your log data Meebo's communication platforms Meebo offers users the ability to communicate with each other through IM, through chat rooms known as Meebo Rooms and on the Meebo message boards.
Never disclose personal information about yourself in a public area like Meebo Rooms or the message boards.
Don't share personal information in a private IM unless it's someone you know well in the real world.
When you create a Meebo account, your preferences are set to enable all Meebo users to send you an IM, but only people who you follow can see if you are online.
You can change those settings by logging into your Meebo account and clicking on "Settings".
Your preferences are also automatically set to store your IM history on Meebo's servers.
You can view or delete your IM history by clicking on the IM history icon in your chat window.
You can turn off the IM history feature in your Meebo Messenger account under "Preferences.
" Keep in mind that even if you elect not to store your IM history, the person that you're chatting with may be storing your conversation, either on Meebo, on their IM network's servers or on their own computers.
By using Meebo, you consent to the storage of your IM history on Meebo as the default option and to the storing of your IM history by other users with whom you are chatting or by the Third Party IM Service that you or your friend is using.
For more information about IM history features and settings, please see Meebo's support documentation.
Meebo may customize the advertising shown to users based on software analysis of IM chat or Meebo Room conversations.
