<p>
<em>Do Not Track Mechanisms</em>
<br> We do not respond to Web browser 'do not track' signals at this time.  We await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.  We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes by going to <u>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</u> or <u>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</u>
</p>
<p>
<em>IP Addresses</em>
<br> An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that deliver Web pages to your browser.
Collecting your IP address allows us to gather useful information and data about our customers' use of the site, such as the Web pages viewed on <u>www.avis.com</u>.</p>
<p> ABG collects IP addresses for the purposes of: helping us diagnose problems with our main computers, for system administration, to report aggregated information to our business partners, and to audit the use of our Website.
When users request Web pages from our Web Site, our Web servers log the User's IP address.
We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user will remain anonymous to us.
For example, we collect and/or track the home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used by you to access this Web Site.
Such collection and tracking information is gathered by us as you navigate through our Websites, and will be used by us for our business purposes only.</p>
<p> In select instances, we may use IP addresses to help us identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Website <u>Terms of Use</u> or to protect our service, site, users or others.
</p>
<p> We also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This additional  information may include browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We do not link this automatically collected data to information we collect about you.</p>
<p>
<em>Third Party Use of Technology</em>
<br> We may use third-party servicing technology and service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our Websites.
They may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Websites, and your interaction with our products and services.
They may also use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to send you targeted advertisements for goods and services.
This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, or similar technology which is industry standard technology used by most major websites.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this non-personally identifiable information used, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp<u> or http://preferences-mgr.truste.com</u>.<br> We may also share Website usage information about visitors to our Websites with selected third parties for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on our Websites and other websites.
To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our third-party ad server on our Site.
In connection therewith, such third parties may have access to and use non-personalized information about your online usage activity.
The use of advertising cookies and web beacons sent by such third-party Web servers is standard for commercial activity in the Internet industry.
<u>Get more information about our third-party ad server, its use of cookies and how to opt-out.</u>
</p>
<p>
<em>Web Beacons</em>
<br> Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon that allows a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
We are currently partnering with Yahoo! who utilizes web beacons in the following ways: <br> Yahoo! uses web beacons to conduct research on behalf of certain partners on their websites and also for auditing purposes.</p>
<p> Information recorded through these web beacons is used to report aggregate information about Yahoo! users to our partners.
This aggregate information may include demographic and usage information.
No PII about you is shared with partners from this research.</p>
<p> When conducting research, Yahoo!'s practice is to require their partners to disclose the presence of these web beacons on their pages in their privacy policies and state what choices are available to users regarding the collection and use of this information.
You may choose to <u>opt-out</u> of Yahoo! using this information for this research.</p>
<p> Note: This opt-out applies to a specific browser rather than a specific user.
Therefore you will have to opt-out separately from each computer or browser that you use.<br> We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.</p>

<b>How We Protect the Security of Personally Identifiable Information </b>
<p>The security of your PII is important to us.
We exercise reasonable care in implementing generally accepted standards of security to protect your PII from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for some of your more sensitive PII (such as credit card information and state ID numbers).
It is our policy to retain PII for only as long as we believe appropriate for the purposes for which the PII was collected or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we take reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee that PII stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from unauthorized access.
By using our Websites and corresponding with us, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
<p> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account passcode, membership numbers and pin numbers, and you will be responsible for any access to or use of our Websites by you or any person or entity using a passcode provided to you, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee, relative or agent.
