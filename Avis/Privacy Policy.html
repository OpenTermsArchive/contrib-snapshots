INDEPENDENT LOCATIONS</b>
</p>
<p>Many Avis and Budget locations are independently owned and operated.
Each of these locations collects, uses and discloses personal information for its own purposes.
ABG does not control the independent licensee’s or franchisee’s use of this personal information.
Please ask to review the privacy notice for that location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you are dealing with an independent location, the licensee or franchisee is responsible for collecting and processing payment and may engage in its own e-mail campaigns and other forms of marketing to you.
ABG is not responsible for the compliance of the independent location with privacy laws.
However, if you believe the independent location is violating privacy laws, you may report this to ABG’s Global Privacy Office at ABGprivacy@avisbudget.com.</p>
