PROTECTION OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form.

While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Sites reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.
Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and AOL's browser, with the objective that only we can read a customer's personally identifiable information.
We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personally identifiable information.

We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it.
In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES The Sites may contain links to third party websites.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites even if you access those using links from our Sites.
Your use of these third party websites is entirely at your own risk and we recommend that you check the privacy and security policy of each website you visit.
Clicking on a third party link will essentially take you to a third party’s website.
