                therein, are and will remain with Provider, its Affiliates and the respective rights holders in the

                of the foregoing, Customer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Provider an assignment of
                all right, title and interest in and to the Resultant Data, including all Intellectual Property Rights

                irrevocably grants all such rights and permissions in or relating to Customer Data to Provider, its
                Affiliates, Subcontractors and the Provider Personnel as are necessary or useful to (a) perform the
                Services; (b) enforce this Agreement and exercise its rights and perform its hereunder; and (c) improve
                the services and products of Provider and its Affiliates.

            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feedback</span>. Customer and Authorized Users may from time
                to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback (“<span class="textBold">Feedback</span>”) to
                Provider and its Affiliates with
                respect to services and products of Provider and its Affiliates. Customer agrees that all Feedback is
                and shall be given entirely voluntarily. To the extent Customer provides any Feedback to Provider or its
                Affiliates, Customer hereby assigns to Provider and its Affiliates all right, title and interest therein
                and thereto, including all Intellectual Property Rights and other proprietary rights therein. To the
                extent the foregoing assignment is ineffective, Customer hereby grants to Provider and its Affiliates
                (without obligation or compensation to Customer, or restriction of any kind or nature) a worldwide,
                non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully paid up license to use, disclose, reproduce,
                license or otherwise distribute, and exploit Feedback as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or
                restriction of any kind on account of Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise. Customer shall not give
                Feedback that is subject to license terms that seek to require any Provider product, technology, service
                or documentation incorporating or derived from Feedback, or any Provider’s or its Affiliates’
                Intellectual Property Rights, to be licensed or otherwise shared with any third party. For the avoidance
                of doubt, Customer agrees and acknowledges that the incorporation by Provider and its Affiliates of any
                Feedback into any Provider products and/or services does not grant Customer any proprietary rights in or
                to any such products and/or services.

                has contractual or other confidentiality obligations, in each case whether or not marked, designated or

                Disclosing Party waives compliance or, after providing the notice and assistance required under this
                <span class="textBold">Section 9.4</span>, the Receiving Party remains required by Law to disclose any
                Confidential Information, the
                Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the
                Confidential Information that the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, on the Disclosing
                Party's request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from the applicable

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span>. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly
                and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting Provider. In the unlikely event that Provider is unable
                to resolve a complaint to Customer’s satisfaction, Customer and Provider agree to resolve those disputes
                through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
                Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
                judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
                courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under
                this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
                permitted.

                        are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This
                        Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act
                        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall
                        survive termination of this Agreement.

                        A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
                        written Notice of Dispute. The Notice of Dispute to Provider should be addressed to: Ubiquiti Inc., 
                      	Customer Arbitration Demand, 685 Third Ave, 27th Fl, New York, NY 10017 with a
                        copy sent to <a href="mailto:legal@ui.com">legal@ui.com</a>. The Notice of Dispute must (a) describe the nature and basis of the

                        class="textBold">Demand</span>"). If Provider and
                        Customer do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice of
                        Dispute is received, Customer or Provider may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                        arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Provider or Customer shall not be
                        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which
                        Customer or Provider is entitled.

                        ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN
                        THE PARTIES, SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, CONDUCTED BY THE JUDICIAL
                        ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION SERVICE (JAMS) (OR THEIR SUCCESSOR). If JAMS is unavailable, the
                        parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The
                        arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                        except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for
                        the court to decide. Unless Customer and Provider agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
                        take place in New York, New York. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
                        conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                        essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If, however, the arbitrator
                        finds that either the substance of Customer’s claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
                        frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
                        Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), Customer agrees to reimburse Provider for its reasonable costs
                        and expenses related to the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to JAMS filings,
                        administration, arbitrator and other related fees.

                    <li>
                        The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking
                        relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual
                        claim. CUSTOMER AND PROVIDER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS
                        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both Customer and Provider agree otherwise, the
                        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over
                        any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any
                        of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only
                        that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.

                fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party shall have authority to contract for or
                bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Announcements</span>. Neither party shall issue or
                release any announcement, statement, press release or other publicity or marketing materials relating to
                this Agreement or otherwise use the other party's trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain
                names or other indicia of source, affiliation or sponsorship, in each case, without the prior written
                consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
                provided, however, that Provider may, without Customer's consent, include Customer's name in its lists
                of Provider's current or former customers of Provider in promotional and marketing materials.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notices</span>. Notices sent will be deemed effectively given:
                (a) when received, if delivered by hand, with signed confirmation of receipt; (b) when received, if sent
                by a nationally recognized overnight courier, signature required; (c) when sent, if by facsimile or
                e-mail, if sent during the addressee's normal business hours, and on the next business day, if sent

            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interpretation</span>. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the
                words “include,” “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”;
                (b) the word “or” is not exclusive; (c) the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto” and “hereunder”
                refer to this Agreement as a whole; (d) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used
                in the plural, and vice-versa; and (e) words denoting any gender include all genders. Unless the context
                otherwise requires, references in this Agreement: (x) to sections, exhibits, schedules, attachments and
                appendices mean the sections of, and exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices attached to, this
                Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other
                document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
                provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes
                any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties intend this
                Agreement to be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
                interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. Any
                exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices referred to herein are an integral part of this
                Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Headings</span>. The headings in this Agreement are for
                reference only and do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Entire Agreement</span>. This Agreement, together with any
                other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the
                parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and
                contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with
                respect to such subject matter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assignment</span>. Customer shall not assign or otherwise
                transfer any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance,
                under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise,
                without Provider's prior written consent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting
                its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Customer (regardless of whether
                Customer is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations
                or performance under this Agreement for which Provider's prior written consent is required. No
                delegation or other transfer will relieve Customer of any of its obligations or performance under this
                Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this <span class="textBold">Section 16.8</span>
                is void.
                This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
                permitted successors and assigns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Third-party Beneficiaries</span>. This Agreement is for the
                sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
                herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
                right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment and Modification; Waiver</span>. Customer may not
                amend or modify this Agreement without Provider’s prior written consent. No waiver by any party of any
                of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing. Except as otherwise
                set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power
                or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall
                any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or
                further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Severability</span>. If any provision of this Agreement is
                invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
                shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable
                such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
                provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
                modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
                mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
                originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction</span>. This
                Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
                without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit
                the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of New York. All disputes
                arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in
                accordance with <span class="textBold">Section 15</span>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
                any court order or injunctive
                relief, the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts in
                New York County, State of New York, USA, with respect to which, to the extent permitted under applicable
                law, the parties: (a) agree that any action, suit or proceeding relating directly or indirectly to this
                Agreement will be tried by a judge without a jury; and (b) hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any
                such action, suit or proceeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equitable Relief</span>. Each party acknowledges and agrees
                that a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its obligations under <span class="textBold">Section 9</span>
                or, in the
                case of Customer, <span class="textBold">Section 3.3</span>, <span class="textBold">Section 3.4</span>,
                <span class="textBold">Section 4.3</span>, or <span class="textBold">Section 8</span>s, would cause the
                other party
                irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the
                event of such breach or threatened breach, the other party will be entitled to equitable relief,
                including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
                available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual
                damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in
                addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attorneys' Fees</span>. In the event that any action, suit, or
                other legal or administrative proceeding is instituted or commenced by either party hereto against the
                other party arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
                reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revisions; Continued Use</span>. Provider reserves the right
                to change any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including any document
                incorporated herein by reference, at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes will be effective
                upon the earlier to occur of: (a) emailing the revised terms and conditions or notice of such changes to
                Customer at Customer’s email address; or (b) posting the revised terms and conditions on Provider’s
                website. Customer is responsible for reviewing any revised terms, conditions, policies, guidelines and
                information and any notices of revisions. CUSTOMER’S CONTINUED USE OF SERVICES FOLLOWING THE EMAILING OR
                POSTING OF ANY REVISED TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY NOTICE OF SUCH REVISIONS, WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE
                OF THE REVISED TERMS AND CONDITIONS BY CUSTOMER. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES TO THIS
                AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER MUST STOP ACCEPTING SERVICES FROM PROVIDER, AND PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO PROVIDER
                IMMEDIATELY.
            </li>
          	<li>
              	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government End User</span>. If Customer is a U.S. government entity or if this Agreement otherwise becomes subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Customer acknowledges that elements of the Services constitute software and documentation and are provided as “Commercial Items” as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and are being licensed to U.S. government Customers as commercial computer software subject to restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, 12.211 and 12.212.

            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedules</span>. Customer will comply with this Agreement and
                the terms, conditions, policies and guidelines, rules and other information attached as schedules
                hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent there is a conflict between this
