Information collected through browser add-ons.
If you use a privacyscore browser add-on in the default mode, your browser will ask our server to provide a privacyscore for each page that you visit.
Your request may transmit the URL of the page you are viewing, but this is not stored by us.
No cookie or other identifier is placed on your computer, and your IP address is not stored.
You have the option to participate anonymously in the privacyscore panel and send tracking data to us to make privacyscores better.
When this option is enabled, the add-on will scan each page that you visit for tracking companies, and send data relating to tracking interactions to our database.
No cookie or other identifier is placed on your computer.
Our system may receive an IP address when the add-on requests scores or transmits tracking data.
We use IP addresses to screen out invalid transmissions, so we can ensure the quality of privacyscore results.
Our systems are designed so that IP addresses cannot be associated with browsing history information.
The add-on does not operate and does not send data when you are in incognito or private browsing mode.
