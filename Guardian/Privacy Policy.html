<strong>About our advertising</strong>
<p>In late 2005 we launched a new advertising service called Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA).
OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to visitors to our website.
OBA works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and your interaction with the site, and delivering adverts which we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>As you browse our sites some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in.
</p>
<p>This information we collect about behaviour on your computer enables us to group it with computers that show similar behaviour.
We can then display advertising to your computer which is based on these interests.
For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles we may decide to show you more adverts for food and drink.
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we employ uses or requires us to collect information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.
</p>
<p>We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners.
This may mean that when you are on other websites you are served advertising based on your behaviour on guardian.co.uk and guardiannews.com, and on guardian.co.uk and guardiannnews.com you may be served advertising based on your behaviour on other sites.</p>
<p>Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on browsing patterns and interactions with the site away from our sites.
For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing.
This is allows companies to advertise to website visitors who leave their website without making a purchase.
The privacy policy of criteo, one of the partners that we work with for behavioural retargeting is here: criteo.com/en/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites.
It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about OBA and how to opt out of it, please visit youronlinechoices.com or networkadvertising.org (if accessing from the US.)</p>
<p>Please visit audiencescience.com/privacy.asp and quantcast.com/privacy for the privacy policy of our online behavioural targeting technology providers.</p>
