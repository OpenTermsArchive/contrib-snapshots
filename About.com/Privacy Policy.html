This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users' own computers.
Cookies can be used to store sign-in credentials so that you don't have to enter them each time you return to a Web site, or to store other information to make web viewing more customized or efficient upon future visits.
Cookies also may store a unique identifier tied to your computer so that web services and advertising networks can recognize you across visits to different websites.
You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse all or certain cookies completely.
<br>
<br>We (or our partners) may use or support cookies as follows: <ul>
<li>To collect information about your browsing activities in order to deliver customized or relevant services, advertising or content to you;</li>
<li>To relate the information collected by cookies to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources;</li>
<li>To work with third parties that serve advertisements (through our Services or across the Internet) or provide other services to us, such as providing users the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content, or tracking site usage statistics.
We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Other Local Storage.</b> We (or our partners) may use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.

<li>
<b>Web Beacons.</b> We (or our partners) may use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server.
Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.
These web beacons may be used for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</li>
