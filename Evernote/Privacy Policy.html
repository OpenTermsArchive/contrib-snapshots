 Privacy Policy <p>
<strong>Effective Date: January 6, 2014</strong> - What’s new »</p>
<p>Evernote values your privacy in your personal information and your Content that you store in our Service.
This Privacy Policy explains what information Evernote Corporation and its affiliated companies (together, “Evernote” or “we” and sometimes “us”) collect about you and why, what we may do with that information and how we handle your Content.</p> What Is The Scope Of This Privacy Policy?
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Evernote Terms of Service, and applies to the information obtained by us through your use of this website, the Service and other Evernote products and services, including the Evernote Market.
Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided for those terms in the Terms of Service.</p> Will This Privacy Policy Ever Change?
<p>As Evernote evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in the Service, our business and laws applicable to us and you.
we will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy.
We will post any revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy to find area of our web site, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes.
We will ask for your consent to such changes if required by applicable law.
in other cases, please note that your continuation of your Evernote Service account after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy.
If you disagree with any changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy, you will need to close your account.</p> I.
Information Collection and Use What Information Does Evernote Collect About Me and Why?
<p>We collect very little personal information about our users.
A list of the “Personal Information” Evernote may collect, and why we collect it, follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your username, email address, and contact preferences.
This lets us create your account, provide you with convenient and personalized access to your account, and deliver and support the Service.
This information also helps us communicate with you about your use of the Service, product announcements, software updates and orders you have placed in the Evernote Market, as well as respond to your requests for assistance (including providing account verification support if you’re having difficultly accessing your account).
In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing emails and special offers.
For more information, please see the section below entitled, “Will Evernote Send Me Emails?”</li>
<li>For Premium users and customers of the Market, your information required to complete a commercial transaction on our site.
We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction.</li>
<li>The geographic area where you use your computer and mobile devices (as indicated by an IP address or similar identifier), and the language you select when interacting with the Evernote Service.
We collect this information in order to help us deliver and support the Service, including by localizing your Evernote Service experience.
It also helps us improve our understanding of how our users use the Service.</li>
<li>The Evernote products and services you use.
This information helps us deliver and support the Service and respond to your requests for assistance.
We also collect this information to improve our understanding of how our users use the Service and engage with the Evernote Market.</li>
<li>Any Content you add to your account.
We don’t use this information for any purpose other than to make sure it is available to you when you use the Service.</li>
<li>For purchases of physical goods from the Evernote Market, a shipping address and, in certain cases, contact information.
We use this information to deliver the purchased products to you or your intended recipient.</li>
<li>A unique device identifier (for example, an IMEI or SIM number or other identifier) for hardware using Evernote software.
If you redeem or activate a promotion (which may be included in a coupon, gift card or Evernote Points), we use this information to process such promotions and to provide account verification support if you’re having difficultly accessing your Evernote Service account.
In addition, when you use your device to access our Service, your device provides a unique identifier that we combine with a human-readable description of the device (e.g., “My iPad”) in order to show you (on your account’s Access History page) which applications are authorized to access your Evernote Service account and date of last access.
The device identifier varies by platform.
We also use this information to calculate anonymous, aggregate statistics on the number of unique devices using the Evernote Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evernote’s web site and applications also collect and receive information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform within your account, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see our Cookie Information Page for more information).
When you access the Evernote Service or Evernote Market via an Evernote Software application, that application will request access to certain information on your computing device.
For more information on these application permissions, please visit our Data Usage page.</p>
<p>Gathering this kind of information helps us administer the Service and the Evernote Market, provide convenient and personalized user access, improve the features and usability of our products and Service, analyze user trends and information about users’ use of our Service (including the extent to which our users share or make public notes and notebooks), collect information about use and growth of the Service in specific regions, and evaluate the content and organization of our site.</p>
<p>We do not collect information about you to deliver any targeted advertising to you, or track your visits to any third-party websites.
However, when you use our Web Clipper or Clearly browser extensions to view and/or save content from third-party websites, we will keep a record of the source website for you.
This source-recording functionality will not be affected by your browser’s do-not-track settings.</p>
<p>In addition, we automatically gather non-personally identifiable information that indicates your association with one of our business partners or certain promotions.
We use this information to determine the amount of revenue share payments to make to partners with whom we might have such arrangements and to provide anonymized aggregate reports.</p> Tell Me More About The Tracking Information Evernote Collects?
<p>Evernote uses cookies and tracking pixels to collect information that helps us provide our Service to you.
For more information about these uses and your options, please visit our Cookie Information Page.</p> What Is Evernote’s Approach to Information Collected From Children?
<p>Evernote does not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent and, if we learn that we have inadvertently done so in violation of local laws prohibiting collection of information from children without such consent, we will promptly delete it.
For more information on Evernote’s approach to children’s use of the Service and our compliance with the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), please see the section of our Terms of Service entitled, “Can Kids Use Evernote?”</p> Will Evernote Send Me Emails?

Information Access and Disclosure Does Evernote Share My Personal Information or Content?
<p>Evernote is not in the business of selling or renting user information, and we only disclose information when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your explicit consent to share the information.</li>
<li>We need to share your information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers who process data on our behalf and subject to strict data protection requirements.</li>
<li>We need to share your information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers to fulfill your product or service requests, including sales, delivery and support for certain products from the Evernote Market.</li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service, to enforce those Terms of Service, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service.</li>
<li>We determine that the access, preservation or disclosure of information is required or permitted by law to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Evernote and users of the Service, or is required to comply with applicable laws, including compliance with warrants, court orders or other legal process.</li>
<li>We need to do so in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of our business, as permitted by applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some third-party applications and services that work with our Service may ask for permission to access your Content or other information about your account.
Those applications will provide you with notice and request your consent in order to obtain such access or information.
Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.
We encourage you to review each party’s privacy policy.
To learn more about some of these applications and what data they may access, click herevisit the 3rd Party App Permissions page.</p>
<p>Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on the Service, such as Facebook “Like” buttons on evernote.com, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited our website, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services.
For more information with additional examples, see the “Social Media Features” section of our Cookie Information Page.</p> Does Evernote Review My Notes?
<p>As a rule, Evernote employees do not monitor or view your personal information or Content stored in the Service, but it may be viewed if we believe our Terms of Service have been violated and confirmation is required, if we need to do so in order to respond to your requests for user support, or we otherwise determine that we have an obligation to review it as described in our Terms of Service.
Your Notes also may be viewed where necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Evernote and its users, or in order to comply with our legal obligations, such as responding to warrants, court orders or other legal process.</p> Does Evernote Ever Make Any of My Personal Information or Content Public?
<p>No.
Note, however, that certain portions of the Evernote web sites and Service, such as user notebooks designated as “public” and our user forum, are open to any online viewer.
Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages.
Evernote enables you to determine whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, so you should carefully consider how you use the services.
Evernote is not responsible for any publication or use of any Personal Information you choose to post in these locations.</p> III.
Data Storage and Transfer
Where Is My Data Stored?
<p>When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable clients, Content you save will be stored locally on that device.
When you synch your computing device with the Service, that Content will be replicated on our servers, which are located in the United States.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Personal Information and Content submitted to Evernote will be transferred to a data center in the United States.
If you post information to the Evernote sites you are confirming your consent to such information, including Personal Information and Content, being hosted and accessed in the United States.</p>
<p>Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from those in the United States, but Evernote complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information collected not only from those users residing in the European Union and Switzerland, but from all our users.
We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.
To learn more about the Safe Harbor programs, and to view our certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p> A Special Note to Users in the European Union and Switzerland
<p>If you live in Switzerland or the European Union, please note that not only is Switzerland-based Evernote GmbH the data controller for all information associated with your Evernote Service account, but Evernote GmbH is also the data controller for any payment, order, shipping and other information you provide when you purchase an item from the Evernote Market, even though such orders will be placed with and fulfilled by U.S.-based Evernote Corporation, as described in our Commercial Terms.</p> A Special Note to Customers of the Evernote Market in Japan
<p>If you live in Japan and are a customer of the Evernote Market, please note that Evernote GmbH is the data controller for all information associated with your Evernote Service account, but Evernote GmbH also has a contractual relationship with a third party reseller for the Japan market permitting joint use of your personal information with that third party (including addresses, names, telephone numbers, email address, credit card information, as well as the content of shopping transactions and customer support inquiries).
Information about our Japan reseller may be found at our Evernote Market FAQ.</p> How Can I Access or Correct Information Evernote Holds About Me?
<p>Users who wish to (i) access any Personal Information that we hold about you.
(ii) request that we correct or delete the Personal Information that we hold about you.
or (iii) request that we not use or stop using your Personal Information for marketing purposes may do so by contacting us at compliance AT evernote DOT com.
We will comply with such requests to the extent permitted or required by law.</p> How Secure Is My Data?
<p>Evernote is committed to protecting the security of your information and implements reasonable measures to do so.</p>
<p>We use industry standard encryption to protect your data in transit.
This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.</p>
<p>Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of administrative, physical and logical security safeguards.
The security of the information stored locally in the Evernote Software installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device.
We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use with our applications and service.</p>
<p>Evernote also provides users with the ability to encrypt segments of text within any given note.
You can learn how to encrypt text by reviewing this Knowledge Base article.
Please note, however, that Evernote does not have the ability to decrypt encrypted contents, so we won’t be able to help you recover encrypted contents if you forget the passphrase you used for encryption.</p> IV.
Information Deletion
What Happens If I Want to Stop Using Evernote?
<p>You can delete Content you have posted to any notebook at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote Service at any time.
If you delete information and material from a notebook and then sync your account, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service, but residual copies of your deleted Content may continue to exist on the Evernote Service’s back-up and archiving systems for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
If you cancel your account, the Content in your account will not be deleted unless you purposely delete that information, and sync your account before you cancel your account.
Learn how to effectively delete your Content hereLearn how to effectively delete your Content on our privacy section's Delete Data page.</p> What Happens If Evernote Closes My Account?
<p>If Evernote closes your Service account due to a Terms of Service violation, then you may contact Evernote to request deletion of your data, and Evernote will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.</p> V.
