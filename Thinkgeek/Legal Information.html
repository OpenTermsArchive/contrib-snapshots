Conditions for more information.</p> California Supply Chain Transparency Law <p>On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) ("Act") went into effect in the State of California.
Under the Act, large manufacturers and retailers are required to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking within their supply chains.
The Act's underlying purpose is to educate consumers, so they can make informed decisions and purchase goods from companies that responsibly manage their supply chains.</p>
<p>ThinkGeek, Inc.
("ThinkGeek") is committed to conducting its business on the principles of integrity and sound business ethics.
We are also committed to holding our manufacturers, vendors and suppliers to these same principles, which include taking measures to ensure that parties we do business with maintain basic labor and human rights standards for their workers.</p>
<p>To this end, ThinkGeek has a Code of Conduct to which each contract manufacturer for exclusive-branded products must adhere.
The Code of Conduct represents ThinkGeek's commitment to source this merchandise from persons and firms that strive to maintain comprehensive corporate responsibility programs and adhere to ThinkGeek's expectations regarding human trafficking, forced labor and a variety of other important issues.
Specifically, our Code of Conduct prohibits these manufacturers from utilizing any form of forced labor, whether in the form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise.
Manufacturers we contract with who fail to meet these standards would be in breach of our agreement.
We also require manufacturers we contract with to ensure their subcontractors adhere to our Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Members of our direct import and merchandising teams personally visit the factories where our ThinkGeek-branded products are produced.
In addition, we have in the past, and will continue to in the future, engage a third party to perform scheduled factory audits of our manufacturing vendors to ensure they are operating within the parameters of our Code of Conduct.
For those factories where licensed products are produced, the licensors also separately conduct factory audits for social compliance.
These audits will continue on a periodic basis for as long as we do business with each of these manufacturers.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, each contract manufacturer is required to independently maintain sufficient documentation of its compliance with our Code of Conduct.
ThinkGeek will quickly investigate any reports of human trafficking anywhere in its supply chain, and will take swift action against any supplier that is found to have acted improperly.
We require that these suppliers certify that all their operations are completely free of any form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all ThinkGeek employees, including those who maintain relationships with vendors, are required to adhere to the Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct.
The Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct requires all employees to observe high ethical standards in the performance of their jobs and in their relationships with customers, vendors, their community, and their coworkers.
Failure by an employee to follow the standards set forth in the Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct may subject such employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p> Need to Talk with Us about Something Urgent? <p> Our helpful Live Support Monkeys are here to help through live online chat.
