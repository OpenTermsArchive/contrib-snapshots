</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>b.
How We Will Bill You.
</strong>Unless you are subject to a minimum term arrangement, Service(s) are provided to you on a month-to-month basis.
<strong>If you are receiving Service(s) at a trial or introductory rate, you may cancel your Service(s) at the end of the trial or introductory period by calling your local Comcast customer service center.</strong> You will generally be billed monthly, in advance, for recurring service charges, equipment charges, and fees.
<strong>YOU MUST PAY, ON OR BEFORE THE DAY WE INSTALL ANY OR ALL OF THE SERVICE(S), THE FIRST MONTH’S SERVICE CHARGES, XFINITY EQUIPMENT CHARGES, ANY DEPOSITS, AND ANY INSTALLATION CHARGES.
</strong>Your first bill may include pro-rated charges from the date you first begin receiving Service(s), as well as monthly recurring charges for the next month and charges for non-recurring services you have received.
You may be billed for some Service(s) individually after they have been provided to you.
these include measured and per-call charges (as explained below) and charges for pay-per-view movies or events, interactive television, and e-commerce.
If you receive Service(s) under a promotion, after the promotional period ends, regular charges for the Service(s) will apply.<br>
We do not waive our rights to collect the full balance owed to us by accepting partial payment.
We will apply the partial payment to the outstanding charges in the amounts and proportions that we determine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For XFINITY Voice Customers.</strong> If you pay a flat monthly fee for your calling plan, that fee may not cover certain types of calls.
You will be billed for these excluded call types on a per-call basis (e.g., operator services) or a measured basis (e.g., international calls).<br> Generally, for billing purposes, a measured call begins when the call is answered by the called party or an automated answering device (such as an answering machine or fax machine).
it ends when one of the parties disconnects the call.
However, some providers (e.g., those involved in calls to foreign countries) charge for a completed call when the called party’s line rings or after a certain number of rings.
If such a provider charges Comcast, its affiliates, or suppliers as if your call were answered by the called party, Comcast will charge you for a completed call.
<br> Measured calls are recorded in whole minutes, with partial minutes rounded up to the next whole minute.
If the charge for a measured call or for taxes or surcharges includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
  See //www.xfinity.com/voice/terms-of-service for information on per-call charges and the timing of measured-call charges.<br> If your usage charges for XFINITY Voice exceed typical residential usage charges, we may: (i) require you to make advance payments for XFINITY Voice, which we may offset against any unpaid balance on your account.
(ii) establish a credit limit for usage charges for XFINITY Voice and/or features.
and/or (iii) restrict XFINITY Voice or features.
If you exceed your credit limit, we reserve the right to suspend XFINITY Voice and require payment for usage charges assessed to your account.
<br> Our paper bills for XFINITY Voice contain only a summary of charges.
Detailed information is available for a limited period at a password-protected portion of our website.
You may call 1-800-XFINITY for a paper copy of outbound toll call records related to your most recent bill.
There may be an additional charge for these paper copies except as otherwise required by applicable law.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>c.
Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility.</strong> You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party service providers such as accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet or interactive options on your XFINITY Video Service that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us.
You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes.
In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.</p>
<p>
<strong>d.
Alternative Billing Arrangements.
</strong>Comcast may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party.
Any such third-party charges shall be payable pursuant to any contract or other arrangement between you and the third party.
We will not be responsible for any dispute regarding these charges between you and any third party.
You must address all such disputes directly with the third party.</p>
<p>
<strong>e.
Payment by Credit Card or Check.
</strong>If you use a credit card to pay for the Service(s), use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
If Comcast does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand.
If you make payment by check, you authorize Comcast to collect your check electronically.
You agree that you may not amend or modify this Agreement with any restrictive endorsements (such as “paid in full”), or other statements or releases on or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by Comcast and any such notations shall have no legal effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>f.
Our Remedies if You Pay Late or Fail to Pay.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Late or Non-Payments:</strong> You may be billed fees, charges, and assessments related to late or non-payments if for any reason (a) Comcast does not receive payment for the Service(s) by the payment due date or (b) you pay less than the full amount due for the Service(s).
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Maryland Customers.
YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF 10% PER MONTH FOR ANY PAYMENT AMOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT, EXCEPT IN GARRETT AND ALLEGANY COUNTIES AND HANCOCK, MD.

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties:</strong> Comcast does not anticipate that you will fail to pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers.
Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments.
These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance: (a) whether you will pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, if ever.
(b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay.
and (c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Collection Costs:</strong> If we use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection.
These costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency’s fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and arbitration or court costs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Suspension/Disconnect: </strong>If you fail to pay the full amount due for any or all of the Service(s) then Comcast, at its sole discretion in accordance with and subject to applicable law, may suspend or disconnect any or all the Service(s) you receive.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>g.
Reconnection Fees and Related Charges.
</strong>If you resume Service(s) after any suspension, we may require you to pay a reconnection fee.
If you reinstate any or all Service(s) after disconnection, we may require you to pay an installation fee and/or service activation fee.
These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees.
Reconnection of the Service(s) is subject to our credit policies, this Agreement and applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>h.
Our Right to Make Credit Inquiries.
YOU AUTHORIZE COMCAST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING YOU TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES.</strong> Comcast will not discriminate in the application of its credit inquiries and deposit policy on the basis of race, color, sex, creed, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or marital status.
Any risk assessments conducted by either Comcast or its third party credit bureau will be done in conformance with the requirements of all applicable state or federal laws.</p>
<p>
<strong>i.
Your Responsibilities Concerning Billing Questions.</strong> Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a billing credit, you must contact Comcast within sixty (60) days of the date on the bill.
You waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within sixty (60) days.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Sacramento, California Customers.</strong>If there are any billing errors or other requests for credit, you must bring those to our attention within sixty (60) days of the time you receive the bill for which you are seeking correction, unless applicable law provides for a longer period which cannot be waived or otherwise modified.
We will investigate and respond to all complaints within five (5) business days of the receipt of the complaint.
In some cases, an investigation might require a search of historical records that could take up to 14 business days.
If you believe a payment was made which was not credited to your account, a copy of a cancelled check or money order may be required and the disputed amount will be set aside for up to fourteen (14) days while you gather that documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.
REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT</strong>
<br>
We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Service(s), if you add XFINITY Equipment and/or Service(s) or if you fail to pay any amounts when they are due.
If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service(s) or for any XFINITY Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Prince Georges, Maryland Customers.</strong>If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within thirty (30) days or your next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service(s) or for any XFINITY Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).

If you wish to have your voice-capable modem connected to your telephone Inside Wiring, you are advised to have a Comcast technician perform the installation.
To make that connection, we must first disconnect your telephone Inside Wiring from the network of your existing telephone provider, which may disable any services you receive from them.
If you install XFINITY Voice yourself (where self-installation is an option), you should connect the voice-capable modem to a cordless phone, not directly to your telephone Inside Wiring.

BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>a.
Purpose.</strong> If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with Comcast that cannot be resolved through an informal dispute resolution with Comcast, you or Comcast may elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court.
Arbitration means you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>
<strong>b.
Definitions.</strong> The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Comcast regarding any aspect of your relationship with Comcast, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision.
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.
As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Comcast” means Comcast and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.</p>
<p>
<strong>c.
Right to Opt Out.</strong> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST RECEIVE THIS AGREEMENT BY VISITING //WWW.xfinity.com/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT, OR BY MAIL TO COMCAST 1701 JOHN F.
KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.
YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND COMCAST ACCOUNT NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION.
YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMCAST OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE(S) TO YOU BY COMCAST.
IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED COMCAST OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.
</p>
<p>
<strong>d.
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</strong> If you or Comcast elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association - Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, 877-493-4185, www.adr.org under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association "AAA".</p>
<p>
<strong>e.
Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Because the Service(s) provided to you by Comcast concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, applicable federal law or the law of the state where you receive the service from Comcast may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes.
No state statute pertaining to arbitration shall be applicable under this Arbitration Provision.

</strong>In addition to the General Terms and Conditions above, the following terms and conditions are specifically applicable to XFINITY Voice Customers.<br>
<strong>1.
SPECIAL NOTICE FOR COMCAST DIGITAL VOICE SUBSCRIBERS: LIMITATIONS OF XFINITY VOICE SERVICE</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>a.
Limitations.</strong> XFINITY Voice includes 911/Enhanced 911 and certain plans include text-to-911 (where emergency authorities make such service available) functionality (collectively “911/E911”) that may differ from the 911/E911 functionality furnished by other providers.
As such, it may have certain limitations.
CAREFULLY READ THE INFORMATION BELOW.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT ANY LIMITATIONS OF 911/E911.
YOU AGREE TO CONVEY THESE LIMITATIONS TO ALL PERSONS WHO MAY PLACE CALLS OR TEXTS OVER THE SERVICES.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 911/E911, CALL 1-800-XFINITY</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>i.
Correct Address:</strong> In order for your 911/E911 calls to be properly directed to emergency services, Comcast must have your correct Premises address.
If you move XFINITY Voice to a different address without Comcast’s approval, 911/E911 calls may be directed to the wrong emergency authority, may transmit the wrong address, and/or XFINITY Voice (including 911/E911) may fail altogether.
Therefore, you must call 1-800-XFINITY before you move XFINITY Voice to a new address.
Comcast will need several business days to update your Premises address in the E911 system so that your 911/E911 calls can be properly directed.
All changes in service address require Comcast’s prior approval.
In order to utilize text-to-911 service, you must be eligible to use the XFINITY Connect Mobile Application (“XCMA”) and activate Voice 2go™, properly authenticated and logged into the XCMA using a supported mobile device and operating system, and connected to the Internet over a Wi-Fi or commercial mobile radio service network.
In order for text-to-911 (where emergency authorities make such service available) to be properly directed to emergency services, you must provide permission for the XCMA to request and receive your location from your mobile device’s operating system.</p>
<p>
<strong>ii.
Service Interruptions: </strong>XFINITY Voice uses the electrical power in your home.
If there is an electrical power outage, 911 calling may be interrupted if a battery backup in the associated voice-capable modem is not installed, fails, or is exhausted after several hours.
Furthermore, calls, including calls and texts to 911/E911, may not be completed if there is a problem with network facilities, including network congestion, network/equipment/power failure, or another technical problem.</p>
<p>
<strong>iii.
Suspension and Termination by Comcast: </strong>You understand and acknowledge that all XFINITY Voice, including 911/E911, as well as all online features of XFINITY Voice, where we make these features available, will be disabled if your account is suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>
<strong>iv.

Therefore, XFINITY Voice cannot accommodate the assignment of a telephone number outside of the telephone rate center to which that number is appropriately assigned.</p>
</blockquote>

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.</strong> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMCAST WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SERVICE OUTAGE, INABILITY TO DIAL OR TEXT 911 USING THE SERVICE(S), AND/OR INABILITY TO ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL.
YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS COMCAST AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, FINES, PENALTIES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES) BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER OF THE SERVICE(S) RELATING TO THE FAILURE OR OUTAGE OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO 911/E911.</p>

<strong>3. VOICE-CAPABLE MODEM BACKUP BATTERY<br>
</strong>If the voice-capable modem is equipped with a backup battery, such battery is used to provide service during a power outage to your home where power to Comcast’s network remains available.
