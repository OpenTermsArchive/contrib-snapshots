Detailed information is provided in the rules of the respective Game(s).

2.
15 The User has no right to retain the Games and/or Services of the version current at the time of the conclusion of the contract.
Bigpoint reserves the right to cease operation of individual Bigpoint Games and/or Services at any time without prior notice or justification.
At his or her own discrection, the User may request, in such an event, that fees paid in advance within the scope of continual obligations (e.
g.
for Premium memberships, subscriptions) be credited to his/her account for other Games and/or Services operated by Bigpoint, or that Bigpoint recompense all fees paid in advance.
The right does not apply to fees for services, which have been fully rendered within the scope of individual obligations (e.
g.
individual orders).
The User’s right to terminate the agreement with immediate effect due to Games and/or Services which are unable to be used remains unaffected.
Further claims made by the User are hereby prohibited unless otherwise expressly described in these Terms &amp; Conditions.
2 Offer and Conclusion of Contract --------------------------------------------------------------------- 2.
1 By filling in the registration form for the Account, the User enters into a binding contract (hereinafter User Application).
For this purpose, all fields of the registration form marked as being “required” must be filled in completely and correctly.
2.
2 The agreement between Bigpoint and the User is considered valid when Bigpoint approves the User Application.
Confirmation of the User Application can be explicitly communicated by Bigpoint as a result of an action on the part of Bigpoint.
2.
3 Bigpoint will promptly send a confirmation e-mail acknowledging receipt of the User application to the e-mail address provided by the User at the time of registration.
This acknowledgment of receipt does not represent a binding approval of the User Application.
The acceptance of the User application and the confirmation to access Bigpoint Games and Services can, however, be sent together with the acknowledgment e-mail.
3 Cancellation Policy --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cancellation Policy: The User can revoke his/her declaration of intent to enter into a contractual agreement for Bigpoint Games and Services and to order Premium features from Bigpoint without stating reasons, within a period of seven (7) days in written form, either by letter, fax, or e-mail.
This period shall begin upon receipt of these instructions, but not before conclusion of contract and also not before Bigpoint has fulfilled the corresponding, legal precontractual information.
The timely dispatch of the cancellation is deemed to be sufficient evidence that the cancellation deadline has been observed.
Please address the cancellation to: Bigpoint S.
à.
r.
l.
and Co, SCS Building Vertigo - Polaris 2-4 rue Eugéne Ruppert L-2453 Luxembourg E-mail:: stop.
en@bigpoint.
com If a cancellation is sent by e-mail, the name of the Game and, if applicable, the Premium features and/or Services plus the name of the User must be provided in the subject line of the e-mail.
Effects of revocation: In case of a valid withdrawal, Services or payments made by both parties must be returned and, if applicable, any associated utilization must be released.
If the User cannot return the received services to Bigpoint either in full or in part or only in deteriorated condition, the User may be liable to provide equivalent compensation.
In some cases, the User may be required to fulfill the contractual payment responsibilities for the period of time up until the revocation.
This is not applicable for the transfer of virtual goods when the deterioration of the virtual goods is caused exclusively by their examination – such as when the User might examine a good in a store before purchasing it.
The User's obligation for compensation exists when the virtual goods are used in a manner consistent with the principles of civil law which is incompatible with that of good faith or unjust enrichment.
In addition, the User can avoid an obligation to pay compensation if he/she does not treat them like his/her personal property and avoids any actions which may diminish their value.
Obligations to reimburse payments must be fulfilled within 30 days.
The period begins for the User with the dispatch of the cancellation notice; Bigpoint's period begins with the receipt of this notice.
Premature termination of the right of revocation: The revocation of the User expires prematurely if the contractual obligations are fully met by both parties at the express request of the User before the User has exercised his/her right of revocation.
This is considered to be the case when the User has made use of the Games and/or Services and/or Premium features and has paid for these in full.
End of cancellation policy 4 Availability --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bigpoint guarantees that its Games and Services will be available 90% (ninety percent) of the time on a yearly average.
Excluded from this percentage are time periods in which Bigpoint portal servers, individual Games and/or Services are not available on the Internet due to technical or other problems which are outside the control of Bigpoint, such as force majeure, third-party fault, etc.
as well as periods in which routine maintenance work is carried out.
The liability of Bigpoint with regard to inaccessibility of the games and/or services by intent and gross negligence remains unaffected.
Bigpoint can restrict access to its Games and Services if required for network security and preservation of network integrity, especially with regard to the prevention of severe breakdowns or interruptions of the network, software or stored data.

5.

Changes to the Terms &amp; Conditions will always be provided to the User with a highlighted announcement at the next login.

Furthermore, the conditions as stipulated in the second and third sentence of section 5.

1.
Until termination has been finalized, the original Terms &amp; Conditions will remain in effect.
Any payment made for Games and/or Services which extend beyond the termination date will be reimbursed to the User on a pro-rata basis.
Further claims by the User are considered hereby invalid.
5.
5 Bigpoint, in the course of informing the User about such changes, will especially inform the User about the possibility of objecting to the changes, cancellation of Services.
5.
6 Unless otherwise stipulated in these Terms &amp; Conditions or in other agreements with the User, Bigpoint will generally communicate with the User by e-mail.
The User will ensure that he/she can receive all e-mails sent by Bigpoint to the address he/she submitted to Bigpoint at the time of registration and at subsequent times.
The User is responsible for settings and maintenance of the spam filter and for regularly checking all incoming e-mail sent to this address.

Bigpoint, in the course of notifying the User about these changes, will inform the User about the possibility of objecting to the changes, cancellation of services, the set time limit and legal ramifications in the case of failing to submit an objection.
If the User objects within the set time limit, both parties reserve the right to terminate this agreement at the end of one month, unless the right to terminate immediately according to Sec 8.

Bigpoint is entitled to demand payment of the costs incurred from repeated attempts to debit the charges from the User’s account together with the original fees.

A claim to the payment of a prize can only be permitted if Bigpoint has explicitly offered/advertised such a prize.
A claim to the payment of a prize also does not exist if Bigpoint learns that a potential claim to a prize may be the result of technical or legal manipulations and/or the result of any other kind of criminal conduct, in general.
By using Bigpoint Games and Services, Users thereby agree that Bigpoint may conduct a thorough investigation at any time pertaining to the legality of the claim for prizes, and while this claim is under investigation may withhold the payment of the prize from the User without his/her express consent.
A claim to a prize will also be forfeited if the User has not complied with the rules of the Game.
If there is reason to doubt a claim, it is up to the User to provide sufficient evidence that he/she complied with the rules of the Game.
The User acknowledges and explicitly accepts this obligation to provide evidence even when it is not usually common legal practice to do so.
7.
5 No Set-off; No Right of Retention; No Cession --------------------------------------------------------------------- The User may only set off a claim by Bigpoint for outstanding accounts if his/her counterclaims cannot be disputed or have been declared legally binding.
The User can only withhold payment if their counterclaim is related to the same Terms &amp; Conditions.
The right of the User to assign his/her claims to a third party is invalid.
7.
6 Services --------------------------------------------------------------------- Unless otherwise stipulated in the Service description, Services can be used free of charge.
Furthermore, Sec.
7.

2.
1 If no limited period of time has been agreed upon for a contract, both parties may terminate the contractual agreement in a due and orderly manner with immediate effect.
8.

g.
gaming or service usage contract) for using the Games and Services and/or premiumm features has been agreed upon for a set period of time (see Sec.
7.
1.

7.

Bigpoint has the right to terminate the contractual agreement especially for, but not limited to, the following reasons: The User is late in paying fees of at least EUR 5.
00 and has not paid despite having received two reminders.
The User knowingly violates any law or the rules of the Games and Services, and does not discontinue his/her actions despite having received a warning.
A warning is not required in case of a severe offense where it would be unreasonable to expect Bigpoint to remain bound by the contract.
The User has not used their Account for a period of four weeks despite having received a reminder.
Cases in which it would be unreasonable to expect Bigpoint to remain bound by the contract generally include the following: The User violates criminal law.
The User violates the prohibition of multi-accounts which may be stipulated in the respective Game’s rules (see Sec.
1.
2 above).
The User violates the prohibition of pushing (see Sec.

2) The User deliberately provides false information upon registration 2, User application form) or while completing payment of Premium Features (see Sec.
7.
1).
In the event that Bigpoint correctly terminates the contractual agreement for important reasons, Bigpoint is entitled to charge the amount of 75% percent of all fees which the User would have had to pay for the rest of the term had the User terminated the contract of their own volition within the set time limit as governed by the contractual agreement.
The User’s right to prove that no damage occurred or that a substantially lower level of damage was caused due to the termination remains unaffected.
8.
4 Written Form for Termination --------------------------------------------------------------------- If there is no option for terminating the contract in the respective Games, the termination must be submitted in written form, whereas e-mail is considered to be in compliance with the requirement of written form.
A termination for important reasons can only be declared in written form and must include the reason(s) for the cancellation.
