This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on www.reputation.com and by Reputation.com Inc.

<p>We employ and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p> Information Security <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information, such as credit card number and social security number, on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Reputation.com, Inc.
is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security.
All personally identifiable information stored by us is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by those who need to know that information and who have special access rights to our production systems.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.
We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes.
However, no security system is perfect.
We do not guarantee or warrant that there will be no unauthorized access to your data.
We will make all reasonable business efforts to protect your information, but no system can prevent all malicious attacks against our system or commonly used Internet protocols or software (e.g., SSL).
Please see our technical pages for more information about the security systems used.</p>

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password.
You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.
You may not share your Reputation.com password with anyone.
