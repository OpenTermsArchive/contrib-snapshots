 Staples Price Match Guarantee <p>
<b>How does Staples' price–match guarantee work?</b>
</p>
<p>If you find a lower price on a new identical item, just show us the lower price when you buy the item at Staples and we will match the price, or within 14 days of your Staples purchase and we will give you the difference (see full policy below for details).</p>
<p>
<b>Which competitors will Staples price match?</b>
</p>
<p>Staples retail stores will price match prices at brick-n-mortar retail stores and at Staples.com.</p>
<p>Staples.com will price match prices at select competitors' websites and Staples' retail stores.
These select competitors are: Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Office Depot, Office Max, Quill, Medical Arts Press, Reliable, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart, WB Mason, and Xerox.
Items must be sold and shipped by one of these competitors.</p>
<p>
<b>Which items does Staples price match?</b>
</p>
<p>Almost everything we sell.
The item must be identical, including model number, components and U.S.
warranty.
The item must be in stock and available for purchase at that price from an authorized U.S.
reseller, whose authorization we reserve the right to verify.
For wireless phones and other items with a service plan, only in-store purchases are eligible for price match.
The plan, provider and other terms must be the same.
Products and services purchased online at our Mobile Phone sales &amp.
service site are not eligible for price match.</p>
<p>
<b>Which items and services aren't available for price match?</b>
</p>
<p>We don't price match to competitor or our own local or special events (e.g., grand opening, anniversary, clearance or liquidation sales).
We also don't price match: our Staples® EasyTech<sup>sm</sup> services.
We don't price match items sold on auction sites.
taxes and typographical errors.
and gift cards, gift checks, or merchandise credits.
</p>
<p>
<b>How do Staples coupons and rebates contribute to the Staples price?</b>
</p>
<p>All coupons and rebates (including Easy Rebates<sup>sm</sup>, instant rebates or savings, and Staples or manufacturer mail-in rebates) are deducted from the price of the Staples product when calculating a price match.</p>
<p>
<b>Will Staples match a competitor's price for a product where the competitor also offers an instant rebate, mail—in rebate, gift check or gift card, or free or discounted item?</b>
</p>
<p>If a competitor offers a product that comes with an instant rebate, mail—in rebate, gift check or gift card, or similar discount, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase and will not take such discounts into account.
If a competitor offers a product that comes with a free or discounted item and Staples does not carry the free or discounted item, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase and will not take the free or discounted item into account.</p>
<p>
<b>Are delivery charges included in the price match?</b>
</p>
<p>It will depend on whether your Staples.com order received free shipping, and whether the competitor offers free shipping.
If your Staples.com order received free shipping and the competitor offers free shipping, we will price match the product without considering shipping charges.
If your Staples order received free shipping and the competitor does not offer free shipping, we will include an appropriate shipping charge in the competitor's price before price matching.
If your Staples.com order did not receive free shipping and the competitor offers free shipping but the product does not qualify for such free shipping, or the competitor does not offer free shipping, we will include shipping charges on both products before price matching.</p>
<p>
<b>Are quantities limited on price–matched products?</b>
</p>
<p>We may limit the quantities of price—matched items, particularly if the competitor does.
In addition, we reserve the right to limit quantities sold to a customer.</p>
<p>Policy information is available by calling 1-800-333-3330.
For price match, see customer service desk in store or call 1-800-333-3330.

<p>
<b>Staples Easy Rebates<sup>sm</sup>
</b>
</p>
<p>Now you can submit most rebates online* — no clipping, no mailing, no hassles.
Easy Rebates are available on products purchased in Staples® stores, through our catalog and online at Staples.com®.
Look for Easy Rebate products every time you shop.
They're identified by the phrase "Easy Rebate", go to www.stapleseasyrebates.com and enter the required information right online.
You won't receive emails keeping you posted on your rebate status, with links to the track status page online.
Best of all, you'll receive your rebates faster than ever — within 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>
<b>Learn more about Easy Rebates.</b>
</p>
<p>*Certain products, including most software titles, are not eligible for online submission.
Any products excluded from the online submission process will be advertised as qualifying for a "mail–in rebate" versus an "Easy Rebate".</p>
<p>
<b>Mail in Rebates</b>
</p>
<p>Mail–in rebates are easier, too! You can find and print rebate forms, and even track the status of your mail–in rebates at www.staples.com/rebatecenter.</p>
<p>Because many rebate offers require original sales receipts and rebate forms, it is important to make copies of both and keep them with your records.
Should a problem arise with your rebate redemption, having these copies will make it easy for us to resolve the issue.
If you purchased a rebate item through our catalog or at Staples.com and a receipt is required as Proof of Purchase, you should use the packing slip that was included in your order as your receipt.
If you have any questions about your rebate, please call 1-877-266-6483 Monday through Friday 7:00am to 12:00am ET, Saturday 8:00am to 12:00am ET, and Sunday 10:00am to 12:00am ET.</p> Delivery Policy <p>
