<b>TORONTO - Southern Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Maritimes are being lashed by superstorm Sandy this morning as the massive weather system churns its way north.<br>

<br>
<br>NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A possible levee breach in northern New Jersey on Tuesday, flooded three towns with 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) of water in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, prompting the evacuation of hundreds from their homes.<br>
<br>The towns of Moonachie, Little Ferry and Carlstadt were underwater after the swollen Hackensack River broke its banks, affecting around 2,000 residents, said Jeanne Baratta, chief of the Bergen County Executive.<br>
<br>Baratta, who was on the scene with emergency personnel, said there was the possibility that the river overflowed its banks rather than broke a levee while a New Jersey State Police spokesman described it as a levee break in the borough of Moonachie.</p> Continue Reading When In Doubt, Don't <p>by Adam Rose, Posted Oct 30th 2012 7:37AM</p>

<br>
<br> NEW YORK (AP) - The effects of the superstorm that flooded parts of the city are lingering into Tuesday and likely will for much longer, with a large swath of the city out of power, subway and vehicle tunnels flooded, and the financial district closed for a second day.</p>
<p> A fire destroyed at least 50 houses overnight in Queens' flooded Rockaway peninsula and forced the rescue of about 25 people from an upstairs apartment.
Officials weren't immediately able to pin down the cause of the blaze.</p>
<p> The storm was once Hurricane Sandy but combined with two wintry systems to become a huge hybrid storm whose center smashed ashore late Monday in New Jersey.
New York City was perfectly positioned to absorb the worst of its storm surge - a record 13 feet.</p>
<p> "We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
"This is a once-in-a-long-time storm."</p> Continue Reading Sandy Shuts Down Nuclear Plants <p>by Adam Rose, Posted Oct 30th 2012 6:49AM</p>

<br>
<br> WASHINGTON - Parts of two nuclear power plant were shut down late Monday and early Tuesday, while another plant - the nation's oldest - was put on alert after waters from Superstorm Sandy rose 6 feet above sea level.</p>
<p> One of the units at Indian Point, a plant about 45 miles north of New York City, was shut down Monday because of external electrical grid issues, said Entergy Corp., which operates the plant.
The company said there was no risk to employees or the public, and the plant was not at risk due to water levels from the Hudson River, which reached 9 feet 8 inches and was subsiding.
Another unit at the plant was still operating at full power.</p> Continue Reading West Virginia Snow Up To A Foot Deep <p>by Adam Rose, Posted Oct 30th 2012 6:48AM</p>
<p> CHARLESTON, W.Va.
(AP) - A blizzard warning covers a large part of West Virginia as snow and high winds blow over Appalachia on the edges of superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p> The National Weather Service said Tuesday a foot and more of snow was reported in lower elevations of West Virginia, where most towns and roads are.
High elevations in the mountains were getting more than two feet.</p>
<p> More than 128,000 customers in West Virginia were without power.</p>
<p> Authorities closed more than 45 miles of Interstate 68 on either side of the West Virginia-Maryland state line because of blizzard conditions and stuck cars.</p>
<p> The State Highway Administration in Maryland says the higher elevations in the western state have gotten more than a foot of snow since Monday afternoon, and it was still snowing at 5 a.m.
