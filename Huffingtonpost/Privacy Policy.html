<p>When you allow us to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site profile, we may use this data for several purposes, including: <br>
</p>
<ul>

If we find a match, we will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans, followers, or friends on our Site.
</li>
<li>

This process is not automatic.
you must affirmatively choose to become a fan of these suggested users.
</li>
<li>
<i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails.</i> When users share content with their friends using, for example, the forward-to-a-friend feature on the Site, we may use friend lists from third-party services to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send the email message.
</li>
<li>
<i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send service-specific messages.</i> For example, we may use friend lists from a third-party service to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send an invitation to view an interactive slideshow.</li>
<li>
<i>To enhance and personalize your experience on the Site</i>.
When you are connected via a third-party service, we may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about certain articles or blog posts, in order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In addition, if you connect to a Facebook account, your experience on the Site may be personalized.
For example, you may automatically see what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about particular stories.
