<p>Note: You are entering into a legally binding agreement.</p> 1.
Introduction Last revised on October 23, 2014 <p>We are a social network and online platform for professionals.</p>
<p>
Our User Agreement has been updated.
click here for a summary of the changes.
</p>
1.1.
Purpose
<p>Our mission is to connect the world's professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful.
Our services are designed to promote economic opportunity for our members by enabling you and millions of other professionals to meet, exchange ideas, learn, and find opportunities or employees, work, and make decisions in a network of trusted relationships.</p> 1.2.
Agreement <p>When you use our Services (including Slideshare and Pulse), <strong>you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all of these terms.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>You also agree to our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree that by clicking “Join Now” “Join LinkedIn”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (including LinkedIn, SlideShare, Pulse, our related mobile apps, developer platforms, premium services, or any content or information provided as part of these services, collectively, “Services”), you are entering into a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a company).
If you reside in the United States, your agreement is with LinkedIn Corporation and if you reside outside of the United States, your agreement is with LinkedIn Ireland (each, “LinkedIn” or “we”).</p>
<p>
This “Agreement” includes this User Agreement and the Privacy Policy, and other terms that will be displayed to you at the time you first use certain features (such as starting a “Group,” downloading one of our software applications or purchasing advertisements or InMails™), as may be amended by LinkedIn from time to time.
If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services.
</p>
<p>Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”.
This Agreement applies to both.</p> Back to Top 2.
Obligations 2.1.
Service Eligibility <p>Here are some promises you make to us in this Agreement:</p>
<p>You're eligible to enter into this Agreement and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”</p>
<p>To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age” (defined below) or older.
(2) you will only have one LinkedIn account (and/or one SlideShare or Pulse account, if applicable), which must be in your real name.
and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services.</p>
<p>“Minimum Age” means (a) 18 years old for the People's Republic of China, (b) 16 years old for the Netherlands, (c) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia and South Korea, and (d) 13 years old for all other countries.
However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage and use of your information) then the Minimum Age is such older age.
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 13.</p> 2.2.
Your Membership <p>You'll keep your password a secret.</p>
<p>You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.</p>
<p>As between you and others, your account belongs to you.
You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password.
(2) keep your password secure and confidential.
(3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections, groups) and (4) follow the law and the Dos and Don'ts below.
You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.</p>
<p>Note that for Premium Services purchased by another party for you to use (e.g.
Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for the Premium Service controls such an account (which is different from your personal account) and may terminate your access to it.</p> 2.3 Payment <p>You'll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information.
Also, there may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.</p>
<p>We don't guarantee refunds.</p>
<p>If you purchase any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes.
Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your subscription.
Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g.
exchange rates).</li>
<li>You authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g.
credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your service (e.g.
subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new services.</li>
<li>You must pay us for applicable fees and taxes unless you cancel the Premium Service, in which case you agree to still pay these fees through the end of the applicable subscription period.
Learn how to cancel or change your Premium Services and read about LinkedIn's refund policy.</li>
<li>Taxes are calculated based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>For LinkedIn, you can get a copy of your invoice through your account settings under “Purchase History” for SlideShare you can request your invoice through Customer Support.</p> 2.4.
Notices and Service Messages <p>You're okay with us using our websites, mobile apps, and email to provide you with important notices.
This Agreement applies to mobile applications as well.
Also, you agree certain additional information can be shared with us.</p>
<p>If the contact information you provide isn't up to date, you may miss out on these notices.</p>
<p>You agree that we may provide notices to you in the following ways: (1) a banner notice on the Service, or (2) an email sent to an address you provided, or (3) through other means including mobile number, telephone, or mail.
You agree to keep your contact information up to date.</p>
<p>Please review your LinkedIn.com and Slideshare.net settings to control and limit what kind of messages you receive from us.</p> 2.5.
Messages and Sharing <p>When you share information, others can see, copy and use that information.</p>
<p>Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide deck, links to news articles, job postings, InMails and blogs.
Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members or, if public, by Visitors.
Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., sharing to a group instead of your network, changing the default setting for SlideShare content from public to a more restricted view, limiting your profile visibility, or not letting people know when you change your profile, make recommendations or follow companies).
Note that other activities, such as applying for a job or sending an InMail, are by default private, only visible to the addressee(s).</p>
<p>We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p> Back to Top 3.

<p>You agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Agreement and/or the Services.
We both agree that all of these claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and we each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p> Back to Top 7.
General Terms <p>Here are some important details about how to read the Agreement.</p>
<p>If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.
If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Agreement.
To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only.
This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
<p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Agreement.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.
However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.
There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive.
If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.</p>
