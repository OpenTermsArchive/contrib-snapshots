You may exercise your “opt out” rights, at no charge, by calling us at 1-877-ADVANCE (238-2623), or by sending us an email at webcare@advanceautoparts.com.
 
<strong>Third party links</strong>
Within our Site you may find links to websites of our partners, vendors, or advertisers.
It is important to note that Advance Auto Parts does not endorse or make any statement to the security of the websites that we provide links to.
These websites have independent security policies, privacy policies, technology and security practices that govern them.
We do not have control over their content or their security and do not accept liability of any form for the manner in which they protect and/or handle your information.
We recommend that all consumers comprehensively review the privacy policy of each website that they visit to help keep them informed on how their personal information is treated and used.
 
<strong>Cookies</strong>
We use cookies to help us remember and personalize your experience, process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements, and compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can offer better Site experiences and tools in the future.
We may contract with third-party Service Providers to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors.
These Service Providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
 
If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings.
Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.
However, you can still place orders by contacting our Call Centers or by visiting any of our Stores.
 
<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>
The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and Service Providers is not covered by our privacy statement.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and Service Providers use session ID cookies to provide a more personalized and relevant site experience, to keep track of advertisements, and to compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can offer better Site experiences in the future.
 
<strong>Log Files</strong>
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
 
We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
 
<strong>Clear GIFs (Web Beacons)</strong>
We and our partners employ a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
 
We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future promotional emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each promotional email or you may contact us via phone, email, or regular mail

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Never provide sensitive personal information (i.e.
