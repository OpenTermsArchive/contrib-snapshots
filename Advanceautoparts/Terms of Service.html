ARBITRATION
<p>
<strong>ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION AND MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT AND PROCEED IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY CLASS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON A COLLECTIVE BASIS.
ARBITRATION DOES NOT INVOLVE A JUDGE OR JURY AND THE REVIEW OF MATTERS MAY BE LIMITED BUT AN ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AS A COURT.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>BY USING THIS SITE YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING, AND THEREBY LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO OTHER AVAILABLE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES SUCH AS A COURT ACTION TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND INSTEAD YOU AGREE TO REFER YOUR DISPUTE TO AN ARBITRATION.</strong>
</p>
<p>All disputes, regardless of type, must be arbitrated, and arbitrations may only proceed individually and not as a class representative, private attorney general, or otherwise on a collective basis.</p>
<p>You understand and agree not to initiate any action or arbitration proceeding for any claim unless and until you have provided AdvanceAutoParts.com specific written notice of each claim and a reasonable opportunity after such notice to cure any such claim.</p>
<p>The forum for the arbitration shall be in a reasonably convenient county, as mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), pursuant to its then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by any other provisions that the parties may jointly agree upon in writing.
There shall be a single arbitrator, mutually selected by the parties to the dispute, and if such parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, AAA shall designate an arbitrator (the "Arbitrator").
The Arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney with at least ten (10) years of experience in business and commercial law matters.</p>
<p>If any party brings a claim in a court that is required by this Section to be brought in arbitration, and the other party successfully moves for an order or petition compelling arbitration, the non-prevailing party shall be obligated to pay the prevailing party's costs and attorney fees in connection with securing such order or petition.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall hear and determine, in advance of the hearing on the merits, any dispositive or partially dispositive motions for summary adjudication or for dismissal, and shall determine a date by which such motions must be filed.
The Arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
For the Arbitration, discovery by each party shall be limited to reasonable requests for production of documents.
No additional discovery (e.g., interrogatories, depositions or requests for admissions) shall be permitted except by mutual written consent or as ordered by the Arbitrator upon good cause shown.</p>
<p>Except as may be expressly set forth herein or as otherwise mutually agreed, each party shall bear its own costs and attorney fees occurred in connection with any dispute.
The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne as determined by the Arbitrator, and in the absence of a determination shall be shared equally by the parties.
You and AdvanceAutoParts.com retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief such as preliminary injunctions or attachments.</p>
