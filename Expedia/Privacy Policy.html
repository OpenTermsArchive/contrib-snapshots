We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way.
This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and, if you make a reservation through our site, credit card information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date).
We also may request information about your hotel room preferences, loyalty, frequent flyer and/or car rental program information.
You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, competition or promotion; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.
Travel Companion Information.
When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual.
You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.
Information from Other Sources.
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information.
Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.
Call Monitoring.
Calls to and from our customer service help desk may be recorded or monitored for the purpose of quality control and for staff training.
Call recordings will be maintained as long as reasonably necessary and will then be deleted.
Any personal information obtained from you during the call will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
How we use your information We use credit card information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site.
We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you by email or post about special offers and travel-related products and services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website; to reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.
Email Communications.
We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website.
One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests.
For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York.
Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers or other destination information.
We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites.
Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.
Please review " Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information" below to exercise your rights regarding email communications.
With whom we share your information We may share your information with the following entities:                      Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations.
Throughout this website, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party travel supplier whose products you purchase through this website.
Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit.
                     Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention.
We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests.
Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
                     Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services.
You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours.
If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners so that they can contact you directly by email or post about their products and services.
Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.
                     Referring websites.
If you were referred to this site from another website, we may share some information about you with that referring website so that they can contact you directly by email or post about their products and services.
We have not placed limitations on the referring websites’ use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you to this site.

                     In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a sale of a subsidiary or a division, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of winding-up.
We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.

This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.
We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.
We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.
