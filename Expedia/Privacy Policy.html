<br>

Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.
<br>

<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>How we use your information </b>
<br> We use credit card information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site.
We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request.

One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests.
For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York.
Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers or other destination information.
We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites.
Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.
<br>
<br> Please review " Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information" below to exercise your rights regarding email communications.<br>

<br>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from this website, you will not be able to access portions of our site.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Cookies and other Web technologies </b>
<br>
</p>
<p> We automatically collect some information about you and your computer when you visit this website.
For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari), and referring website.
We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and purchases made.
One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience.
<br>
<br>As a member or visitor to this website, you will be assigned a permanent cookie file on your computer's hard drive.
You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie.
Be advised that, by refusing to accept a cookie, you will not be able to access many travel services and planning tools offered by this site.
<br>
<br>When you access the My Trips or My Profile areas of this website, reserve or purchase travel, or use selected travel planning tools, we may require you to sign in as a member, using your Member ID and password.
Once you sign in as a member, we record the Member ID and the name on the member account in the cookie file on your computer.
We may also record your password in this cookie file as encrypted data if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Your Member ID, password, and the name on your member account is stored in the cookie file as encrypted data, so no one can view the information it contains by obtaining unauthorised access to your computer.
Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file.
<br>
<br>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as “flash cookies,” on our website.
These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website.
Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.
By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer.
Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites.
To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here.
<br>
<br>This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.
We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.
We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at our customer care email address shown below.

These third parties include (1) other Expedia Group companies.
(2) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites.

We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.
<br>
<p>
</p> Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

<p>
</p> Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.
Like other companies operating online, this site participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies or other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel).
These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests.
We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site.

<b>How we protect your information </b>
<br> We want you to feel confident about using this website to make hotel and travel bookings, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.

For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.
