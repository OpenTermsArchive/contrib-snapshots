                  LIABILITY FOR THE WEBPAGE
                </em></p>
              <p>
                Our liability in connection with these Terms, and the Webpage, is limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Unless prohibited by law, we will not be liable under any circumstances for any indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or for any loss of business, revenues, profits, goodwill, content or data, including (without limitation) due to malware or hackers, the malfunction of any software or systems, or any unauthorized use or reasons beyond our control, even if we know they are possible.

              <p><em>
                  INDEMNITY
                </em></p>
              <p>
                You agree that you indemnify us, our partners and our affiliates from and against any claim, suit, action, demand, damage, debt, loss, cost, expense (including litigation costs and attorneys’ fees) and liability arising from or relating to: (i) your use of the Webpage; or (ii) your breach of these Terms.

              <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>

                These Terms are the entire agreement between you and us for the Webpage. You will have no claim against us for anything which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part. If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable law. If we fail to enforce any provision of these Terms, it will not be construed to be a waiver of any rights. Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including but not limited to any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                No other person will have any right to enforce these Terms against any party, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms, without our prior consent. We may freely assign, transfer or sub-contract these Terms or our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or notice. You acknowledge and agree that in no event will our partners or affiliate companies have any liability under these Terms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Except to the extent that: (i) any applicable additional terms incorporated into these Terms provide differently, or (ii) the applicable law of your jurisdiction mandate otherwise (for instance, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court (including small claims court or similar court), these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
