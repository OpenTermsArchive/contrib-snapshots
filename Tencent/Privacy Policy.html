            <p class="txt"><strong>A  number of our services enable Shared Information to be shared publicly with all  users of that service and not just your contacts. Our social media services in  particular are primarily designed to help you share Shared Information with the  world, so Shared Information can be broadly and instantly transmitted and will  remain public for as long as you do not delete it (and even after you delete  Shared Information, it may still be separately cached, copied, or stored by, or  remain public through, other users or third parties who are not affiliated with  and not controlled by us). </strong></p>

            <p class="txt">We  may from time to time send you service-related announcements when we consider  it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend one of our services  for maintenance). You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements,  which are not promotional in nature.  <strong></strong></p>
            <p class="txt"><strong>A  WORD ABOUT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p class="txt">In  some jurisdictions, certain Personal Information, such as information about  your race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical views or personal  health, is characterised as “sensitive” and is subject to stricter regulation  than other personal information.  Please  note that content and information that you input to our services, such as  photographs or information about your school or social activities, may reveal  your sensitive Personal Information to others. </p>
            <p class="txt">We  urge you to consider whether it is appropriate to communicate sensitive Personal  within our services.</p>

              <li>we may (whether in advertisements or otherwise within our services)  provide you with links that allow you to access third party services or  websites.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt">These  third party social media or other services may be hosted by the relevant third  party or us. Your use of any such third party services (whether social media  services or otherwise), including any Personal Information you provide to such  third parties, are subject to the relevant third party’s own terms of services  and privacy policies and not the <a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/service-agreement.html"><em>Terms of Service</em></a> &nbsp;or this Privacy Policy, so please review their terms carefully. </p>

            <p class="txt">We  operate and may continue to operate servers in a number of jurisdictions around  the world, so the server on which your Personal Information is used and stored  may not be in your jurisdiction.</p>
            <p class="txt"><strong>You  consent to the transfer of your Personal Information (both inside and outside  of your jurisdiction) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> </p>
            <p class="txt">We  use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose of  preventing loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure of Information.</p>
            <p class="txt">In  some of our services, we will use encryption technology (such as SSL) to  protect certain sensitive Information provided by you to us.<strong> </strong>Please be  aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100%  security at all times. Our systems and the communications networks through  which you access our services may be subject to security breaches and failures  which are due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p>
            <p class="txt"><strong>RETENTION  OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p class="txt">Subject  to applicable laws and regulations (including as set out under the “Sharing of  your Personal Information” section above), we will only retain your Personal  Information for so long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes as set out  under the “How We Use Your Information” section above.  </p>
            <p class="txt">Subject  to applicable laws and regulations, you may have the right to request to  receive a copy of and make any corrections to your Personal Information which  we hold, or to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that is  stored by us. You may direct such request to our Privacy Officer. We will  respond to all requests made to our Privacy Officer under this “Retention of  your Personal Information” section within 60 days. </p>
            <p class="txt">In  addition, within some of our services, we may offer you options to amend or  delete, and/or change how we and the public can view and/or access, your  Personal Information and/or Shared Information within those services – in which  case, please log into your account with us within the relevant service and make  the appropriate changes.</p>
            <p class="txt">Should  your account be terminated by you or us for any reason, we will (subject to the  above paragraph) take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is no  longer available through our services, or otherwise used by us, within a  reasonable period of time (subject to technical limitations) after such account  termination. However, it is important to note that communications made by you  using our services may put your Personal Information in the hands of third  parties that we cannot control – for example, if you have previously made your  Personal Information public via our services. In some instances, we may not be able to delete your Personal  Information and/or Shared Information from our services or systems – in which case  we will (where reasonably practicable) let you know why we are unable to do so. </p>
