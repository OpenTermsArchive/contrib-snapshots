<li> Perform research only within the scope set out below;</li>
<li> Review our Severity: None disclosures<i>
</i> to avoid filing unwanted reports;</li>
<li> Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us;</li>
<li> Report vulnerabilities as soon as you discover them.
and</li>
<li> Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Gratipay until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue.</li>

<p>If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;</li>
<li> Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission).</li>

<p>We target an "A" grade on SSLLabs for both grtp.co<i>

<ul>
<li>Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g.
open doors, tailgating).</li>
<li>Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g.
phishing, vishing).</li>
<li>Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section.</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports with video only PoCs.</li>
<li>Reports that state that software is out of date/vulnerable without a proof of concept.</li>
<li>Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage.
Be concrete.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they're an issue.</li>
<li>Reports from automated web vulnerability scanners (Acunetix, Vega, etc.) that have not been validated.</li>
<li>Recently disclosed 0day vulnerabilities.
We need time to patch our systems just like everyone else - please give us 30 days before reporting these types of issues.</li>
<li>Issues in third-party services should be reported to the respective team.
Please take a look at the "Third-party Services" section for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>⚠️ The following issue types are excluded from scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Low severity issues that can be detected with tools such as Hardenize<i>
</i> and SecurityHeaders.io<i>
</i>.</li>
<li>XSS issues that affect only outdated browsers<i>
</i>.</li>
<li>Content injection issues.</li>
<li>Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) with minimal security implications (Logout CSRF, etc.).</li>

<li>Host header issues without an accompanying proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability.</li>
<li>Open ports without an accompanying proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability.</li>
<li>Banner grabbing issues (figuring out what web server we use, etc.).</li>

<p>⚠️ Things we do not want to receive:</p>
<ul>
<li> Personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
<li> Credit card holder data</li>
<li> Duplicates of reports we've already identified as Severity: None<i>
</i>
</li>
</ul>Reporting <p>If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms, please send it to us on HackerOne.</p>
<p>Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps.
If a report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, it will not be eligible for a bounty.
We also ask you to cite references and not to copy/paste entire reports.
Reports copied entirely or mostly from elsewhere will not be eligible for a bounty.</p>
<p>We especially appreciate reports containing the affected code from our GitHub repository<i>
</i>, and possibly even patches, and we encourage you to test our platform by setting up Gratipay locally<i>
</i>.
That way you can test all sorts of payloads to your heart's content.</p> Awards <p>If you are the first to report an issue, and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue, we will award you:</p> Severity
