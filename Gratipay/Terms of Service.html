</li>
<li>
<p>General Terms</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service is a platform to facilitate payments for goods or services.
The nature and scope of such goods or services (the “Work”) is defined
by Projects established on the Service.</li>
<li>A Participant who establishes a Project is also a Project Owner.</li>
<li>Projects may optionally have other Participants as Collaborators.
The
Project Owner is also a Collaborator.</li>
<li>A Participant may make payments to a Project Owner via a Project.
A
Participant who makes payments via a Project is a Giver.</li>
<li>Payments made through the form on the homepage are payments to Gratipay
for open source software.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terms for Project Owners</p>
<ol>
<li>A Project Owner can use the Service to receive payments from Givers for
Work provided by the Project's Collaborators.
When you establish a
Project on the Service, you agree that payments via the Project will be used
exclusively to support the Work described in the Project's profile.</li>
<li>Project Owners may only make payments to Collaborators for their
collaboration in the Project's Work.</li>
<li>Gratipay is not a party to any agreement between Project Owners and
Givers, and is not responsible to either the Project Owner or the Giver
if either party breaches the terms of any such agreement (e.g.
if the Project
Owner fails to provide the promised goods or services).</li>
<li>Establishing a Project on Gratipay involves an application and approval
process.
As part of this process, the Gratipay community will have the
opportunity to publicly evaluate and provide commentary about the Project.
However, all decisions regarding whether to accept, reject, suspend, remove, or
take any other action regarding a Project belong solely to Gratipay.</li>
<li>Gratipay reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove a Project at
any time, and for any reason.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terms for Collaborators</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Owners can use the Service to distribute payments to
Collaborators.</li>
<li>Collaborators may only receive payments from Project Owners for their
collaboration in the Project's Work.</li>
<li>Gratipay is not a party to any agreement between Project Owners and
Collaborators, and is not responsible to either the Project Owner or the
Collaborator if either party breaches the terms of any such agreement (e.g.
if
the Collaborator fails to provide the promised goods or services).</li>
<li>Gratipay does not determine how payments are allocated and is not
responsible for how Project Owners distribute payments.
Any agreement
between the Project's Owner and other Collaborators regarding the allocation of
payments is solely between those parties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terms for Givers</p>
<ol>
<li>Givers may only make payments to Project Owners for the Project's Work.</li>
<li>You understand and acknowledge that your payment does not entitle you
personally to receive any goods or services from the Project Owner,
unless the Project Owner explicitly offers those things to Givers.</li>
<li>Project Owners are the only party responsible to Givers for producing
the Work their Project describes.
Gratipay does not warrant or guarantee
that Project Owners will provide the Work they promise, and Gratipay is not
obligated to provide refunds to Givers or produce work under any circumstance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees and Taxes</p>
<ol>
<li>Gratipay does not take any fee from payments made by Givers to Project
Owners, or by Project Owners to Collaborators.
Gratipay and the Service
are funded through the Service itself, by voluntary payments from Givers who
wish to fund our own Work.

Project page for the Service.</li>
<li>You are responsible for paying any third-party fees associated with your
use of the Service, such as credit card and bank fees.</li>
<li>You are responsible for paying any taxes and withholdings associated
with your use of the Service.
In particular, Project Owners, and not
Gratipay, are responsible for compliance with all laws, as well as any taxes
and withholding requirements, applicable to payments made to Collaborators
(whether through the Service or otherwise), including without limitation
payroll tax, unemployment insurance, and worker compensation insurance
payments.
Project Owners are also responsible for providing any required tax
and other documentation to employees, independent contractors, tax authorities,
