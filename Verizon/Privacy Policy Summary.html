 Privacy Policy Español Privacy Policy Summary <p>At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers.
Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.</p>
<p>Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors, app users, applicants and customers in the United States.  It applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services we provide, except it does not apply to our Oath, Mapquest or Visible affiliates which have separate privacy policies. In addition, some Verizon services and apps, such as MapQuest, hum, Message+ and AppFlash have additional privacy practices that are presented separately. If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the service-specific policies, the service-specific policy governs when you are using that service.</p>
<p>A separate policy governs the collection of personal data by the Verizon family of companies outside the United States.</p>
<p>Below, we've summarized key elements from our full privacy policy for your convenience.</p>

Information provided to or used by third-party advertisers
<p>Verizon and third-party advertisers seek to provide advertising that is more relevant to your interests on  the websites, apps, services and devices you use.

Oath will honor the choices Verizon customers have made about the uses of their information when they receive and use this data.</p>
<p>Except as explained in our Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with others outside of Verizon who are not doing work on Verizon‘s behalf without your consent.
We may share information with our vendors and partners for business purposes and when necessary for them to perform work on our behalf.
