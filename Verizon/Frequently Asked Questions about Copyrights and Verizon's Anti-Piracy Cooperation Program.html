Account Copyright and Anti-Piracy Cooperation Program FAQs Frequently Asked Questions about Copyrights and Verizon's Anti-Piracy Cooperation Program <ul>
<li> What is copyright infringement? </li>
<li>
<p> Using copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner or its authorized representative is in many instances unlawful and can subject those who do so to potential civil and criminal liability.
This is called copyright infringement and it not only violates U.S.
copyright law, it also violates Verizon’s Acceptable Use Policy and Terms of Service.
Additional information about copyrights and content piracy is available at the U.S.
Copyright Office’s website at copyright.gov.</p>
</li>
<li> What is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)? </li>
<li>
<p> The DMCA was passed in 1998 by the U.S.
Congress to protect copyrighted works in the digital age while providing important protections for online service providers to ensure the free flow of information.
Additional information about the DMCA is available at the U.
S.
Copyright office's website at http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf.
Information about how to submit a takedown notice to Verizon’s DMCA designated agent and Verizon’s DMCA Repeat Infringer Policy is available at http://www.verizon.com/about/terms-conditions/terms-of-use.</p>
</li>
<li> What is the Verizon Anti-Piracy Cooperation Program? </li>
<li>
<p> The Verizon Anti-Piracy Cooperation Program involves sending notices by email to our subscribers relating to claims of alleged copyright infringement from copyright owners.
The program is designed to alert you to potential infringing activity involving your account.</p>
</li>
<li> How do copyright owners identify accounts that may be involved with copyright infringement? </li>
<li>
<p> When a copyright owner identifies an instance of possible infringement, it sends the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP) a notice that contains the name of the copyrighted work, the date and time of the alleged infringement and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that is alleged to be sharing copyrighted material.
The ISP matches the IP address sent by the copyright owner to the specific customer to whom that IP address was assigned at that time, and then sends the information provided by the copyright owner to that user without identifying the user to the copyright owner.</p>
<p> If you would like to speak with a specialist to explain this information, you can call the Copyright Notification Department at 866.286.6865 between 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM ET Monday through Friday.</p>
</li>
<li> How does Verizon protect my privacy? </li>
<li>
<p> The copyright owner <u>
<strong>does not</strong>
</u> know the actual identity of the user assigned to the IP address associated with activity that they believe may constitute copyright infringement.
While we, as your ISP, know the customer assigned to a particular IP address, we <strong>
<u>do not</u>
</strong> share that information with the copyright owner.
We will only provide your identity under the program if we receive a legal demand (such as a subpoena or court order) to do so.</p>
</li>
<li> What do I do if I'm sure that I have not infringed any copyrights? </li>
<li>
<p> If you receive a notice, we recommend that you confirm that the copyrighted material referred to in the notice is on any computer or other device with access to your Internet service and check to see if your computer or other device has any P2P or file sharing software on it.
You should also discuss the notice with others who have access to your Internet service.
If you have a wireless router, please refer to the "If I am using a wireless router/modem, how do I protect my home network?" question and answer below for more information on ways to secure your home network.</p>
<p> If you would like to speak with a specialist to explain this information, you can call the Copyright Notification Department at 866.286.6865 between 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM ET Monday through Friday.</p>
</li>
<li> I've lost the notice you sent me - can I view it anywhere else online? </li>
<li>
<p> You may view your notice online by logging onto My Verizon with your Verizon User ID and password and clicking the link that appears in the pop up message to access your Alleged Copyright Violation Notifications history.</p>
<p> If you would like to speak with a specialist to explain this information, you can call the Copyright Notification Department at 866.286.6865 between 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM ET Monday through Friday.</p>
</li>
<li> Is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing risky? </li>
<li>
<p> Yes, it can be.
Aside from the legal liability for unlawful infringement described above, the use of P2P software can expose your computer and other devices to harmful viruses, spyware and other malware that can compromise your privacy.
This can happen by using P2P and file-sharing software and downloading files you may think are music or video files but are really malware that can secretly steal your passwords, personal information, or bank account or credit card numbers.</p>

<li> If I am using a wireless router or modem, how do I protect my home network? </li>
<li>
<p> Verizon recommends using the strongest network encryption compatible with your network devices to prevent others from accessing your connection without your permission.
In most cases, that is WPA2 encryption.
However, you will notice some older routers or modems may not be compatible with WPA2 encryption.
In those instances, WPA is the preferred encryption because it is still stronger than WEP.
For step-by-step instructions for upgrading your network security, please visit router setup page and select the router you are using and the type of encryption you prefer.</p>
<p> Finally, one of the most effective ways to protect your computers and data from unwanted intrusions is to use updated firewall software.
You should also install and use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and keep your software up to date.
There are many different types of security software available, including the Verizon Internet Security Suite.
For more information about how firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware software works and to sign-up for the Verizon Internet Security Suite software, which includes a built-in-firewall, please visit us at Verizon Internet Security Suite.</p>
