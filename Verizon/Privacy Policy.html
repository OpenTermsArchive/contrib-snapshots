 Privacy Policy Gizmo Privacy Policy <p>Verizon’s Gizmo products and services include tablets, wearables, as well as the GizmoHub app which allows parents to locate and monitor usage of Gizmo devices.  Gizmo’s privacy practices are covered by the Verizon Privacy Policy as well as the Gizmo-specific practices described here.
In the event of a conflict between the two policies, the practices described in this policy govern when you are using Gizmo products and services.</p>
Information we collect and how it is used
<p>We collect information when you set up Gizmo services through the GizmoHub app, including your name, mobile number, email address, and child’s name, age and gender.
Depending on the Gizmo device your child uses, we may collect device identifiers and geolocation information.
Gizmo wearables may also collect the number of steps taken, call and text usage, and messages exchanged between the wearable and GizmoHub app.
Gizmo tablets collect information about usage of the GizmoTab Kids World, such as the names of apps used and amount of use.</p>
<p>Information we collect is used to deliver, maintain, support and improve Gizmo services, including to provide you with precise geolocation information for your Gizmo devices, and for analytics.</p>
<p>We do not collect more information from Gizmo devices than is reasonably necessary to deliver Gizmo services.
 Gizmo products and services do not allow children to make their personal information publicly available.</p>
Information we share
<p>We share personal information with vendors and partners who do work on our behalf.
These vendors and partners may use personal information shared with them only for purposes related to providing Gizmo services to you.</p>
Your choices
<p>Parents are asked to provide certain consents when they set up Gizmo services through the Gizmo Hub app.
Specifically, parents are asked to provide consent for all Gizmo devices that are paired with the app to collect device identifiers and geolocation and for Gizmo wearables to collect steps taken and call and text usage.
Parents may revoke such consent at any time.
However, certain Gizmo services will not be available without this consent.
Parents may review the information collected from Gizmo devices, such as the device identifiers, geolocation, steps and call and text usage information, and Kids World app usage.
For more information or assistance with these choices, including to review the information collected, please contact Gizmo at gizmopalsupport@verizonwireless.com.</p>
