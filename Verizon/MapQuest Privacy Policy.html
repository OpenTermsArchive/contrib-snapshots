 Depending on how you use MapQuest services, information we collect may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information you give to us: We collect registration-related information (such as your name, picture, email, home, work, and favorite addresses) you may provide when you register for or log into MapQuest, use MapQuest services, participate in rewards programs, or enter prize or contest promotions.</li>
<li>Information we collect about your use of MapQuest services: We collect information about your browser and device (such as your IP address, mobile telephone number, mobile device identifiers, device type, and browser or operating system), and your use of the MapQuest services (such as searches you conduct, directions we provide, and route data).
To provide some of its services and as described below, MapQuest requires information about the precise location of your device.
When location collection is enabled, we collect or infer your precise location using cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensor (gyroscope, accelerometer, light, magnetometer and pressure) and GPS location information we obtain from your device.
Consistent with your permissions, information, including location, is collected from your device even when you are not using the app. </li>
<li>Information we receive from other sources: We may receive data from other Verizon affiliates (including Oath) as well as third parties (including business partners, third party technology vendors, and social media websites that you use).</li>
<li>Cookies and related technologies:  MapQuest uses cookies and related technologies as described in the Verizon Cookie Policy.  Third party advertising networks that we work with may also place and access cookies on your browser to collect information about your visit on the MapQuest website.
Information they collect from our website is in a form that does not identify you personally and may be combined with similar data they obtain from other websites to help advertisers better reach audiences they wish to target.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the data we collect or receive about users' online and in-app activities to help us show ads for products or services users are likely to be interested in.
We retain certain information for a limited time to aid in the targeting of ads, as well as for fraud detection and prevention.
Data used to create segments for ad targeting is retained for no longer than 2 years.</p>
<p>You can control the use of cookies or device advertising identifiers at any time using your browser and mobile device settings.  Please note that browser cookies and ad identifiers are specific to the browser and device you are using.
If you buy a new computer or wireless device, change web browsers or devices or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt out again.
Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our app and website.</p>

Oath will use MapQuest customer data consistent with the choices you make about how your information can be used.</p>
<p>We also share your information with vendors and business partners for business purposes, for example when we need them to perform work on our behalf to provide you with the MapQuest services.  We require that these vendors and partners protect your information through contractual provisions or other similar means.</p>
<p>We may share de-identified location information with third parties for limited aggregate purposes, including, for example, traffic reporting.</p>

<p>The Oath privacy policy describes choices you have about the use of your information for Oath advertising purposes such as opting out of online interest based advertising and using mobile device controls.</p>
<p>In accordance with industry self-regulatory principles, we require that companies disclose when they deliver interest-based ads on MapQuest or collect information through MapQuest for these purposes.
You may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Choices to learn more or to limit the collection of information by parties who participate in the industry’s opt-out page.</p>
<p>If you participate in a MapQuest rewards program, you may opt-out at any time by visiting the settings available in the MapQuest product offering that service.</p>
Security
<p>MapQuest has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store.</p>
<p>Personal information and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we process them (as described elsewhere in this policy) or otherwise for strictly necessary business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.</p>
<p>Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.
We maintain security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.</p>
