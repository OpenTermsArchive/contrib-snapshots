The driver safety score is based solely on location and motion activity information from your mobile device and does not include information from the Hum device.</p>
<p>We also use mobile device location information for navigation, roadside assistance, to provide you with local discounts, and for the app’s group location feature.
The group location feature within the Hum App allows you to create or join groups of Hum app users who share their mobile device location with each other in real time and also offers the ability to receive notifications when group members come and go from specified locations.</p>

Hum information may also be shared with third parties in a way that does not identify you personally.
For example, recipients may use this information to provide traffic reporting or similar services or car manufacturers could use it to understand characteristics about vehicle models.</p>
