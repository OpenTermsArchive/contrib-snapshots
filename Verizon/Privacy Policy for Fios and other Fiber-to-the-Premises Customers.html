<p>We also obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, website “refer-a-friend” options or social media platforms and may combine it with information we have to contact you or direct Verizon marketing offers to you.</p>
Information you provide
<p>When you contact us for information or when you enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may use the information you supply to provide you with information about Verizon services, programs or offerings.
Certain promotions may require that we disclose information, such as contest winners or provide information for prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules.
Information you provide on our websites about your preferred location and other preferences may be used to provide you with more relevant product recommendations, services and special offers.</p>
<p>If you provide information to us in the context of an event or promotion that Verizon sponsors with another organization, or if you visit a co-sponsored site or use a co-sponsored service, you also may be providing information to the co-sponsor.
You should refer to that co-sponsor's privacy policy for information about its practices which may differ from Verizon’s practices.</p>
<p>We also collect information from you when you participate in surveys or provide other feedback to us regarding our products or services, when you register to receive news or public policy updates, or when you apply for a job with or a grant from Verizon.
We use this information for the purposes for which you provide it.</p>
<p>We may send you emails that communicate information about your account or about products, services, and promotions that may be of interest to you.
We may collect information when you open these emails or click on links within the emails.
The information is used to personalize the content of the emails themselves and make future communications and marketing more interesting to you.
Please note that we will not ask you to send sensitive personal or account information via email.</p>
Information about the Cable Act
<p>To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Cable Act"), applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects.
This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it.
In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights.
(Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).</p>
<p>The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services.
Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber’s prior consent.
Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber’s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.</p>
<p>We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order.
We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.</p>
<p>If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please contact us at privacyoffice@verizon.com and we will work with you to address your concerns.
If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs.
Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>The Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber’s viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided.
If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.</p>
Relevant advertising programs
<p>Verizon’s Relevant TV Advertising program helps make Fios TV ads you see more interesting and useful.
The program uses information we have about your postal address and use of Verizon products and services (such as services packages, connected devices, TV and video purchases and viewing data), as well as demographics and interest information you provide or we obtain from other companies (such as gender, family size, and luxury car owner).
The program may also use information Oath or advertisers and advertising partners provide to us.
We use the information to predict whether you fit within an audience an advertiser is trying to reach and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
Ads may be shown on the platforms where you watch Fios TV content.
We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of this program other than with vendors and partners who do work for us.
We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us.  You have a choice about receiving this type of advertising and you can opt out by going to the <b>Services</b> area of <b>My Verizon</b>, clicking on <b>TV</b>, then selecting the <b>Manage TV Advertising Preferences</b> link within <b>My TV Service</b>.</p>

Information we share
Information shared within the Verizon family of companies:
<p>Verizon shares customer information within our family of companies for a variety of purposes, including, for example, providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions.
You can limit the sharing of certain types of customer information, specifically, Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and certain credit information, within the Verizon family of companies for marketing services to you other than your current services.</p>
<p>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, and location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.
Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.
Credit information includes your credit score, information found in your consumer reports, and your account history.</p>
<p>We may also share information with Oath as described in this privacy policy or in a separate service-specific policy.  Oath will honor the choices Verizon customers have made about the use of their information when they receive and use this data.</p>
Information shared outside the Verizon family of companies:
<p>Except as explained in our full Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, we do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies for non-Verizon purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.</p>
<p>We use vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we provide.
We share information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf.
For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.
We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided.
We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies, for example, to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or preparing and sharing aggregate reports.
This information does not identify Verizon customers individually.</p>
<p>Verizon may publish the names, addresses and telephone numbers of wireline telephone customers ourselves or we may provide this information to directory publishers, directory assistance services, or others.
These companies can use the data they receive from us in other formats or for other purposes and they may make it available to others.
We also provide the names of telephone numbers of wireline customers for Caller ID and similar services.</p>
<p>We may disclose information that individually identifies our customers or identifies customer devices in certain circumstances, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;</li>
<li>in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies;</li>
<li>to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;</li>
<li>to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our products and services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use;</li>
<li>to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings and elsewhere;</li>
<li>to credit bureaus or collection agencies to determine credit risk, for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for Verizon-billed products and services;</li>
<li>to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information;</li>
<li>to outside auditors and regulators.
or</li>
<li>with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you purchase services offered jointly by Verizon and a partner company or when you use features in our apps or on our sites that are provided by partners, information may be collected and used by both Verizon and the partner.
You should review the partner company's privacy policy as it may be different from the policy described here.</p>
<p>If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets or business, customer information will also be transferred as part of or in connection with the transaction.</p>
Information provided to or used by third-party advertising entities or social networks:
<p>If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our apps, sites or services, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies.
We may permit advertisers on our sites, apps and services to place ads based on certain information we have about your Verizon products and services as well as geographic or demographic data.
Information used for this purpose does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>Verizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with Verizon pages you visit or services you use, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.</p>
How to limit the sharing and use of your information
<p>You have choices about how we share and use information.</p>
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
<p>Customers of Verizon telecommunications and VoIP services may choose to limit the sharing of CPNI for Verizon’s marketing of services outside of services you currently have.
Notice about our use and sharing of CPNI and the choices you have may be provided on your monthly bill, over the phone, via text, in contracts or in other ways.
Consumers and certain business customers may opt out by calling 1.866.483.9700.</p>
Information about Your Credit
<p>You can limit the sharing of credit information for our marketing of new services to you.  You may opt-out of this sharing by following the instructions in the notice provided on your monthly bill, or by calling 1-844-366-2879. </p>
Telemarketing
<p>Federal "Do Not Call" laws allow you to place your phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry to prohibit many telemarketing calls to those numbers.
If you would like to add your numbers to this list, you may do so by calling 1.888.382.1222, or by visiting donotcall.gov.</p>
<p>Most telemarketing laws allow companies to contact their own customers without consulting the federal or state Do Not Call lists.
If you would like to be removed from Verizon’s residential telemarketing list, please contact us at 1.800.VERIZON (1.800.837.4966).
Please allow 30 days for your telephone number to be removed from any sales programs that are currently underway.</p>
Marketing email, text messages, postal mail and door-to-door calls
<p>Marketing emails you receive from Verizon include an unsubscribe instruction (usually found at the bottom of the email) that you may use to opt out of receiving future marketing-related emails.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailings or prevent door-to-door marketing solicitations from us by calling 1.800.VERIZON (1.800.837.4966).
Text message solicitations from Verizon also contain an "unsubscribe" feature that you can use to prevent future marketing text messages from us.
Please note that we may use bulk mail service for some marketing mailings.
These services deliver offers to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code.
This type of mailing will continue even if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related postal mailings from us.</p>
Advertising programs
<ul>
<li>When you opt out, you will need your account user ID and password.  Also, please note that you will receive ads whether you participate in these programs or not, but ads delivered by these programs may be more interesting and useful to you. </li>
<li>Fios Internet access customers may opt-out of the Relevant Online Advertising program by going to the <b>Services</b> area of <b>My Verizon</b>, clicking on <b>Internet</b>, then selecting the <b>Manage Online Advertising Preferences</b> link within <b>My Internet Service</b>.</li>
<li>Fios TV customers may opt out of the Relevant TV Advertising program by going to the <b>Services</b> area of <b>My Verizon</b>, clicking on <b>TV</b>, then selecting the <b>Manage TV Advertising Preferences</b> link within <b>My TV Service</b>.</li>
</ul>Location information
<p>Mobile device operating systems have a location setting.  When you turn this setting to “off,” the device stops collecting your location and stops transmitting location information to apps on the device, including Verizon apps that use location information.
Other device settings allow you to stop the transmission of location data to individual apps on your device.</p>
<p>We may use certain location information we collect, such as information about the location of Wi-Fi access points, to help improve location accuracy in our services or apps.
If you do not want us to use your Wi-Fi router information, you should change your router’s name so that it contains “_nomap” or “_optout.” For example, if your router is named “Myrouter”, you could rename it “Myrouter_nomap.”</p>
Working together to help keep children safe
<p>Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online.
We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose individually identifying information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by sending an email to abuse@verizon.net.
Please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email.
You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through its CyberTipline located at cybertipline.org.</p>
Information security and data retention
<p>Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including social security numbers.
Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.
Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access.
Personally identifiable information and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.</p>
<p>Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.
We maintain security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.</p>
<p>If you become aware of a security issue, please contact our Security Control Center at: HQD03A78, P.O.
Box 152092, Irving, TX, 75015-2092.
Fax: 1.800.997.9981.
We will work with you to address any problems.</p>
Accessing and updating your information
<p>We want to keep our customer records as accurate as possible.
You may correct or update your Verizon customer information by calling customer service at 1.800.VERIZON (1.800.837.4966) or by accessing your account online at verizon.com/myverizon. Fios and other customers served over our fiber-to-the-premises network who would like to see their personally identifiable information, may contact us at privacyoffice@verizon.com to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours.
You will need to provide proper identification and you may examine records that contain personally identifiable information about you and no one else.
If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to ensure that corrections are made.
Verizon reserves the right to charge you for the cost of photocopying any documents you request.</p>
Changes to this policy
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy, so please check back periodically for changes.
You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking to see the effective date posted at the end of the policy.</p>
<p>If we elect to use or disclose information that identifies you as an individual in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt-out mechanism.</p>
