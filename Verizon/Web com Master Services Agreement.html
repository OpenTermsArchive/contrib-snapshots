INTRODUCTION </strong>
</p>
<p>THIS SERVICES AGREEMENT (the “Agreement” and/or “Terms and Conditions”), as amended from time to time by Web.com Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns (the terms “Web.com,” “us,” “we” and/or “our” shall refer to Web.com), between you (the terms “Customer,” “you” and/or “your” shall refer to the individual, entity or organization that accepts this Agreement, has access to your account or uses the Services) and Web.com, sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your purchase and/or use of our products and services (collectively, the "Services") as further set forth herein.
You and Web.com together may be referred to herein as the “Parties” and each may be referred to herein as a “Party.” This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us in relation to any Services you purchase or otherwise utilize. </p>
<p>You acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by all of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, as well as all other applicable rules or policies, terms and conditions, or service agreements that are or may be established by Web.com from time to time and are incorporated herein by reference.
You may also elect to purchase additional Services (the “Additional Services”) from Web.com, our partners and/or other third parties, which may have their own service agreements or other related terms and conditions, and it is your obligation to review, accept and abide by those service agreements or other related terms and conditions, as well as this Agreement. </p>
<p>Web.com agrees to comply in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) to the extent applicable to Web.com and to the extent Web.com is storing, processing, or transmitting any “Cardholder Data” or “Sensitive Authentication Data” (as those defined under the PCI-DSS) in connection with the Services.  </p>
<p>

SERVICES </strong>
</p>
<p>This Agreement applies to all Services, whether purchased or utilized separately or as part of a complete solution or packaged bundle.
Your purchase of the Services, continued use of the Services, and/or continued access to the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement.
If you purchase Services that are sold together as a “bundled” package (e.g., you purchase a package that includes both a domain name and a website builder or other Services, as opposed to your purchasing such Services separately), termination of any part of the Services will result in the termination of all Web.com Services provided as part of the bundled package.
See Section 4 (Termination) for additional details on this subject.
Web.com further reserves the right to modify the Services, at our sole and absolute discretion, either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, with or without notice to you.
You agree that Web.com shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification of the Services and that your continued use of the modified Services, and/or continued access to the modified Services, constitutes your acceptance of any such modifications. </p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that some or all of the Services you purchase or receive from us may be provided by one or more vendors, contractors or affiliates selected by Web.com in its sole and absolute discretion.
As a part of your Services, Web.com may provide you access to third-party functionality or services, including, but not limited to, applications, widgets, Rich Site Summary (“RSS”), other types of news, event and industry feeds, calculators, recommended copy, forms and templates that are incorporated or offered as a part of one or more of the Services (collectively, “Third-Party Functionality”).
You acknowledge and agree that your use of any Third-Party Functionality to which you are provided access as part of any Web.com Services is in accordance with the terms of any relevant third-party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions.
Your failure to abide by any such third- party licenses, agreements and/or terms and conditions may result in the immediate termination of your Services provided by Web.com.
You understand and agree that Web.com does not control such Third-Party Functionality and is therefore not liable to you or any third party for any issues of any kind relating to issues relating to Third- Party Functionality.
Web.com reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate, suspend, cancel or alter your access to Third-Party Functionality at any time and without notice to you. </p>
<p>
<strong>3.
FEES AND PAYMENTS, TERM &amp.
RENEWALS </strong>
</p>
<p>As consideration for the Services you purchase, order or otherwise utilize, you agree to pay Web.com all applicable prices and fees as designated in the related order process, with such prices and fees subject to change as provided in this Agreement.
All prices and fees are due immediately or upon ordering and are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, as required by applicable law, or as such prices and fees are billed by Web.com under an invoice or order confirmation for Services issued to a Customer that expressly permits payment within thirty (30) days after Web.com has sent the Customer such invoice or order confirmation ("Net-30 Customers").
Web.com may require a Customer to successfully complete a credit application prior to such Customer qualifying to become a Net-30 Customer. </p>
<p>If you require Additional Services, then additional prices and fees will apply pursuant to then current rates, which are also subject to change in accordance with this Agreement.
All quoted prices and fees exclude all applicable sales tax, use tax, value added tax (“VAT”), and other taxes and government charges, whether federal, state or foreign.
You are responsible for payment of all such taxes (other than based on Web.com’s income), fees, duties and charges on your payment for the purchase of Services arising from any and all fees under this Agreement.
Accordingly, you agree to pay all VAT, sales and other taxes (other than taxes based on Web.com income) related to Web.com services or payments made by you hereunder.
All payments of prices and fees for Web.com Services shall be made in U.S.
dollars.  Although Web.com may display pricing in various currencies, transaction processing is supported only in U.S.
dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase.
If the currency of your bank or credit card account is not in U.S.
dollars, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank or credit card company.
In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process.
(ii) the time the transaction is processed.
and </p>
<p>(iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank or credit card, the conversion rates may fluctuate and Web.com makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank or credit card for payment will be the same amount that is posted to your bank or credit card statement or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank or credit card statement, and you agree to waive any and all claims against Web.com based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing).
You acknowledge and agree that you may be charged VAT based on the country indicated in the account holder’s address information associated with your account.
Set up prices and fees, if any, will become payable on the applicable effective date for the applicable Services. </p>
<p>Unless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, payment for the Services are to be made via a charge to your credit card, charge card, PayPal account or bank account provided to us (“the Account”).
You are solely and absolutely responsible for any Account  information that you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes or updates to the method of payment.
By submitting an order for Services, you authorize Web.com to charge the order to the Account or to otherwise immediately bill you for the Services.
You acknowledge and agree that unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the order process or otherwise changed afterwards in accordance with the applicable process, all annual, monthly or other recurring fees related to the Services or otherwise referenced in this Agreement are to be recurring transactions that will be billed on an ongoing basis until the Services are terminated in accordance with this Agreement.
If you have provided billing information sufficient for automatic billing, then Web.com will bill you automatically in accordance with the applicable billing frequency.
You are obligated to pay for the full amount of the Agreement, even if such full amount is scheduled to be paid in installments.
If you elect to pay for the Services in installments, provided such a payment schedule is expressly permitted and accepted by Web.com, all installments must be received on or before the applicable due date.
If you qualify, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, extend payment terms to you under our Business Account Credit Program. </p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, on our website or in the applicable order process, each Web.com Service is for a one-year initial term and renewable thereafter for successive terms.
Any Web.com Service that provides for a monthly billing cycle may be billed every four (4) weeks.
Any renewal of your Services with us is subject to our then current Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, successful completion of any applicable authentication procedure, and payment of all applicable service prices and fees at the time of renewal, and in the case of domain name re-registration, the domain name registry's acceptance of your domain name registration.
Upon prior notice, Web.com may also charge an “Account Maintenance Fee” to maintain your active account.
This Account Maintenance Fee shall be billed to your account each year, thirty (30) days following the annual anniversary date of your account creation.
Except with respect to the Services to which you subscribe on a monthly (or similar billing cycle) basis, we will endeavor, but are not obligated, to provide you with notice prior to the renewal of your Services at least fifteen (15) days prior to the renewal date. </p>
<p>Pricing for Services, renewals, and product upgrades and add-ons may vary based upon the date of your purchase.
Additional payment terms may apply to the Services you purchase, as set forth in the applicable supplemental service and product agreements to this Agreement, on our website or as otherwise outlined in the applicable order process.
Services to which you subscribe to on a monthly or recurring basis automatically renew on a recurring basis until the Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with its terms.
We may, at any time, activate the auto-renew service for eligible Services in your account if it is not already activated.
Further, we may provide you with an opportunity to opt-in to our automatic renewal process in accordance with the instructions (and subject to your agreement to the terms and conditions pertaining to that process) on our website or in the applicable order process.
You agree that if you are enrolled in or otherwise utilizing our auto-renew service, we will attempt to renew your service at some point less than ninety (90) days prior to its expiration [without notice to you].
Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, may be for a shorter term than the term for which you originally purchased your Services, but in no event shall such term be longer than the term then currently in place for the Services.
Such automatic renewal for your Services, if successful, shall be at the then current price for the Services.
You further agree that, to turn off the auto-renew service for any of your Services with Web.com, you must call our Customer Service, or you may be able to turn off such auto-renew service utilizing the online Account Manager associated with your Services.
You acknowledge and agree that the renewal price may be higher or lower than the price you paid for the then current term of the Services, and that we are authorized to charge your credit card or other payment method on file for the renewal of the Services.
In any event, you are solely and absolutely responsible for the credit card or payment information you provide to Web.com and must promptly inform Web.com of any changes thereto (e.g., change of expiration date or account number).
You acknowledge and agree that Web.com may extend the expiration date on your credit card on file with us in order to protect against unwanted expiration of your Services and to allow for the automatic renewal thereof.  In addition, you are solely and absolutely responsible for ensuring the Services are renewed.
Web.com shall have no liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal as described herein, including, but not limited to, any failure or errors in renewing the Services whether due to you, us or a third party.
In order to process a renewal under our auto-renew service, we may use third-party vendors for the purpose of updating the expiration date and account number of your credit card or other payment method on file.
Such third-party vendors maintain relationships with various credit card issuers and may be able to provide us with the updated expiration date and account number for your credit card by comparing the information we have on file with the information the third-party vendor has on file.
By selecting our auto-renew service, you acknowledge and agree that we may share your credit card or other payment method information with such third-party vendors for the purpose of obtaining any update to your credit card expiration date, account number or payment account. </p>
<p>In the event that you are not enrolled in auto-renew, or have opted out of auto-renew, and want to renew your Services, you acknowledge and agree you are responsible for actively renewing your Services and you further assume all risk and consequences if you wait until the end of the Services term or otherwise to attempt to renew any Services.
If any Service is not successfully renewed prior to the expiration of its then current term, all your rights to such Service will terminate, and we will have no obligation to allow you to renew a Service once its expiration date has passed.
Additionally, for domain name registration services, even if a registry administrator or third-party service provider provides a grace period to Web.com upon expiration or termination of such Service, you acknowledge and agree that any post-expiration renewal or redemption processes implemented on your behalf are at our sole and absolute discretion, and may be subject to a late fee, reinstatement fee, redemption fee and/or other fee. </p>
<p>Without limiting any of Web.com's rights hereunder, should any fee payment become delinquent, Web.com may suspend or cancel your Services.
provided, however, related charges will continue to accrue.
You acknowledge and agree that Web.com is not responsible whatsoever for any effect the suspension of Services might have.
If Web.com provides any Service discount to you and you default on payments or obligations as outlined herein, Web.com may rescind all discounts and require full payment for the Services.
All sums due and payable that remain unpaid after any applicable cure period herein will accrue interest as a late charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.
Web.com further reserves the right to refer any amounts owed hereunder to a third party for collection in the event of default.
In the event your account is sent to collection, you agree to pay all costs of collection, including costs, litigation and attorneys’ fees.
A $20.00 (Twenty U.S.
dollars) collection fee may be charged for all dishonored checks.
Moreover, an additional fee may also be assessed for the following reasons: (i) late payment.
(ii) payment with insufficient funds.
(iii) denied or invalid credit card number.
or (iv) the re-starting or reinstating of Services terminated for nonpayment.
Web.com will re-start or reinstate any such Service in our sole and absolute discretion and subject to our receipt of the applicable service fee, renewal fee or other fee. </p>
<p>If Customer pays for the Services by credit card or charge card, Customer permanently and irrevocably waives any and all right to enact a ‘chargeback' (that is, a disputed, reversed or contested charge with the applicable bank, credit card, charge card or other payment method) against these payments for any reason whatsoever against Web.com.
If for any reason Web.com is unable to charge your Account or other payment method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Web.com receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Account or other payment method, you agree that we may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including, but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any your Services (including domain names).
We also reserve the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for (i) additional tasks we may perform outside the normal scope of the Services.
(ii) additional time and/or costs we may incur in providing the Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion).
Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to: (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention.
(ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Web.com staff or by outside firms retained by us.
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Web.com as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or other payment method processor.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Account or other payment method you have on file with Web.com. </p>
<p>CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ALL WEB.COM FEES AND CHARGES ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THAT WEB.COM MAY CHANGE ANY PRICE, FEE, RATE OR PLAN AT ANY TIME UPON NOTICE TO CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 26 (NOTICE) OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p>

TERMINATION </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>A.
Generally.</strong> Web.com may terminate this Agreement immediately for any or no reason and without notice to you.
Without limiting the foregoing, Web.com reserves the right to suspend or terminate all Services immediately without notice to you if Web.com determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that you have failed to comply with your obligations as set forth in this Agreement.
In the event of your chargeback by a credit card, charge card or other payment method, or other non-payment by you in connection with your payments of the applicable billing cycle fee, renewal fee or other applicable fee, you acknowledge and agree that all of your Services may be suspended, canceled or terminated, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you. </p>
<p>Unless otherwise stipulated in the related order process, you may terminate this Agreement and the Services by calling Web.com Customer Service, whereby this termination request may be recorded, and the Services will terminate as of the end of the applicable, current billing period.
You are responsible for all fees incurred up to and including the date of termination and upon termination you may receive a final bill reflecting the balance due for any remaining charges and agrees to pay all such fees incurred by you and/or via your utilization of the Services.
If you order any Services by telephone and do not agree to be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions at that time, you must notify Web.com within seventy-two (72) hours from the time that Web.com has sent you a welcome e-mail to your account e-mail address on record, that you desire to cancel such Services, whereby the Services will be cancelled, and a refund of any payments or fees already paid to Web.com with respect to the order of the Services will be issued, with no further obligation by either Party.
Your failure to notify Web.com of cancellation of any Services as described above will indicate that you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood these Terms and Conditions and agree to be legally bound by them. </p>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or on our website, Web.com will cease charging your credit card, if applicable, for any monthly service fees as of the expiration of the billing cycle in which the termination is effective.
Unless otherwise specified in writing by Web.com, you will not receive any refund for payments already made by you as of the date of termination, regardless of whether any related Services have been performed, and you may also incur additional fees and/or be obligated to pay us for the balance of your term (in the case of a monthly or annual subscription being paid over time, as provided in various supplemental service and product agreements).
If termination of this Agreement is due to your default hereunder, you shall bear all costs of such termination, including any reasonable costs Web.com incurs in closing your account and you further agree to pay any and all costs incurred by Web.com in enforcing your compliance with this Section.
Upon termination, you must destroy any copy of the materials licensed to you hereunder and referenced herein.
You agree that upon termination or discontinuance for any reason, we may delete all information related to you on the Service, if applicable.
In addition to the terms set forth herein, certain Web.com Services may have additional terms regarding termination, which are set forth in the applicable supplemental service and/or product agreements.
Moreover, should you or we cancel or terminate your Services at any time prior to the completion of the applicable term, such cancellation or termination may result in our application of an early termination fee charged to your account, in our sole and absolute discretion and without notice to you. </p>
<p>
<strong>B.
Termination of Bundled Services.</strong> In addition to the Terms and Conditions set forth herein, if you purchase Web.com Services which are sold together as a solution or bundled package of Services, any termination relating to any one such solution or bundled package will terminate all Web.com Services included in such solution or bundled package.
For instance, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any domain name registered with or maintained by Web.com under this Agreement (but not including any domain names you may have registered, either with Web.com or a third-party registrar, separately and not as part of a bundled package) may be cancelled and may thereafter be available for registration by another party.
You acknowledge and agree that upon any termination or cancellation of your solution or bundled package, the Terms and Conditions regarding transfer of expired domain names as described in this Service Agreement may apply.
Upon the effective date of termination, Web.com will no longer provide the solution or bundled package to you, any licenses granted to you will immediately terminate, and you must cease using such Services immediately.
provided, however, that we may, in our sole and absolute discretion and subject to your agreement to be bound by the applicable agreements and to pay the applicable fees, allow you to convert certain Services included in the bundled Services to stand-alone Services. </p>
<p>
<strong>C.

<strong>E.
Use and Ownership of Images.
</strong>The Services may contain, utilize or otherwise involve photo images (the “Images”) and as such Web.com may provide the Images to you in the process of providing the Services.
The Images are either owned by Web.com or licensed from a third party.
Unless otherwise stipulated by Web.com, your use of the Images is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.
Provided you are not in breach of this Agreement or any of the representations and warranties contained herein, and provided you have paid the applicable fees, you may perform the following actions subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section (upon termination of the Services or this Agreement all of your rights and licenses in and to the Images will immediately terminate): </p>
<p>i.
incorporate the Images into your own original work and publish, display and distribute your work on the Website.
You may not, however, resell, sublicense or otherwise make available the Images for use or distribution separately or detached from a product or webpage.
For example, the Images may be used as part of a webpage design, but may not be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or intended for permanent storage or re-use by others.
Similarly, you may be provided with copies of the Images (including digital files) as part of work product, but you are not permitted to use the Images separately or as part of any other product; </p>
<p>ii.
back up, copy, or archive the Images as necessary for internal use, and only as necessary for that use.  Any copy or archive you make must include the Image's copyright information.
and </p>
<p>iii.
in the normal course of workflow, convey to a third party (such as a printer) temporary copies of the Images that are integral to your work product and without which the product could not be completed. </p>
<p>With respect to the use of any Images, you may not: </p>
<p>i.
create scandalous, obscene, defamatory or immoral works using the Images, nor use the Images for any other purpose which is prohibited by law; </p>
<p>ii.
use the Images or any part of it as part of a trademark, service mark or logo.
Web.com and those third parties from whom they have licensed images retain the full rights to the Images, and therefore you cannot establish their own rights over any part of the Images; </p>
<p>iii.
remove any copyright or trademark from any place where it appears on the Images or its accompanying materials; </p>
<p>iv.
rent, lease, sublicense or lend the Images, or a copy thereof, to another person or legal entity without the express written consent of Web.com; </p>
<p>v.
transfer the rights to the Images, accompanying materials or storage media for the Images, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.

<p>vi.
reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Images, accompanying materials or storage media for the Images, subject to applicable law; </p>
<p>vii.
copy or reproduce the Images, accompanying materials or storage media for the Images; </p>
<p>viii.
display the Images in any digital format or for any digital use at a resolution greater than 640x480 pixels, except in editorial or preliminary design work.
Doing so will be viewed as an attempt to distribute the Images in violation of this Agreement; </p>
<p>ix.
re-sell, distribute or sub-license the Images, storage media for the Images, or the rights to use the Images to anyone for any purpose, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.
