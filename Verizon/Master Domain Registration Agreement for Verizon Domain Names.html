<strong>1.
IN THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</strong> ("Agreement"), "Registrant", "you" and "your" refers to the Registrant of each domain name registration, "we", "us" and "our" refers to Tucows.com Co., and "Services" refers to the domain name registration services provided by us as offered through Verizon Online LLC and its affiliates, Verizon Online - Maryland LLC and Verizon Online Pennsylvania Partnership, the Registration Service Provider ("Verizon").
Any reference to a "registry," "Registry" or "Registry Operator" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain ("TLD").
This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us for the Services.
By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth by a registry for that particular registry only.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
SELECTION OF A DOMAIN NAME.
</strong>You acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of your application.
You represent that, to the best of the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the manner in which you intend to use it, infringes upon the legal rights of a third party and further, that the domain name is not being registered for, nor shall it at any time whatsoever be used for, any unlawful purpose.
During the period following registration of a domain name and the appointment of active name servers, we may post a stagnant web page and any revenues generated from same shall be for our own account.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
FEES.</strong> As consideration for the Services, you agree to pay Verizon the applicable service(s) fees prior to the effectiveness of a desired domain name registration or any renewal thereof.
All fees payable hereunder are non-refundable even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term.
As further consideration for the Services, you agree to: (1) provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you as required by the registration process, and (2) maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate.
All such information shall be referred to as account information ("Account Information").
You represent that the Account Information and all other statements put forth in your application are true, complete and accurate.
Both Tucows and each registry reserves the right to terminate your domain name registration if: (i) information provided by you or your agent is false, inaccurate, incomplete, unreliable, misleading or otherwise secretive.
or (ii) you have failed to maintain, update and keep your Account Information true, current, complete, accurate and reliable.
You acknowledge that a breach of this Section 3 will constitute a material breach of our Agreement, which will entitle either us or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
TERM.
</strong>This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of your domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the time of registration or any renewal thereof.
Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT.</strong> You acknowledge that the practice of registering and administering domain names is constantly evolving.
therefore, you agree that Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances.
All amendments to this Agreement will be posted on our website.
Your continued use of the domain name registered to you will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions.
If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name registration be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited registrar.
You agree that such cancellation or request for transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong> In order to change any of your account information with us, you must use the Account Identifier and Password that you selected when you opened your account with us.
You agree to safeguard your Account Identifier and Password from any unauthorized use.
In no event shall we be liable for the unauthorized use or misuse of your Account Identifier or Password.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
NO GUARANTEE.
</strong>You acknowledge that registration or reservation of your chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation or use of the domain name.</p>

DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES.</strong> You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry.
You agree that in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy.
If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend your ability to use your domain name or to make modifications to your registration records until (i) Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or (ii) Tucows receives notification by you and the other party contesting your domain that the dispute has been settled.
Furthermore, you agree that if you are subject to litigation regarding your registration or use of your domain name, Tucows may deposit control of your registration record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate from us.</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
POLICY.
</strong>You agree that your registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by us or a registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.</p>
<p>
<strong>10.
AGENCY.
</strong>Should you intend to license use of a domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of record and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name.
You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name.
You represent that you will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement</p>

<p>
<strong>13.
INDEMNITY.
</strong>You agree to release, indemnify, and hold Tucows, its contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates, ICANN, the applicable registries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees, of third parties arising out of or relating to the registration or use of the domain name registered in your name, whether used by yourself, licensed to a third party or pursuant to the Whois Privacy Service, including without limitation infringement by you or a third party with access to your Account Identifier and Password.
You also agree to release, indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy.
When we are threatened with suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify us.
your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in the suspension or cancellation of your domain name.
This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>14.
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.</strong> The person named as Registrant on the Whois shall be the registered name holder.
The person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account identifier and password are secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name.
You agree that prior to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the "Transferee") you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void.</p>
<p>
<strong>15.
RENEWALS AND FORFEITURE.</strong> Domain names are registered for a finite period of time.
You will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration of your registration inviting you to renew your domain name and specifying the amount of time you have to renew your domain name.
In the event that you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, your registration will expire and we may, at our discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it for our own account, delete it or we may sell it to a third party.
You acknowledge and agree that your right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration and that any expired domain name may be made available for registration by a third party.</p>
<p>If you fail to renew your registration, your domain name may cease to resolve and visitors to your site may be redirected to a default page informing them that the site is no longer in service.
This parked or default page may feature advertisements posted by us for our own account.</p>
<p>If we, in our sole discretion, have elected to renew the registration, you will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which you may re-register the domain name from us.
Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply.
During this grace period, we may post a parked page and/or may revise the "Whois" registration records to include either our information or that of Verizon.
The domain name also may be listed for auction and promoted as being available for auction.
If the name is sold during any such auction, it will be acquired by a third party and will not remain available for re-registration by you after our stated grace period.
If you do not re-register the domain name during the grace period, the auction sale will be concluded and ownership of the domain transferred to a third party.</p>
<p>If you fail to renew your domain name registration during the grace period, you acknowledge that you have abandoned the domain name and that it is available for sale and registration by any third party.</p>
<p>
<strong>16.
BREACH.
</strong>You agree that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy provided by us, may be considered by us to be a material breach and that we may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to you.
If within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to us, that you have not breached your obligations under the Agreement, then we may delete the registration or reservation of your domain name.
Any such breach by you shall not be deemed to be excused simply because we did not act earlier in response to that, or any other breach by you.</p>
