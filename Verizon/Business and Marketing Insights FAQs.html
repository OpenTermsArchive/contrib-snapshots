<li> What are business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>Business and marketing insights are observations about groups or categories of people used to better understand consumer actions in aggregate.
The program develops insights using information Verizon and Oath have about their users.
Insights do not identify individuals.
For example, a company may find it valuable to know the number of customers in different age groups who visited a website, used an app, or visited a retail store or stadium.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> Will I ever be personally identified in a business and marketing insight? <p>
</p>
<p>No, insights are developed about groups or categories of consumers and do not identify you personally.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> What kind of data is used to prepare business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>Information used by the Business and Marketing Insights program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your Verizon Wireless device and its use including web addresses of sites you visit and similar information about apps and features you use,</li>
<li>Information about your Verizon Wireless device location, including network data and location information transmitted by apps or sites you permit to use your device location,</li>
<li>Information about your Verizon products and services and how you use them (such as data and calling features and use, and device types),</li>
<li>Information about your Oath services (such as email, search, sites and apps) and visits to third-party websites and apps that include Oath services (such as web browsing, app usage and location),</li>
<li>Information you provide or that Verizon or Oath obtain from other companies (such as demographics and interests), and</li>
<li>Information other companies share with us to better understand insights related to their own businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Business and Marketing Insights program combines and analyzes this information in a manner that does not identify you personally to prepare insights.
Verizon may also share location information in a way that does not personally identify you so that others can produce additional aggregate insights.
For example, de-identified location information we provide could be combined with similar information provided by others to create traffic reports.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> Will the program use information from my emails to develop these business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>As explained in the Oath privacy policy, the program may use de-identified information about Oath services you use to communicate with others, including information from emails.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> Will the program use information from my online bank account (or other accounts where I register to perform secure transactions) to develop these business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> What types of Verizon accounts and devices are included in the development of business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>Most Verizon Wireless consumer and small business accounts are included in the development of business and marketing insights.
This includes mobile phones, tablets, mobile hotspots, netbooks and USB modems.
Corporate, government and prepaid accounts are not included.<br>
<br>
If you share your mobile hotspot with others, data transmitted using that hotspot is collected and used to develop business and marketing insights.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> If I turn off the location services settings on my mobile device, will my location information still be collected and used for business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>This program may use two types of location information.
First, with your permission, it may use location information we collect from apps or mobile websites.
This type of data will not be collected if you turn off the location service settings on your device.
The program also uses location information that Verizon collects from our network.
This type of location information will continue to be used even if you turn off the location service settings on your device.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> Do I have a choice about the use of my Verizon information for business and marketing insights? <p>
</p>
<p>Yes.
If you don't want your Verizon information used for this program, you can opt out at any time at the privacy choices page on MyVerizon, on your device in the My Verizon app, or by calling (866) 211-0874.
Please note, if you agree to participate in the Verizon Selects advertising program, you will also be part of the Business and Marketing Insights program independent of your choice here.
Also, Oath information may continue to be used for insights even if you have opted out of the use of your Verizon information.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> Will the Business and Marketing Insights program share my personal information with third parties? <p>
</p>
<p>We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of this program other than with vendors and partners who do work for us.
We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us.</p>
