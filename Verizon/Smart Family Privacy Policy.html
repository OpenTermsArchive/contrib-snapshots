 Privacy Policy Smart Family Privacy Policy <p>Smart Family service allows you to monitor the call and text activity, set time restrictions and usage limits, and establish content filters for each device on your account.
Smart Family Premium service gives you all the features of Smart Family and also allows you and your family to locate each other’s devices.</p>
<p>Smart Family’s privacy practices are covered by the Verizon Privacy Policy as well as the Smart Family-specific practices described here.
In the event of a conflict between the two policies, the practices described in this policy govern when you are using Smart Family services.</p>
Information we collect and how it is used
<p>We collect information when you set up Smart Family services, including the content filters and time and usage restrictions you choose for your lines of service and the name and age of users for lines you designate as child lines.
The Verizon Privacy Policy explains additional information that we collect.</p>
<p>When Smart Family services are used, we may collect the approximate device location based on cellular network information.
When you download and use the Smart Family parent app or companion app, we may also collect device identifiers and precise device geolocation.
This information may be collected from all lines on your account, including lines you designate as child lines which you may choose to be used by children under the age of 13. When you set up content filtering for a companion device, the companion app will access the companion device’s IP address and the websites and apps requested by the companion device.</p>
<p>Information we collect is used to deliver, maintain and support Smart Family services, including to provide you and your family with location information for the devices on your account, and for analytics.</p>
<p>We do not collect more information from designated child lines than is reasonably necessary to render Smart Family services.
Smart Family does not allow children to make their personal information publicly available.</p>
Information we share
<p>We share personal information with vendors and partners who do work on our behalf.
These vendors and partners may use personal information shared with them only for purposes related to providing Smart Family services to you.</p>
Your choices
<p>When setting up Smart Family services, parents are asked to provide consent for the Smart Family app to collect device identifiers and geolocation from designated child lines for the purpose of providing precise geolocation services.
At any time, parents may revoke such consent.
However, without such consent, Smart Family precise device geolocation services will not be available for those child lines.
Parents may also review the device identifier and geolocation information that has been collected from designated child lines.  For more information or assistance with these choices, please contact Smart Family at verizonsmartfamily@verizonwireless.com.</p> Privacy Policy <ul>
