The Services will be performed in accordance with this Agreement and the additional terms in an applicable Insertion Order ("IO").</p>
<p>1.2.
<strong>Services Rendered.</strong> The purpose of the Services, subject to the terms herein, is: (i) to allow Indeed to create and host a mobile-optimized version of Customer's existing job application website (hereinafter referred to as the "Customer Branded Indeed MoBolt Website").

Indeed shall use commercially reasonable efforts to begin working on a resolution to Customer's written notice of reported problems within fourteen (14) days, provided corrections shall be prioritized in Indeed's reasonable discretion.

to 5:00 P.M.

<strong>Service Availability.</strong> Indeed's goal is to provide Service Availability of the Customer Branded Indeed MoBolt Website twenty-four hours per day, seven (7) days per week (referred to as "24x7 Availability") EXCEPT during times of scheduled internal updates.
However, the parties recognize that 24x7 Availability is only a goal.
Indeed cannot guarantee that such goal can be achieved.
These response time goals apply only to public production servers (i.e.
web servers, application servers, and database servers).
Indeed shall use reasonable efforts to achieve 99% Service Availability in North America.
The Service Availability goal excludes any time Customer requests the Services be paused and the Customer Branded Indeed MoBolt Website be taken down.
Indeed does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from Indeed's network and other portions of the Internet.
Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet services provided or controlled by third parties.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that from time to time the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions.
(ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs that Indeed may undertake from time to time.
and (iii) causes beyond the control of Indeed or that are not reasonably foreseeable by Indeed, including, without limitation, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, network congestion or other failures.
At times, actions or inactions of such third parties can impair or disrupt Customer's connections to the Internet (or portions thereof).
Although Indeed will use reasonable efforts to take actions it deems appropriate to remedy and avoid such events, Indeed cannot guarantee that such events will not occur.
Accordingly, Indeed disclaims any and all liability resulting from or related to such events.</p>
<p>3.3.
<strong>Third Parties.</strong> Indeed shall have the right to use third parties, including employees of Indeed's affiliates and subsidiaries ("Subcontractors") in performance of its obligations and services hereunder and, for purposes of this Section, all references to Indeed or its employees shall be deemed to include such Subcontractors.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.

<strong>Indeed General EEA Safe Harbor Notice</strong>
<p>
<strong>Scope of Safe Harbor Certification</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed Inc.
(“Indeed” or “we”) recognize that the European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, which applies to the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and that Switzerland (“CH”) has also established a data protection regime which applies to CH that restricts companies in the EEA/CH in transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the United States.
To create such “adequate protection” and allow our subsidiaries and business partners to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and Swiss legislation, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor Principles”) with respect to personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that we receive from our subsidiaries, customers and other business partners.
Our Safe Harbor Certification does not extend to data that we receive directly through Indeed’s publicly accessible websites.
More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and Indeed’s scope of participation is available at https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=27770.</p>
<p>
<strong>Scope of this Notice</strong>
</p>
<p>This Notice does not apply to employees of Indeed or our subsidiaries.
this Notice addresses other data subjects residing in the EEA and CH (collectively, “EEA Persons”) whose data we may receive from one of our subsidiaries, customers, suppliers or other business partners in the EEA/CH e.g., referral partners, integration partners, etc.</p>
<p>
<strong>Categories of EEA Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We receive certain information related to individual independent contractors, and employees and individual representatives of Indeed Inc.’s corporate business partners (including vendors and advertising customers).
Such EEA/CH Data includes, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, and any other personal data that are affirmatively provided to Indeed Inc.
in order to manage our business relationship.</p>
<p>We also provide data processing services to affiliated and unaffiliated entities.
We process any information that such entities instruct us to process, on their behalf and subject to their direction, such as resume data of persons in the EEA/CH.
When we receive EEA/CH Data from another company in the EEA/CH for processing, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing depend on such other company (the data controller) and on the relationship the data controller has with the relevant data subjects.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect and use EEA Data for purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA Data on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>We share EEA Data with our subsidiaries, affiliates and contractors, who process EEA Data on behalf of the Indeed Group.
We also share EEA Data with other third parties for the purposes for which we receive the EEA Data (e.g., performance of contractual obligations and rights), and we may also disclose EEA Data where we are legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise) or the disclosure is permitted by law or the Safe Harbor Principles and we have a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.</p>
<p>With respect to marketing emails, EEA Persons may opt-out of receiving further email marketing communications from Indeed by sending an email to opt-out @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email) or by following opt-out instructions that are contained in each marketing email.
EEA Persons may also send an email to this address to ask to opt-out of disclosures to third parties, but such a limitation on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible for us to provide the requested services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Access and Review</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an EEA Person about whom we hold EEA Data, you may request access to, and the opportunity to update, correct or delete, such EEA Data.

<strong>Program Description</strong>

Detailed rules and information about the scope of this bounty program are available on our Bugcrowd page.
If you are a whitehat researcher that believes you have discovered a vulnerability in an Indeed product or have any other security inquiries, please sign up as a Bugcrowd Tester to be included in Indeed's Vulnerability Reward Program.
Vulnerabilities submitted outside of Bugcrowd will <strong>not</strong> be considered.</p>

<strong>Legal Notes</strong>

<p>Indeed will not issue rewards to researchers from countries on sanctions lists (e.g.
- Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria).
There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon your local laws.
