<strong>Cookie Policy</strong>
<p>Last Updated: June 1, 2016</p>
<p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to Indeed’s use of Cookies as follows:</p>
<p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”).
“Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Like most websites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website.
For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform.
We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li>
<li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website.
For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li>
<li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google for marketing purposes.
These Cookies allow us to display Indeed promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.</li>
<li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Website, or to associate user activity that Indeed referred to a third party website.
These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website, or give Indeed credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites.
We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.
Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.

Indeed may also provide an employer with code for a Conversion Tracker to place on its website that pings the job seeker web beacon and tracks whenever a job seeker has applied to a job on that employer’s website.
Indeed does not and cannot collect any of the job seeker’s personally identifiable information and does not have access to the cookies in the employer’s domain.
The Conversion Tracker is simply a counter that notifies Indeed that a job seeker has applied.
If a jobseeker has disabled the web beacon, the Conversion Tracker will have no functionality.</p>
<p>Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers.
Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Website.

<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>Last Updated: June 1, 2016</p>
<p>Indeed has created this Privacy Policy in order to describe its collection, use and disclosure of personal data you give to Indeed when you access or use Indeed’s online and/or mobile services and websites, and software provided by Indeed on or in connection with such services or websites (collectively, the “Site”).
“Indeed” or “we” means Indeed Inc.
if you are located in the United States, and Indeed Ireland Operations Limited if you are located elsewhere.
You may contact Indeed, Inc.
at 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA, and you may contact Indeed Ireland Operations Limited at 124 St.
Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.
or you may contact either company via our Site contact form.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers only data that we collect through the Site, and not any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, the data collection practices of any affiliate or other third party, including any third-party operators of web pages to which the Site links, and any information that we collect offline or through any websites, products, or services that do not display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
Occasionally, we may refer to this Privacy Policy in notices and consent requests related to special-purpose web pages, mobile applications, or other resources, for example, if we invite you to submit ideas to improve the Site.
under such circumstances, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through such special-purpose resources, as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g., with respect to the types of data collected or our uses or disclosures of such information)</p>
<p>Indeed may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
Please review the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was last amended.
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the “Last Updated” date indicated above.
By using the Site or providing information to us following such changes, you will have accepted the amended Privacy Policy.
If Indeed is going to use Personal Information (as defined below) collected through the Site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, then Indeed will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on Indeed’s Site for 30 days prior to such use or by other means as required by law.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Information Collected</strong>
</p>
<p>When you create an Indeed account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site, we collect such data including, but not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume.
In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., credit card number and related verification information).
If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
In each such instance above, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Indeed may automatically collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device, including, but not limited to, your browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site, and if you are accessing our Site with your mobile device, the type of mobile device.
In addition, we may automatically record and analyze actions taken on the Site including, but not limited to, date and times of use, clicks, page views, the amount of time you spend on each page, and search queries.
Indeed reserves the right to match your IP address (or any other information) with other information about you in any way permitted by applicable law.
Indeed will store this information on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with for that purpose.
If you create an Indeed account, information may be collected under your account email address.</p>
<p>If you access or use the Site on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address.
Indeed may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, geo-location or e-mail address.
We may also access your contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in the Site.</p>
<p>When a Job Seeker deletes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data which we provided under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, job alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data will not become available to the Job Seeker again.
Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a deleted account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights as allowed by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, to keep an email address).
A deleted account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name.
When the Job Seeker presses the delete account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.
Employers may disable an account, however Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.</p>
<p>

or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public.

We monitor, review, store and analyze your content (including your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, responses, offer letters and other materials) that you send, store or receive, including via automated means and otherwise, for data analysis, quality control, and to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for job seekers and employers, provide you with personally relevant product features, and to prevent fraud and reduce unwanted mail).</p>
<p>
<strong>Any information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with or transferred to any Indeed affiliated entity (including those located outside the European Union), no matter where located, for the purpose of providing you services and improving the Site.
By using the Site, you consent to this transfer and acknowledge that the services provided to you and the functionality of the Site could not be provided without such a transfer.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use other companies, including affiliates and third parties, to perform services in connection with our operations, and to improve the Site and our other products and services.
In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to Personal Information, and such Personal Information may be transferred to other countries.
Those companies are contractually required to treat such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be non-negotiable.
these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Information, by these companies.</p>
<p>You may also use certain third party sites or services that you link to from Indeed’s Site.
In such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to Indeed, and is subject to the third party’s privacy policy and terms of service.</p>
<p>Indeed may use your IP address and mobile device information to help diagnose problems with Indeed’s service and to administer the Site.
Your IP address and mobile device information may also be used to help identify you, your location, and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information (such as country of origin).
Indeed may maintain (as permitted by applicable law) information collected from you pursuant to this Privacy Policy following any termination of your relationship with Indeed.
Indeed may also delete such information as permitted by applicable law.
If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment.
Indeed may also aggregate your data with other data, for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Contact and Resume Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When you give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information, you agree that Indeed may utilize this information as set forth herein.
You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.
If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Indeed or its designated third-party partners may also use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts.
(ii) create an account.
and (iii) send you information about Indeed, including promotional materials.
Indeed may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on the Site, show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.
Your information, including Personal Information, gets placed on the Site when you upload or edit a resume.
To the extent you upload a resume or edit it, and subject to your Privacy Settings, you are making the resume, your name and other Personal Information that you place on your resume available to third parties who may be interested in you as an employee (and who may forward your resume and Personal Information to other third parties), to search engines, or to the general public by posting your Personal Information on the internet.
You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice-versa, in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to job seekers and employers).
If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name.
This means that third parties can view the Personal Information contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility.
If you do not want your Personal Information posted on the Site, you should not upload it.
You may opt-out of this feature on a going-forward basis by editing your Privacy Settings.
however, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.

<p>
<strong>1.
Job Listings</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may make available certain job listings and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (such listings and other contents, (“Job Listings”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
Job Listings are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control.
you acknowledge and understand that we have no control over Job Listings.
Except for certain sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Listings contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.

<i>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Job Listing, or to include any Job Listing in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Listing from the Site for any or no reason.</i>
</strong> We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness or any Job Listing or other information submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such employer or other user.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Listing.
You agree that Indeed may also provide search options to narrow down Job Listing search results by job type (i.e.
full-time, part-time, etc.), and such job types are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and are not a direct reflection of the actual Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(a) </strong>If you are a Job Seeker, any resume or application information that you submit through the Site is subject to this Agreement (including Section 4 below) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Without limiting the foregoing, however, please note that by creating a public Indeed Resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to any Employer that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume.
In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply (hereinafter, all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Apply from your phone” or “Apply with Indeed” are referred to as “Indeed Apply”) you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available that information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).
When you ask Indeed to transmit an application to an Employer via Indeed Apply, you understand that this is without warranty.
Indeed does not, however, guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any such resume or application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
In addition, by using Indeed Apply, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s application form, screener questions or its format and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer.
If you do not feel comfortable sending an application in this manner, do not use the Indeed Apply function and please send your application directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose.
Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
<strong>Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1(b) </strong>If you are an Employer, when you create a Career Site or post a Job Listing on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of Indeed’s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you and to the Job Seekers using such Career Sites or indicating an interest in such Job Listings.
You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply email relay function for use in connection with such Job Listing, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply.
Indeed is not responsible for the content of your application form, screener question or its format, and Indeed does not guarantee timely delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s application or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
You agree that Indeed Apply is presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.
You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
When you respond to or contact a Job Seeker who has used Indeed Resume, or Indeed Apply, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.
Additionally, you consent to Job Seekers’ applications and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
You are responsible for the contents of any Career Sites that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, including any questions for Job Seekers.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Career Site, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Site created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing).</p>
<p>
<strong>1(c) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, when you send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When you send, store or receive materials through or using the Site, Indeed may also inform a Job Seeker that an Employer has taken an action with regards to a Job Seeker’s application such as opening the application, viewing the application and making a decision with regards to the application, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any job listing, career site, job solicitation, screener question, answer to screener question, resume information you post, send or receive through the Site.
If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.
Indeed does not promise to correct any inaccuracy.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(d) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may use application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing, and vice-versa.
Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, you agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and presenting them to Employers as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
External Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>The Site contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and/or operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”).
You acknowledge that Indeed is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through, any External Sites.
You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p>
<p>In addition, Indeed may provide you with links to certain third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit.
We may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time.
If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk.
When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service.
We are not responsible for any content or services provided these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties.
We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party.
You will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not Indeed.</p>

<p>
<strong>4.
User Content</strong>
</p>
<p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums, may allow users to post Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site is referred to herein as “User Content”).
Such functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, facilitate communication, discuss ways to make career decisions, and to let users know of jobs.
User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names.
User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive.
Indeed does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein.
You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p>
<p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.
You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier.
Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences.
Indeed may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information.
Indeed reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.
</p>
<p>Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message, or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.
If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact Indeed immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal.
For clarity, Indeed does not have any obligation to remove any User Content, and the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site.

This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.
As an Employer, when you post a Job Listing on Indeed that you choose to list as confidential, your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Indeed reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers.
Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability.
Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements.
You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>
<p>Please note: Section 230 of the U.S.
Communications Decency Act provides that:</p>
<p>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</p>
<p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
<p>(2) Civil liability</p>
<p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-</p>

Claims of Infringement</strong>
</p>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

copyright, please contact us via our Site contact form.</p>

Prices for the Qualifying Purchases will be set solely by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>

<strong>1.
Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed Prime is an online tool that allows Indeed Prime Employers (“Employers”) to connect with Candidate Job Seekers (“Candidates”).
The term “Candidate” will refer to users of Indeed Prime who are seeking employment opportunities through Indeed Prime.
The term “Employer” will refer to a company that is interested in hiring the Candidates through the Indeed Prime online tool.</p>
<p>Users who wish to participate in Indeed Prime apply to Indeed to enter an Indeed Prime Weekly Talent List of Candidates (“List”).
Not all users who apply to Indeed Prime will be accepted into the program as a Candidate.
If Indeed chooses a Candidate to participate in Indeed Prime, they are placed into the List and they will remain in the List for such a time as determined by Indeed, as per Indeed rules, as set forth below.
Each week Employers who are using the Indeed Prime tool are shown those relevant Candidates in the List.
Employers may choose to interview Candidates from the List and conduct a hiring process with such Candidate if they wish.
There is a charge for use of this tool to the Employers, all as set forth below.
There is no charge to Candidates who are chosen from the List.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Applying to Indeed Prime</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidate:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as a Candidate you must create an Indeed account or login using your preexisting Indeed account, create a profile and apply.
When applying to Indeed Prime, we may require you to provide us with certain information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, skill set, salary requirements and geographic location.
At this stage, you will have the opportunity to block your profile from certain Employers.
We will use the information that you provide us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We may use a third party vendor to help us review your application.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to use Indeed Prime.
If you are accepted into Indeed Prime, we will notify you via email.
Once you have been accepted, a member of the Indeed Prime Talent Team (“Talent Consultant”) may reach out to via the email address or phone number you provided, and work with you to finalize your Candidate profile.
The Talent Consultant may continue to work with you throughout your time on Indeed Prime.</p>
<p>Employer:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as an Employer you must also apply.
Applying to be an Employer is free.
When applying we may ask you for additional information related to your company, including but not limited to, your name, email address, company URL, phone number and geographic location.
We will review the information that you provided to us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to Indeed Prime.
If your application is accepted, you will be notified via email and allowed to use the Indeed Prime online tool so as to engage with, and reach out to Candidates that are available in the Indeed Prime List.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Weekly Talent List</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>After a Candidate has applied and been accepted to Indeed Prime, he or she will be placed into the List to be viewed by Employers using the Indeed Prime tool.
Employers will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates in the List.
Candidates may receive emails from Employers informing them of their interest in the Candidate, and providing them details about the job solicitation.
Indeed has no input into the Employer’s selection process.
A Candidate may, but is not required to, respond to any Employer that has contacted him or her.
All requests for interviews by Employers through Indeed Prime do not guarantee a final job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary.
</p>
<p>A new Candidate may be highlighted as “new” in the Talent List.
At the conclusion of a certain number of weeks Indeed may remove any candidate on the List, at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion and, in such case, the Candidate must reapply through its Talent Consultant for consideration to be reentered into the List.
The reapplication process is at Indeed’s sole discretion, and not all re-applications will be granted.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>After an Employer’s application has been accepted by Indeed Prime, the Employer will be able to utilize the Indeed Prime tool in order to browse the Candidates in the List, communicate with these Candidates, and submit interview requests to Candidates.
Once an Employer has discovered a Candidate on Indeed Prime, the Employer agrees to make the first contact with the Candidate exclusively through the Indeed Prime tool.
After the initial contact, the Employer and the Candidate may use other means of communication during the hiring process.
The Employer agrees not to attempt to circumvent Indeed Prime by independently attempting to make the first contact with Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Indeed Prime.
If an Employer hires a Candidate from Indeed Prime, the Employer must report this hire to Indeed and will owe Indeed a fee (“Fee”) (as defined in Section 4 below).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Employer can establish that the Employer was in Negotiation with regards to hiring with the Candidate prior to utilizing the Prime tool, the Employer may be exempted from paying the Fee at the sole discretion of Indeed.
“Negotiation” shall mean at least one direct email sent out by both parties, Candidate and Employer, specifically to the other and not sent as part of a mass emailing, for the purpose of recruiting or hiring, within the three (3) months prior to the Employer using the Prime tool, and where no final decision to hire or reject a Candidate or to accept or reject the Employer has been made.</p>
<p>In the event an Employer circumvents the Indeed Prime process after discovering a candidate on Indeed Prime, or does not report a hire made through Indeed Prime, and thereafter hires that candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the candidate on Indeed Prime, Indeed Prime shall be entitled to 25% of a Candidate’s annual or term salary (if the term of hire is for less than one year) and all costs of collection of such amount, including any legal fees.</p>
<p>No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Employer through the use of Indeed Prime.
The Candidate is not obligated to accept any offer provided to a Candidate from an Employer that contacts them through Indeed Prime.
Additionally, offers or interview requests submitted by an Employer to a Candidate through Indeed Prime are not binding on the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed’s Role:</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agent by providing the Indeed Prime product.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Candidates and Employers to connect with each other.
Candidates and Employers are solely responsible for the information provided in any resume or profile, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Prime.</p>
<p>You understand that Indeed Prime does not inquire into the backgrounds of its Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of its Candidates or Employers, and that you are responsible for (1) conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer, and (2) complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or any corresponding state laws may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>

Indeed cannot guarantee that such goal can be achieved.
These response time goals apply only to public production servers (i.e.
web servers, application servers, and database servers).
Indeed shall use reasonable efforts to achieve 99% Service Availability in North America.
The Service Availability goal excludes any time Customer requests the Services be paused and the Customer Indeed MoBolt Website be taken down.
Indeed does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from Indeed's network and other portions of the Internet.
Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet services provided or controlled by third parties.

(ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs that Indeed may undertake from time to time.

At times, actions or inactions of such third parties can impair or disrupt Customer's connections to the Internet (or portions thereof).
Although Indeed will use reasonable efforts to take actions it deems appropriate to remedy and avoid such events, Indeed cannot guarantee that such events will not occur.
Accordingly, Indeed disclaims any and all liability resulting from or related to such events.</p>

<strong>INDEED GENERAL EEA SAFE HARBOR NOTICE (recognized until October 6, 2015)</strong>
<p>
<strong>Scope of Safe Harbor Certification</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed, Inc.
(“Indeed” or “we”) recognize that the European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, which applies to the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and that Switzerland (“CH”) has also established a data protection regime which applies to CH that restricts companies in the EEA/CH in transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the United States.
To create such “adequate protection” and allow our subsidiaries and business partners to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and Swiss legislation, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor Principles”) with respect to personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that we receive from our subsidiaries, customers and other business partners.
Our Safe Harbor Certification does not extend to data that we receive directly through Indeed’s publicly accessible websites.
More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and Indeed’s scope of participation is available at https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=27770.</p>
<p>
<strong>Scope of this Notice</strong>
</p>
<p>This Notice does not apply to employees of Indeed or our subsidiaries.
this Notice addresses other data subjects residing in the EEA and CH (collectively, “EEA Persons”) whose data we may receive from one of our subsidiaries, customers, suppliers or other business partners in the EEA/CH e.g., referral partners, integration partners, etc.</p>
<p>
<strong>Categories of EEA Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We receive certain information related to individual independent contractors, and employees and individual representatives of Indeed's corporate business partners (including vendors and advertising customers).
Such EEA/CH Data includes, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, and any other personal data that are affirmatively provided to Indeed, Inc.
in order to manage our business relationship.</p>
<p>We also provide data processing services to affiliated and unaffiliated entities.
Subject to a data-processing agreement including EU-approved standard contractual clauses, we process any information that such entities instruct us to process, on their behalf and subject to their direction, such as resume data of persons in the EEA/CH.
When we receive EEA/CH Data from another company in the EEA/CH for processing, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing depend on such other company (the data controller) and on the relationship the data controller has with the relevant data subjects.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect and use EEA Data for purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA Data on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>We share EEA Data with our subsidiaries, affiliates and contractors, who process EEA Data on behalf of the Indeed Group, according to a data-processing agreement including EU-approved standard contractual clauses.
We may also share EEA Data with other third parties for the purposes for which we receive the EEA Data (e.g., performance of contractual obligations and rights), and we may also disclose EEA Data where we are legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise) or the disclosure is permitted by law or the Safe Harbor Principles and we have a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.</p>
<p>With respect to marketing emails, EEA Persons may opt-out of receiving further email marketing communications from Indeed by sending an email to opt-out @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email) or by following opt-out instructions that are contained in each marketing email.
EEA Persons may also send an email to this address to ask to opt-out of disclosures to third parties, but such a limitation on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible for us to provide the requested services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Access and Review</strong>

<strong>Indeed Vulnerability Reward Program</strong>
<p>
<strong>Program Description</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of Indeed's commitment to the security of our job seekers, advertisers, and publishers, we partnered with Bugcrowd to launch our Vulnerability Reward Program.
Detailed rules and information about the scope of this bounty program are available on our Bugcrowd page.
If you are a whitehat researcher that believes you have discovered a vulnerability in an Indeed product or have any other security inquiries, please sign up as a Bugcrowd Tester to be included in Indeed's Vulnerability Reward Program.
Vulnerabilities submitted outside of Bugcrowd will <strong>not</strong> be considered.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Notes</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed will not issue rewards to researchers from countries on sanctions lists (e.g.
- Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria).
There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon your local laws.
Your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.</p>
