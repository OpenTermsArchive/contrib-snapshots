</ul> Webshots Blog <p>Last updated 02/17/2010</p> Webshots Privacy Policy <p> This privacy policy applies to the operations of all brands and services within the Webshots websites, including, without limitation, the Webshots desktop application and Toolbar, Daily Features Widget and the allyoucanupload.com service.
</p> Overall privacy statement <p>We take your privacy seriously.
Because we gather certain types of information about our members, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information.
This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
These privacy practices apply to the Website and its properties and services that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by our affiliate.
Please note that by using the services or website, you agree that any information you provide to us will be stored in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and United States law.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li> What information does Webshots collect? <p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services.
Several of the services and features that we offer on our sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage.
These include access to subscription-only areas, the ability to post opinions or other content, participation in sweepstakes or contests, surveys, subscriptions to print magazines and email newsletters and participation in message boards.</p>
<p>We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, mobile number and credit card information, when you provide it to us.
From time to time, we may also collect other sensitive information, such as your job title, gender, income bracket, age member name and password.
We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us.</p>
<p>Once you register with Webshots, you are no longer anonymous to us.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li> What is Webshots' practice regarding cookies? <p>Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites.
You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies.
Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below.
By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.</p>
<p>We also use technologies, including electronic images known as Web bugs (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons) that allow us to track general member-traffic patterns.
We may also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our site, and information about pages you visited.
Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you.</p>
<p>We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keeping count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites</li>
<li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Website and advertisement usage</li>
<li>Determining which features our overall member population likes best</li>
<li>Saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites</li>
<li>Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests</li>
</ol>
<p>We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters, to use tracking technology on your computer.
We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship.
Unless you visit the Website of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are.
Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
</li>
<li> How does Webshots use the information? <p>We use the information we gather for four general purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To customize the advertising and the content you see</li>
<li>To enhance the user experience in our network of sites and software applications.
We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages.
This helps us continue to build a better service for you</li>
<li>To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in paid services, polls, contests, surveys and message boards</li>
<li>To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you</li>
</ol>
</li>

When you use a cobranded service within our network of sites, you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service partner.
