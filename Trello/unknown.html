Atlassian also reserves the right to terminate Your accounts suspected of infringing copyrights upon the first incident without further notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you believe that any content in our Services violates your copyright, you should notify Atlassian's copyright agent in writing pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“<strong>DMCA</strong>”), 17 U.S.C.

<p>(3) identify the item that you think is infringing and which is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and include sufficient information about where the material is located (including which website) so that Atlassian can find it (such as the item’s URL);</p>
<p>(4) provide Atlassian with a way to contact you (such as address, telephone number, or email);</p>
<p>(5) provide a statement that you believe in good faith that the item identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law to be used by Atlassian.
and</p>
<p>(6) provide a statement that the information you provide in your notice is</p>
<ul>

<p>Atlassian reserves the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.
Accounts using business names or logos to mislead others may be permanently suspended.</p>
<p>But please note that Atlassian is not in a position to adjudicate complicated trademark disputes between third parties.  Therefore, we are not in a position to act on reports that require a complex legal analysis or factual investigation.  In those instances, we encourage you to contact the third party directly to try and resolve the matter.  In fact, you should consider doing so even before filing a report with us, as it is often more effective in resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>If we decide to take down content in response your report, please note that we will provide your report and contact information to the affected party, who may contact you directly regarding the matter.</p>
