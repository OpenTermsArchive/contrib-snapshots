</p> Children's Privacy <p> SAM encourages parents and guardians to supervise their child's use of the Internet.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without a parent's or guardian's permission when using the Internet.
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children.
For this reason, SAM generally does not request, collect, or store any personal information knowingly from children under 13.
</p>
<p> As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family's privacy on the Internet.
We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe.
In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected from Children"): </p>
<ul>
<li>We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</li>
<li> Personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by SAM or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.
</li>
<li> We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within SAM that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
</li>
<li> We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
</li>
<li> We will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13.
Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved.
</li>
<li> We will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13.
Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
</li>
<li>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</li>
<li>We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.</li>
<li> Upon request, SAM will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site.
SAM only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in an activity, game or service.
If we have collected and stored personal information from a child, we will give parents the ability to review their child's personal information, request that we discontinue further collection or use of their child's personal information, and/or request that we delete their child's personal information.
</li>
</ul>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent <p> Before any personal information is collected from a child under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating.
Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child's participation in the activity.
For every child under the age of 13, we will also require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as: by email plus a fax, phone or letter follow up by the parent or guardian.
mail, fax or scan of a consent form.
or toll-free phone call to SAM.
or other acceptable method.
</p>
<p> In order for us to provide notice to a parent or guardian and seek verifiable parental consent, we may request the online contact information of a parent or guardian.
</p> Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected From Children <p>In the following instances we will NOT get verifiable parental consent for the collection of a child's personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular customer service question).
We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding).
</li>
<li> Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription).
In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child.
The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe).
We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.
</li>
<li> Using persistent identifiers on our Website to support the internal operations of our Website which include: maintaining and analyzing the functioning of the Website.
performing network communications.
authenticating users.
personalizing content on the Website.
serving contextual advertising or capping the frequency of advertising.
protecting the security or integrity of the user, Website or service.
and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance.
A "persistent identifier" is a series of numbers that we assign to a user but cannot be reasonably used to identify a specific user.
</li>
<li>A child may provide the email address of their parent or guardian for the purpose of retrieving or resetting a child's lost password for their user account.</li>
