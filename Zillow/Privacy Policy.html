</ul> Privacy Policy
<p>At Zillow ("Zillow" or "we" or "us" or "our"), we appreciate your use of and contributions to our Web sites (defined to include all properties (mobile, web or otherwise) owned and operated by Zillow) and features (known as the "services").
Zillow respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.</p>
<p>This is our privacy policy and we will comply with it, as well as applicable U.S.
privacy law, when we gather and use information from users of our services.
We encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand what we do with the information we collect from you.</p>
Advertising-Supported Business Model
<p>The Zillow Web sites and our extensive set of features are generally funded through advertising dollars.
<br>This advertising revenue helps keep Zillow free of charge for our user community.
It also allows us to explore and build new features.</p>
<p>We strive to make advertisements relevant and useful to you.
Therefore, we may serve advertisements to you based on the information we collect from you or in relation to your interaction on our site.</p>
<p>We pledge to be transparent about the information we monitor and collect from you.
We keep information private between you and Zillow, except as explained below.
</p>
Collection of Information
<p>When you use Zillow's Web sites, we collect a variety of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Information you provide.</strong> When using our Web sites and services, you may provide information about yourself, such as name, address, phone number and e-mail.
This may occur when you register on Zillow, claim a home, or complete other forms, such as a loan request.
We may combine this information with other information we collect from your activity on our Web sites or from other companies.
You may also provide information about a third party on a Zillow Web site, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email.</p>
<p>In addition, when you order products or services from Zillow Web sites, Zillow may collect your credit/debit card information.
Zillow will use this information solely to complete your order and will not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the order or comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>In the event that a credit report is required to use a Zillow product or service, Zillow may collect your social security number ("SSN").
Zillow restricts access to SSNs to employees, vendors and subcontractors who require SSNs to support certain products and services.
Zillow strives to protect SSNs from unlawful disclosure and to keep them confidential by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable state and federal regulations.</p>

<p>In general, Zillow uses the information collected from you to communicate with you and operate our features and services.
Zillow also uses this information to present you with advertising that we believe will be of interest or useful to you.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important and we are committed to protecting information that identifies you personally, where you have chosen to keep it private.
We will only share personal information that you provide outside the public areas of our services in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<strong>Legal obligation or protection from harm.</strong> When Zillow has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the personal information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any requirement of law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce or investigate a potential violation of the Terms of Use, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security or technical concerns, or (d) protect the rights, property, or safety of Zillow, its users, or the public against harm.

This information does not personally identify individuals, but instead provides a helpful understanding of the groups of people who prefer certain types of information and services.</li>
