		<p style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">
			We collect personal data, which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, when you:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> subscribe to one of our publications; </li>
			<li> download and register to use one of our Apps or other Services; </li>

			<li> respond to one of our polls or surveys; or </li>
			<li> contact our customer service department with an enquiry, comment or suggestion. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Some of the personal data we request from you is required in order for you to use our Services.  If you do not wish to provide such personal data to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use the particular Service.  However, some of the personal data we request from you is optional.  This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you will still be able to use the Service.  If not all the personal information we request on a form is required, we may identify the required personal data to you such as by displaying an asterisk (*) next to the field where we request the required personal data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below are more detailed examples of where and how we collect personal data from you. Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the data we collect may be used for any purpose set forth in <strong>"How we Use the Information We Collect"</strong> below.
		</p>
		<p><em>Subscriptions:</em>
			When you subscribe to one of our publications, we ask you to provide your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and credit card or other payment information for the purposes of fulfilling your subscription, sending you invoices, contacting you about the expiry of your subscription, and sending you service messages about your subscription.  Once you are subscribed, we may store your subscription information, including its start date, renewal date, pricing, publication, and any customer service contacts you may have with us.
		</p>
		<p><em>Apps:</em>
			When you download and register to use one of our Apps, we collect from you information such as your name, mailing address, account number, postal code, and e-mail address. We use this information for purposes such as to look up your account in our records in order to populate your App with the content that comes with your subscription. We also assign a unique user ID to your App on your device so that we can identify you when you use the App and so that we can collect user metrics such as how you use the App. Unless you opt out on your device, we will send messages to your device when a new issue of our publication is available through our App.
		</p>
		<p><em>Product Purchases:</em>
			When you purchase products offered through one of our websites or publications, we collect your credit card and other payment information and keep a history of your purchases. We use this information for purposes such as to process your orders, to better assist you when you visit or contact us in the future, as well as to improve our product offerings when we send you information about these in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you return merchandise purchased via one of our websites or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to provide certain information, including your name, e-mail address, residential address and phone number. We collect and use this information for fraud prevention purposes, among other things.
		</p>
		<p><em>Online Registration:</em>
			You do not have to register to browse some areas of our websites. However, registration may be required to receive online newsletters or to participate in certain website features, such as a community forum. When you register, you will be asked for personal data such as your name, e-mail address, and a user name and password that you select. We collect this information to identify who you are, to provide you with the service or information you requested, and/or to facilitate your participation in an on-line forum or community. We may also use this information for other purposes, such as promotional and marketing purposes, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and not in violation of applicable law.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum or community areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is important for you to carefully consider what, if any, personal data you reveal in these areas. We may use information disclosed by you in this way to promote our products and services in our advertising communications, among other things.
		 </p>
		 <p><em>Information about Other People:</em>
				At some of our websites and through certain promotions, you can submit personal data about other people. For example, if you order a gift subscription and want it sent directly to the recipient, you would be required to submit the recipient's name and address. We do not use the recipient's personal data for any other purpose unless this is consistent with any further dealings which we may have with the recipient directly. We will also notify the recipient of this Privacy Policy.
		 </p>
		 <p><em>Promotions or Surveys:</em>
				When you enter a contest or sweepstakes ("promotion") or participate in a survey or poll ("survey") we may ask you to provide your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use the information we collect on promotion entry forms to administer your participation in the promotions and for other purposes stated on the entry form. Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and may be sponsored by our advertisers and partners. Information obtained through surveys is aggregated and used internally. We also share survey information with advertisers and marketing partners in an aggregated  form that does not personally identify you. In the event personal information is requested as part of a survey, such personal information will only be provided to unaffiliated third parties after ensuring that depending on the circumstances you have either consented or not objected.
		 </p>
		 <p><em>Optional Information:</em>
				Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like your age or gender) or information about your interests and purchasing preferences. In most instances, you do not have to provide us with this information to receive the publication, product, or service you have requested. When demographic information is required, it will be indicated, such as by an asterisk (*). We use this demographic and preference information to, among other things, tailor or improve our publications, product and service offerings, including our offerings to you where this is in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as well as for internal marketing research purposes.
		 </p>
			<p><em>Customer Service:</em>
				When you call one of our customer service representatives, or e-mail us with a comment or question, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, account number, postal code and telephone number, to help us promptly answer your question. We retain this information as necessary to assist you in the future, for instance with any further queries you may have. We also use your feedback, suggestions and comments to monitor and/or improve our publications, product offerings, and Services, among other things.
			</p>
			<p><em>Website Information:</em>
				We collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our websites and clickstream and other related information, such as information about your computer or device, web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to our site, the pages, content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next Web site you visit when you leave our site, and any search terms you have entered on our site. We use this information to monitor and improve our Services, among other things.
			</p>
			<p><em>App Usage:</em>
				We collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our Apps, such as information about your device, your use of our App, the pages, videos, other content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. We use this information to enable the App to function correctly on your device and to provide you with the appropriate content through the App, among other things. We collect your device’s geographical location for the purpose of presenting you with relevant content, provided that you have given your prior affirmative express consent via your mobile device.

			<p style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">
			<em>Cookies:</em>
			To enhance your experience on our Services, we place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services, and relate your use of the Services to other information about you. To learn more about how we use cookies on Services based in the EU, please visit the Cookie Policy linked to the EU-based Service you are using.
			</p>

			We use cookies (and Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services and to improve our content and offerings and to deliver advertisements that you might be interested in. For example, we use cookies to personalise your experience on our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings).
			<p>

			Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some of our content. However, your viewing of editorial content may be hampered. If you wish to block cookies, go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a> to find out how, or check your browser’s instructions.

			<p><em>Local Shared Objects:</em>
			Local shared objects, such as Flash cookies, also may be stored on your computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, see
			<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html
			</a>.
			</p>
			<p><em>HTML 5:</em>
			HTML5, the language some Web sites are coded in, may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Service usage activities. This information may be retrieved by us to help us manage our Services, such as by giving us information about how our Services are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.
			</p>
			<p><em>Cache Cookies:</em>
			Cache cookies, such as eTags, may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited a Service or Services in the past.
			</p>
			<p><em>Web Beacons:</em>
			Our websites may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. A web beacon is an electronic image called a single-pixel or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognise certain types of information, such as a user's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the web beacon is placed. These web beacons may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy above.

			 </p>
			 <p><em>Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information:</em>
			Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device’s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. You can withdraw your consent to the further collection and use of your precise device location data through any of our mobile apps by accessing your device’s privacy settings as further explained below in <strong>"Opt-out Choices: Precise Device Location Tracking."</strong> For information about how to reset your advertising identifier and your other opt-out choices relating to interest-based advertising in mobile applications, see <strong>"Opt-out Choices: Mobile App Advertising and Tracking."</strong>

			  </p>
			<p>
			These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf.
