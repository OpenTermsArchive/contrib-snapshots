 Print Oath Privacy Policy <p>
<strong>Last updated: </strong>June 13, 2017<br>
<br>
Oath and all of its brands (collectively, “Oath”) are part of the Verizon family of companies, which now includes Yahoo branded sites and our other affiliates.
Please note that the Yahoo Privacy Policy will apply on Yahoo branded sites and affiliated products, services, and technologies that link to the Yahoo privacy policy.
Additional privacy information is available in the Verizon Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We're always working to make our services even better.
One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in.
This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users.
There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>First</u>, the Oath Privacy Policy applies to Oath websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy.
To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</li>
<li>
<u>Second</u>, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.</li>
<li>
<u>Third</u>, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices for some of our Services.
Although this Privacy Policy applies to all Oath services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too.
Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use.
Products and services that do not link to this Privacy Policy, such as those offered outside of the United States as well as Yahoo branded and affiliated products (such as Tumblr and Aabaco Small Business), may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Oath Privacy Policy.
If there is a conflict between the Oath Privacy Policy and the Verizon or Yahoo privacy policies, the Oath Privacy Policy will apply when you are on an Oath product, service, or brand site that links to this policy and the Yahoo privacy policy applies when you are on a Yahoo product, service, or brand site that links to the Yahoo privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll let us know.</p> Information We Collect and Receive <p>
<br>
We collect and receive information about users in a few different ways:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<strong>Information you give us.</strong> You can give us information directly.
For example: <ul>

<li>When you post comments in response to a story or video on any of our Services, we-and other users-receive that information.
and</li>
<li>When you use the "My Portfolios" feature on DailyFinance, you can give us information about your investments so that we can provide you with up-to-the-second market news and commentary relevant to your holdings (your use of Oath financial features is subject to additional privacy terms).
and</li>
<li>When you otherwise contact us or provide us information directly.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<strong>To improve our Services</strong>
<strong>.</strong> We also use the information we collect and receive to provide content and advertising that people are likely to find relevant and engaging.

</ul>
</li>
<li>

By default, we defer to your AOL Service settings when collecting this information.
