</ul>Abusing eBay <p>eBay and its community of users (the "Community") work together to keep our sites, services, applications, and tools working properly and the Community safe.
Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.</p>
<p>eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program works to ensure that listed items do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our VeRO team through our Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program.
</p>
<p>Without limiting other remedies, we may, in our sole discretion, limit, suspend, or terminate our services and user accounts, prohibit access to our sites, services, applications, and tools, and their content, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep users from using our sites, services, applications, or tools, if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, shill bidding, conducting off-eBay transactions, manipulating Feedback, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing our employees or other users).
 We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a period of months, or to modify or discontinue eBay sites, services, applications, or tools.</p> Buyer Protection <p>Buyers and sellers share the responsibility for making sure purchases made on eBay are exciting, rewarding and hassle-free.
 We strongly encourage buyers to work with sellers before opening a claim relating to a purchase.
Buyers and sellers agree to follow the requirements of the eBay Buyer Protection Policy with respect to claims made under eBay's Buyer Protection Policy.
eBay Buyer Protection covers only claims filed in accordance with the eBay Buyer Protection Policy, not claims filed with PayPal.
eBay Buyer Protection will not cover claims for which the buyer has initiated another form of resolution processing, including credit card chargebacks (if the buyer paid by credit card) or PayPal Buyer Protection claims (if the buyer paid by PayPal). We may suspend the eBay Buyer Protection Policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the program.</p>
<p>We require eBay sellers to comply with our Buyer Protection resolution process.
Buyers and sellers permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any claim that a buyer opens with eBay under the eBay Buyer Protection Policy.
If we resolve a dispute in the buyer's favor, we will attempt to reimburse the buyer by reversing the funds from the seller's PayPal account used in the transaction.
If that is not possible, we will refund the buyer up to the full cost of the item (including any applicable sales taxes) and the original shipping, and we will require the seller to reimburse us for the amount due to the buyer.
We may place the reimbursement amount on the seller’s invoice and charge the seller’s automatic payment method on file with eBay, if any, for such reimbursement amount.
Without limiting the foregoing, sellers may not have to reimburse us for an eBay Buyer Protection claim if they provide the documentation (for example, delivery confirmation or proof that the item was as described) indicated in the eBay Buyer Protection Policy.
In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sellers must have a reimbursement method on file with eBay and agree to allow us to charge the method they designate for amounts due to buyers.
Sellers may change this reimbursement method by contacting eBay and searching for "How to change your reimbursement method."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their PayPal accounts for amounts due to buyers.
 Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their PayPal accounts in currency other than the currency of transaction that is the subject of the claim where they do not have sufficient funds available in that particular currency.
Sellers may opt-out of allowing eBay to remove funds from their PayPal account for amounts due to buyers by emailing PayPalReimbursementOpt-Out@ebay.com from their registered eBay email address and stating their user ID and intention to opt out of PayPal reimbursement.
However, we reserve the right to continue using seller PayPal accounts for eBay Buyer Protection cases associated with eBay transactions paid for before the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where there are insufficient funds in PayPal accounts or where PayPal is not the reimbursement method of a seller, we will require another reimbursement method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing a reimbursement method will not affect eBay's use of a payment method on file for other purposes (such as payment of your eBay fees).
If sellers do not provide eBay with a valid reimbursement method, we may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.
We may also suspend or restrict sellers from buying or selling on our sites and using our services, applications, and tools until payment is made.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Correcting Mistakes in Payments to Buyers or Sellers.
</b>We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover.
We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the eBay Buyer Protection refund or reimbursement.</p>
</li>
</ul>Holds <p>To protect against the risk of liability, eBay has at times requested, and may continue to request, that PayPal hold seller funds based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, riskiness of the listing category, or the filing of an eBay Buyer Protection claim. PayPal has held, and will continue to hold, seller funds pursuant to the terms of the PayPal User Agreement, PayPal policies and any other agreement entered into between PayPal and its users.</p> Cross-Border Trade <p>Many of our sites, services, applications, and tools are accessible to international sellers and buyers.
We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools.</p>
<p>Some eBay members may reside outside of the United States and some may not speak English as a primary language.
To assist users who speak different languages, we may translate listings and other eBay content, in whole or in part, into other languages.
If you are a seller, you may be able to opt out of our automated translation of your listings by, depending on the site, service, applications, or tool involved, using the functionality built into such site, service, applications, or tool.
We also may provide you with access to tools so you can request an on-demand translation of certain content on our sites, such as parts of a listing or a message from an eBay user.
If you request an on-demand translation from such a tool, the accuracy or availability of the resulting translation is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may be able to sell your items internationally by listing items for sale directly on one or more of eBay's international sites.
Using various tools, services, and experiences, we may display your listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale, including those situations where you choose to list items with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping and the Global Shipping Program described below).
However, you may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international shipping locations from your listings by creating and applying an exclusion list to your listings.
If your item is sold to a buyer on an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to that other site's policies and eBay's International Selling Policy.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale and shipment of items to international buyers.</p> Global Shipping Program <p>One of the ways that we may make your eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. The Global Shipping Program is designed to simplify international buying and selling on eBay. For items that are located in the United States and that you sell to an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you will simply ship the sold item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States.
There, a third party global technology and shipping provider will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item to your buyer. As a seller, there is no fee to join the Global Shipping Program. For items that are purchased by international buyers through the Global Shipping Program, buyers will pre-pay all applicable shipping and import charges during checkout and will benefit from international tracking of the item from the parcel processing facility through delivery.
</p>
<p>Unless you have previously opted into the Global Shipping Program, we may choose to make your listings available to international buyers through the Global Shipping Program after you have indicated your desire to take advantage of this program by accepting this User Agreement in the form of an electronic click-through.
If you do not accept the electronic click-through, you will not be able to take advantage of the Global Shipping Program, but you will still be bound by all other provisions of this User Agreement.</p>
<p>By accepting, you will also be acknowledging that you have read and agree to the Global Shipping Program Seller Terms and Conditions.
Those terms will apply to your participation as a seller in the Global Shipping Program and to all of your eligible new and existing listings following acceptance.
Those terms include, among other important provisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a third party agreement for the processing, customs, and international shipping services, including your consent to the disclosure of certain personal information in connection with those services,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a power of attorney authorizing third parties to act in your place to facilitate the export clearance of items that you sell through the Global Shipping Program,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a description of the items that are ineligible for the program and restrictions on the value, weights, and dimensions of items that may be sold through the program, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies governing the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following acceptance, you may later opt out of the program by adjusting your account settings within My eBay.
</p>
Fees and Services <p>Joining eBay and bidding on listed items is free.
We do charge fees for using other services, such as listing items.
The fees we charge for using our services are listed on our Fees schedule, which we may change from time to time.
Changes to that schedule are effective after we provide you with at least fourteen days' notice by posting the changes on www.ebay.com.
We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free listing days) or new services, and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event or new service on the sites or in our applications.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in United States Dollars.
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our sites, services, applications, and tools with a valid payment method by the payment due date.
If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
(This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and for accounts over 180 days past due, deducting the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.) In addition, you will be subject to late fees and we may suspend or restrict you from using our sites, services, applications, and tools until full payment is made. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.
If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.

Instead, our sites are venues to allow users to offer, sell, and buy just about anything, at any time, from anywhere, in a variety of pricing formats and locations, such as Stores, fixed price formats and auction-style formats.

We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular results will be achieved from following guidance we provide (e.g.
that your listing will sell, that a particular shipping option is the least expensive, etc.) While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, we have no control over and do not guarantee the existence, quality, safety, or legality of items advertised.

Release <p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. <b>In entering into this release </b>
<b>you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</b>
</p>
Access and Interference <p>eBay's sites contain robot exclusion headers. Information on our sites is subject to constant updates and changes.
Much of the information on the sites is also proprietary or is licensed to eBay by our users or third parties.
You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access our sites for any purpose without our express handwritten permission.
</p>
<p>Additionally, you agree that you will not: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take any action that imposes or may impose (to be determined in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copy, reproduce, reverse engineer, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, or publicly display any content (except for your information) from our sites, services, applications, or tools without the prior express written permission of eBay and the appropriate third party, as applicable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of our sites, services, applications, or tools, or any activities conducted on or with our sites, services, applications, or tools.
or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to our sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>Listing Conditions <p>By listing an item on eBay's sites, you agree to pay eBay's fees, to assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and to accept the following listing conditions: When you list an item on eBay's sites, your listing will be posted on eBay's sites and can be viewed in My eBay.
Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.
eBay's duplicate listing policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results.
 eBay reserves the right to end your listing for any reason.
Where and whether your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including, but not limited to, listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and shipping cost, feedback, and detailed seller ratings.
You can read more about where your listings appear in search and browse results in eBay's Help Pages.</p> Purchase Conditions <p>You are responsible for reading the full item listing, including any instructions the seller provides, before making a bid or commitment to buy. Unless otherwise stated, by making a bid or commitment to buy an item on eBay, you are committing to buy the item from the seller listing the item. If you make a commitment to buy or your bid is the winning bid or is otherwise accepted, you enter into a legally binding contract with the seller and are obligated to purchase the item.
For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.  </p>
<p>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.</p>
Privacy <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
We use your information only as described in the eBay Privacy Policy.
We view protection of users' privacy as a very important Community principle. We store and process your information on computers located in the United States that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices.
You can access and modify the information you provide us and choose not to receive certain communications by signing in to your account.
We use third parties to verify and certify our privacy principles.
For a complete description of how we use and protect your personal information, see the eBay Privacy Policy.
If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way please do not use our services.</p>
Indemnity You will indemnify and hold us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of eBay's sites, services, applications, or tools, and/or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
No Agency <p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this User Agreement.
</p>
Notices <p>Except as explicitly stated otherwise, legal notices shall be served on eBay's national registered agent (in the case of eBay) or to the email address you have designated on your account (in your case).
Notice to you shall be deemed given 24 hours after the email is sent.
Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the Registration Address associated with your account, as identified in your My eBay. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.</p> Legal Disputes <p>

<b>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures</b>
</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator also must follow the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or User Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.
In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of the completed form to us at the following address to initiate arbitration proceedings: eBay, Inc.
c/o National Registered Agents, Inc., 2778 W.
Shady Bend Lane, Lehi, UT 84043. </p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or eBay, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  </p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different eBay users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.  The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Costs of Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Severability</b>
</p>
<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.
The remainder of the User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>

<p>
<br>
<b>Abusing eBay</b>
</p>
<p>eBay and its community of users (the "Community") work together to keep our sites, services, applications, and tools working properly and the Community safe.
Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.</p>
<p>eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program works to ensure that listed items do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our VeRO team through our Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program.
</p>
<p>Without limiting other remedies, we may, in our sole discretion, limit, suspend, or terminate our services and user accounts, prohibit access to our sites, services, applications, and tools, and their content, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep users from using our sites, services, applications, or tools, if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, shill bidding, conducting off-eBay transactions, manipulating Feedback, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing our employees or other users).
 We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a period of months, or to modify or discontinue eBay sites, services, applications, or tools.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Buyer Protection</b>
</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers share the responsibility for making sure purchases made on eBay are exciting, rewarding and hassle-free.
 We strongly encourage buyers to work with sellers before opening a claim relating to a purchase.
Buyers and sellers agree to follow the requirements of the eBay Buyer Protection Policy with respect to claims made under eBay's Buyer Protection Policy.
eBay Buyer Protection covers only claims filed in accordance with the eBay Buyer Protection Policy, not claims filed with PayPal.
eBay Buyer Protection will not cover claims for which the buyer has initiated another form of resolution processing, including credit card chargebacks (if the buyer paid by credit card) or PayPal Buyer Protection claims (if the buyer paid by PayPal). We may suspend the eBay Buyer Protection Policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the program.</p>
<p>We require eBay sellers to comply with our Buyer Protection resolution process.
Buyers and sellers permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any claim that a buyer opens with eBay under the eBay Buyer Protection Policy.
If we resolve a dispute in the buyer's favor, we will attempt to reimburse the buyer by reversing the funds from the seller's PayPal account used in the transaction.
If that is not possible, we will refund the buyer up to the full cost of the item (including any applicable sales taxes) and the original shipping, and we will require the seller to reimburse us for the amount due to the buyer.
We may place the reimbursement amount on the seller’s invoice and charge the seller’s automatic payment method on file with eBay, if any, for such reimbursement amount.
Without limiting the foregoing, sellers may not have to reimburse us for an eBay Buyer Protection claim if they provide the documentation (for example, delivery confirmation or proof that the item was as described) indicated in the eBay Buyer Protection Policy.
In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sellers must have a reimbursement method on file with eBay and agree to allow us to charge the method they designate for amounts due to buyers.
Sellers may change this reimbursement method by contacting eBay and searching for "How to change your reimbursement method."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their PayPal accounts for amounts due to buyers.
 Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their PayPal accounts in currency other than the currency of transaction that is the subject of the claim where they do not have sufficient funds available in that particular currency.
Sellers may opt-out of allowing eBay to remove funds from their PayPal account for amounts due to buyers by emailing PayPalReimbursementOpt-Out@ebay.com from their registered eBay email address and stating their user ID and intention to opt out of PayPal reimbursement.
However, we reserve the right to continue using seller PayPal accounts for eBay Buyer Protection cases associated with eBay transactions paid for before the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where there are insufficient funds in PayPal accounts or where PayPal is not the reimbursement method of a seller, we will require another reimbursement method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing a reimbursement method will not affect eBay's use of a payment method on file for other purposes (such as payment of your eBay fees).
If sellers do not provide eBay with a valid reimbursement method, we may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.
We may also suspend or restrict sellers from buying or selling on our sites and using our services, applications, and tools until payment is made.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Correcting Mistakes in Payments to Buyers or Sellers.
</b>We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover.
We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the eBay Buyer Protection refund or reimbursement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
<b>Holds</b>
</p>
<p>To protect against the risk of liability, eBay has at times requested, and may continue to request, that PayPal hold seller funds based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, riskiness of the listing category, or the filing of an eBay Buyer Protection claim. PayPal has held, and will continue to hold, seller funds pursuant to the terms of the PayPal User Agreement, PayPal policies and any other agreement entered into between PayPal and its users.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Cross-Border Trade</b>
</p>
<p>Many of our sites, services, applications, and tools are accessible to international sellers and buyers.
We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools.</p>
<p>Some eBay members may reside outside of the United States and some may not speak English as a primary language.
To assist users who speak different languages, we may translate listings and other eBay content, in whole or in part, into other languages.
If you are a seller, you may be able to opt out of our automated translation of your listings by, depending on the site, service, applications, or tool involved, using the functionality built into such site, service, applications, or tool.
We also may provide you with access to tools so you can request an on-demand translation of certain content on our sites, such as parts of a listing or a message from an eBay user.
If you request an on-demand translation from such a tool, the accuracy or availability of the resulting translation is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may be able to sell your items internationally by listing items for sale directly on one or more of eBay's international sites.
Using various tools, services, and experiences, we may display your listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale, including those situations where you choose to list items with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping).
However, you may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international shipping locations from your listings by creating and applying an exclusion list to your listings.
If your item is sold to a buyer on an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to that other site's policies and eBay's International Selling Policy.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale and shipment of items to international buyers.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Fees and Services</b>
</p>
<p>Joining eBay and bidding on listed items is free.
We do charge fees for using other services, such as listing items.
The fees we charge for using our services are listed on our Fees schedule, which we may change from time to time.
Changes to that schedule are effective after we provide you with at least fourteen days' notice by posting the changes on www.ebay.com.
We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free listing days) or new services, and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event or new service on the sites or in our applications.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in United States Dollars.
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our sites, services, applications, and tools with a valid payment method by the payment due date.
If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
(This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and for accounts over 180 days past due, deducting the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.) In addition, you will be subject to late fees and we may suspend or restrict you from using our sites, services, applications, and tools until full payment is made. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.
If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.</p>

</ul>
<p>We may share your telephone numbers with our service providers (such as billing or collections companies) who we have contracted with to assist us in pursuing our rights or performing our obligations under the User Agreement, our policies, or any other agreement we may have with you.
These service providers may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded messages calls and/or SMS or other text messages, only as authorized by us to carry out the purposes we have identified above, and not for their own purposes.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that we are not a traditional auctioneer.
Instead, our sites are venues to allow users to offer, sell, and buy just about anything, at any time, from anywhere, in a variety of pricing formats and locations, such as Stores, fixed price formats and auction-style formats.
We are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers.
 Any pricing, shipping or other guidance we provide in our sites, services, applications, or tools is solely informational and you may choose not to follow such guidance at any time.
We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular results will be achieved from following guidance we provide (e.g.
that your listing will sell, that a particular shipping option is the least expensive, etc.) While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, we have no control over and do not guarantee the existence, quality, safety, or legality of items advertised.

<b>Release</b>
</p>
<p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. <b>In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Access and Interference</b>
</p>
<p>eBay's sites contain robot exclusion headers. Information on our sites is subject to constant updates and changes.
Much of the information on the sites is also proprietary or is licensed to eBay by our users or third parties.
You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access our sites for any purpose without our express handwritten permission.
</p>
<p>Additionally, you agree that you will not: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take any action that imposes or may impose (to be determined in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copy, reproduce, reverse engineer, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, or publicly display any content (except for your information) from our sites, services, applications, or tools without the prior express written permission of eBay and the appropriate third party, as applicable.
</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
<b>Listing Conditions</b>
</p>
<p>By listing an item on eBay's sites, you agree to pay eBay's fees, to assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and to accept the following listing conditions: When you list an item on eBay's sites, your listing will be posted on eBay's sites and can be viewed in My eBay.
Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.
eBay's duplicate listing policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results.
 eBay reserves the right to end your listing for any reason.
Where and whether your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including, but not limited to, listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and shipping cost, feedback, and detailed seller ratings.
You can read more about where your listings appear in search and browse results in eBay's Help Pages.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Purchase Conditions</b>
</p>
<p>You are responsible for reading the full item listing, including any instructions the seller provides, before making a bid or commitment to buy. Unless otherwise stated, by making a bid or commitment to buy an item on eBay, you are committing to buy the item from the seller listing the item. If you make a commitment to buy or your bid is the winning bid or is otherwise accepted, you enter into a legally binding contract with the seller and are obligated to purchase the item.
For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.  </p>
<p>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Privacy</b>
</p>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
We use your information only as described in the eBay Privacy Policy.
We view protection of users' privacy as a very important Community principle. We store and process your information on computers located in the United States that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices.
You can access and modify the information you provide us and choose not to receive certain communications by signing in to your account.
We use third parties to verify and certify our privacy principles.
For a complete description of how we use and protect your personal information, see the eBay Privacy Policy.
If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way please do not use our services.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Indemnity</b>
</p>
You will indemnify and hold us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of eBay's sites, services, applications, or tools, and/or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
<p>
<br>

Notice to you shall be deemed given 24 hours after the email is sent.
Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the Registration Address associated with your account, as identified in your My eBay. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.</p>

<b>Legal Disputes</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the eBay User Agreement (hereafter "User Agreement" in this section entitled "Legal Disputes"), your use of or access to eBay's sites, services, applications, and tools, or any products or services sold or purchased through eBay’s sites, services, applications, or tools will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</b>
<b>Please read this Section carefully.
It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved</b>
<b>.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>A. Applicable Law</b>
</p>
<p>You agree that the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in the User Agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>B.
Agreement to Arbitrate</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to eBay's sites, services, applications, and tools, or any products or services sold or purchased through eBay’s sites, services, applications, or tools shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER EBAY USERS.</b>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures</b>
</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator also must follow the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or User Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.
In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of the completed form to us at the following address to initiate arbitration proceedings: eBay, Inc.
c/o National Registered Agents, Inc., 2778 W.
Shady Bend Lane, Lehi, UT 84043. </p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or eBay, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  </p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different eBay users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.  The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Costs of Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Severability</b>
</p>
<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.
The remainder of the User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Opt-Out Procedure</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>IF YOU ARE A NEW EBAY USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ("OPT-OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE").
THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
</b> <b>YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO EBAY INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, 173 WEST ELECTION ROAD, DRAPER, UT 84020.
</b>
</p>
<p>For your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.
You must complete the Opt Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the eBay account(s) to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.
If you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate</b>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of the change.
The change shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay.
We will notify you of changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.ebay.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and by providing notice through the eBay Message Center and/or by email.
If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by the new terms.
</p>
<p>Moreover, if we seek to terminate the Agreement to Arbitrate as included in the User Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of the User Agreement not containing the Agreement to Arbitrate is posted to http://www.ebay.com, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of termination.</p>

Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes</b>

<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Salt Lake County, Utah.
You and eBay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
