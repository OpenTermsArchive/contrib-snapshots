It applies generally to the eBay.co.uk website and content and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page.
Some eBay-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies.
The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website.</p>
<p>In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc.
has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators.
These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc.
to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court.
  If you would like additional information regarding the Corporate Rules or contact us via the contact details below.</p>
<p>Our subsidiaries', affiliates’ and joint ventures’ privacy practices are similar to those described in this Privacy Policy.
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the global eBay trading community.
By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on 30 September 2011.

</li>
<li>
<p>shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies (for example, we may ask you to send us an ID or bill to verify your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity or ownership of an item you list);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to eBay, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law.
or if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information, such as your driver’s licence, credit card statement, or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information).</p>
</li>
</ul>Use <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customised experience.
You agree that we may use your personal information to: </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems.

</li>
<li>
<p>to send marketing communications via email (which you may chose not to receive at any time by changing your communications preferences in My eBay or following the instructions provided with the communication).
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>Marketing <p>We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
We may combine your information with information on other users and information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalise our services, content and advertising.
If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customisation programs, simply indicate your preference via the “Preferences” page in My eBay (or similar account status page) or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.
</p> Our Disclosure of Your Information <p>We may disclose personal information to provide our service, respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content infringes the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.
</p>
<p>We may also share your personal information with: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Members of the eBay Inc.
corporate family—like PayPal or Shopping.com—to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications.
Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you’ve requested their services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and customer support).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other eBay users, whether located within the UK or abroad.
For example, where you are involved in a transaction with another user, the other user may view your email address and obtain your contact information and postal address to help complete the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law enforcement agencies, other governmental agencies or third parties in response to a request for information relating to a criminal investigation, alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you or any other eBay user to legal liability.
The personal information we disclose may include your User ID and User ID history, name, city, county, telephone number, email address, fraud complaints and bidding and listing history or anything else that we deem relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eBay VeRO Programme participants in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate, either under confidentiality agreement or as required by law.
In such circumstances, we may disclose name, street address, city, county, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity.
(Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.
If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from those who attempt to carry out fraudulent or illegal activities on the site, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a legally valid request, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p> Information You Share on eBay <p>Your user ID is displayed throughout eBay (and so available to the public) and is connected to all of your eBay activity.
Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, shop fronts, feedback, ratings and associated comments.
Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy breaches on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items.
So, if you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.
If you are a business seller, your contact details (such as name and geographical address) may be visible on the View Item page, as you indicate in your business preferences on My eBay.
</p>
<p>If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, certain information about you, such as your user ID or reminders from eBay, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p> Using Information from eBay <p>eBay enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions.
We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users.
We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.
To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions.
When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.
In all cases, you must comply with data protection laws, and give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>
<p>You agree to use user information only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eBay transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using services offered through eBay (e.g.
escrow, postage and fraud complaints), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other purposes that a user expressly chooses.
</p>
</li>
</ul>Cookies <p>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyse our web page flow.
customise our services, content and advertising.
measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
For more information about why we use cookies, see Cookies, Web Beacons, and Your Privacy.</p>
<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control.
(For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.) </p>
</li>
</ul>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing <p>We and our users do not tolerate spam.
Make sure to set your eBay communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer.
You are not licensed to add other eBay users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent.
To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails to eBay, please report it to us.
You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would breach our User Agreement.
We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools.
If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose.
We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
</p> Account Protection <p>Your password is the key to your account.
Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your eBay password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify eBay and change your password.
</p> Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information <p>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to eBay.
Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely.
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it.
Upon your request to Customer Service, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.
We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our eBay User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p> Security <p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States.
We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorised access and disclosure.
However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site.
Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
</p> Third Parties <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
</p> General <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site.
All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted.
In addition, we will notify you through the eBay Message Centre or via email at the address you provide in My eBay.
If our help pages do not answer the questions you may have related to the Privacy Policy, you can write to the Data Controller within the European Union: eBay Europe S.à r.l.
– Privacy Policy Requests, 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, or you may contact eBay Customer Support.</p>
<p>If you do not feel satisfied with our responses, you may always contact your local data protection authority, who should forward your question, or contact the Commission nationale pour la protection des données in Luxembourg.</p> Our Previous Privacy Policy <p>This policy tells you about how we use and protect your personal information.

</li>
<li>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control.

</li>
</ul>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing <p>We and our users do not tolerate spam.
Make sure to set your eBay communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer.
You are not licensed to add other eBay users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent.
To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails to eBay, please report it to us.
You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would breach our User Agreement.
We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools.
If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose.
We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
</p> Account Protection <p>Your password is the key to your account.
Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your eBay password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify eBay and change your password.
</p> Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information <p>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to eBay.
Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely.
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it.
Upon your request to Customer Service, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.
We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our eBay User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p> Security <p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States.
We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorised access and disclosure.
However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site.
Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
</p> Third Parties <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
</p> General <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site.
All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted.
In addition, we will notify you through the eBay Message Centre or via email at the address you provide in My eBay.
If our help pages do not answer the questions you may have related to the Privacy Policy, you can write to the Data Controller within the European Union: eBay Europe S.à r.l.
