How we protect and store personal information Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.
We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.
We store and process your personal information on our computers in the U.
S.
and elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located.
We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration.
Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.
We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings.
We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations.
In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions permitted by law.
Third Parties Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.

eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
