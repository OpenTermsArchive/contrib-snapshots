<b>When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?</b>
</p>
<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay.
For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, shopfronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments.
Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.</p>

Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items.

Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and we encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect their privacy.
In all cases, you must comply with the applicable privacy laws, and must give the other user a chance to remove them from your database and them a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>
<p>You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage, fraud complaints and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates.
