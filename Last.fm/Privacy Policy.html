<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected about you by the CBS Services. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of the CBS Services. By using any of the CBS Services, you acknowledge the data collection practices and purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-information-we-collect">TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>When you use CBS Services, we collect a few different types, or “categories,” of information. This information generally falls within three broad categories: (a) the information you provide to us, (b) the information we collect automatically when you use our services, and (c) information we obtain from other sources. We describe this information, and the primary purpose for which it is used, below.  The full description of how we use the personal information we collect is also provided below.</p>

<h3 id="information-you-provide-to-us">Information You Provide To Us</h3>

<p>CBS Services collects information you provide to us, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Registration Information.</strong></span>
<em>When you register for certain services, complete any application form, or enter contests or competitions, we sometimes ask you for your name, email address, postal address, demographic information, and any preferences that you may have (e.g., which newsletters you would like to receive).  We use this to provide access to certain CBS Services, personalize them, and remember your preferences.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Billing and Payment Information.</strong></span>
<em>When you place an order with us or access a particular service, we will collect certain payment and identity verification information, including your name, email address, and credit card information. We use this to bill you for your use of the CBS Services.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Information You Post on the CBS Services.</strong></span>
<em>We collect personal information from you when you provide or post information to our Services, including your user name, comments, likes, interests, status, pictures and  references to your online presence. We make this information available to others, as you request.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Correspondence You Send Us.</strong></span>
<em>When you contact us directly by calling our offices or providing feedback, comments or suggestions on programs and other activities, we may collect the information you provide as part of your correspondence to Us. We use this to provide services to you and to learn about your interests and concerns.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Information You Provide About Others.</strong></span>
<em>Sometimes, you may provide information about others — for example, to refer a friend to certain CBS Services.  We use this to make the CBS Services available to the people you refer.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Information you Provide Offline.</strong></span>
<em>You might also provide personal information to us in person and offline. You may be recorded if you visit our offices (including by security surveillance of our premises, including CCTV), or attend a live performance or the taping of one of our programs as a member of a studio audience, or, if you submit sweepstakes entrance forms or an application to participate in one of our programs by mail or in person. We use this information to provide services to you, protect our security, and learn about your preferences.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="information-collected-automatically-through-cookies-and-other-online-tracking-technologies">Information Collected Automatically Through Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>We and our service providers operating on our behalf, other businesses who collect information on our pages,  may automatically collect or receive certain information associated with you and/or your device(s) as part of your use of the CBS Services through device-based tracking technologies such as cookies, pixels, tags, beacons, scripts or other technology. For more information about cookies and other tracking technologies visit <a href="https://privacy.cbs/cookies">privacy.cbs/cookies</a>.  The information we collect automatically includes geolocation data, such as (a) information that identifies the precise location of your mobile device (when you agree to allow an app to collect this) and (b) your IP address, which may be used to estimate your approximate location.  We use this information to ensure that the CBS Services work properly, and to deliver customized content and advertising, including personalized ads, to you.</p>

<h3 id="information-we-obtain-from-other-sources">Information We Obtain From Other Sources</h3>
<p>The CBS Services collect information about you from other sources, such as publicly available databases and other third parties that have the right to share your personal information.  The categories of information we get from these other sources include:</p>
