</ul> Let's talk about privacy, publicly.
<p>We know policies are important, but sometimes they get pretty confusing.
So, we wanted to give you everything you need to know about our privacy policy in one quick summary.</p> our pledge <p>We pledge to respect your privacy, to be transparent about our data practices, to keep your data safe, to never sell your personal data, to let you decide how your information is shared, and to only collect data that helps us improve our products and services.</p>
<p> If you want more information, you can peruse our full privacy policy.
And, if you have any questions, comments or concerns, email us at privacy@fitbit.com.
</p> WHAT WE COLLECT <p>From motivational sayings to fitness tips, we think it’s important to collect things that make us better.
That’s why we collect data when you use our products and services—because that information helps us get to you know and create a better experience for you.
And you deserve the best.</p> Device Info <p>We get your info to give you info.
When you activate a device, we ask for information like height and weight to personalize your stats.
When you use it, we collect data like number of steps you take or your BMI to show your stats and progress.
And when you sync, we collect data like sync time and battery level, to help you keep your tracker (and yourself) up and running.</p> Your IP Address <p>When you visit our site, we collect your IP address to make sure you’re getting the content that’s relevant to you and your location.</p> Cookies <p> Our policy on cookies—in life, and online—is that we like them a lot, in moderation.
When you visit our site, we use cookies and other technologies to improve what we do and how we do it.
Get more details in our Cookie Policy.
</p> Friends <p> When you add friends to your Fitbit account by email, we’ll use the contact information you provide to send them an invitation to join you on Fitbit.
But we promise not to add them to a marketing list or use their email after that.
</p> GPS and Location <p> Some features, like run mapping, require us to collect location data like GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs.
But we’ll only collect that data when you’re using those features.
</p> Account Info <p>Everything’s better when it’s tailored to you.
That’s why we save info like your email and date of birth when you make a Fitbit account.
And why, when you create a food log, set an alarm, upload a profile picture or add information to customize your experience, we store that information in your account.</p> Your Contact Info <p> We’ve tried, but we just can’t get the psychic thing down.
So, when you contact us for help, we collect your name, email, and the details of your request to make sure we get you the answers you need.
</p> Purchase Details <p> When you buy from our store, we save your shipping address so we can process your order through our fulfillment partner.
And because you’d be bummed if your new tracker went to someone else.
But we don’t view or store your credit card information.
</p> Social Media <p> If you use Facebook or Google+ to create your account, or if you connect your Fitbit account with those accounts, we’ll ask for permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name, profile picture, and friend list.

</i> WHY WE COLLECT DATA <p>We’re not in the data business, we’re in the fitness business.
So we only use data to provide you with the best experience possible and to help you make the most of your fitness.</p> To get smart <p>We use your personal information like height, weight, gender and age to be more accurate about the stats your device is tracking (ex: how many calories you burn).</p> To protect you <p>We may use data and logs to research, understand, troubleshoot and improve our products and services, to protect against error or criminal activity, and to enforce our Terms of Service.</p> To stay in touch <p>We use your contact info so we can send you notifications, allow other Fitbit users to add you as a friend, and—if you give us the OK—to inform you about new features or products we think you might like.
</p> To do better <p> We use de-identified data (data that does not identify you personally) to share general information about people’s activities.
For example, we might create an infographic about popular summer workouts to use in a new marketing email.
</p> How We Use It <i>
</i> Who we sell personal data to <p>No one! We don’t sell data that could identify you to anyone, anywhere, anytime.
Ever.
Period.
That’s all, folks.
And we only share it when you tell us to, if we’re required to by law or to protect Fitbit.</p> Data That Doesn’t Identify You <p>Fitbit may share or sell aggregated, de-identified data that can’t be linked back to you, with partners and the public in a variety of ways, such as by providing research or reports about health and fitness or as part of our Premium membership.</p> Data That Could Identify You <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is data that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, or data that could reasonably be linked back to you.
We will only share this data under extremely limited circumstances.</p> Data That You Tell Us to Share <p>You can direct us to share your data with other parties—like when you link your Fitbit account with a third-party app, send status updates to your Facebook or Twitter account, or direct us to share data with your employer as part of a wellness program.
</p> See What's Sharable <i>
</i> Ways you can share your data <p>This fitness journey is yours.
That’s why Fitbit lets you share what you want, when you want, with whoever you want—whether you’re connecting with friends and family to get motivated, showing your health stats to a trainer, or using other apps to help you stay on track.</p> Making Your Profile Public <p>Sometimes you feel like sharing, sometimes you don’t.
Use the “Profile Viewed By” tool in your account settings to see what’s visible to others, then adjust your privacy settings to your liking.
</p> Posting in the Community <p>To post to Fitbit community message boards, you’ll be asked to create a community username, separate from your Fitbit profile name, which will be posted next to any comments you publish.</p> Entering Contests &amp.
Giveaways <p> Any data you submit in connection with Fitbit contests, giveaways and other promotions will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted.
</p> Using Social Tools <p>When you compete on the Leaderboard or in Challenges, or if you post comments to Fitbit community message boards, your data will be displayed based on your visibility settings.
Because you’re a boss and other people should know that about you.
</p> Taking a Survey <p> Fitbit may ask you to fill out surveys to help us understand your use of our products and services.
Any information you provide in connection with these surveys will only be used in relation to that survey.
