          <p><strong>International Data Transfers</strong></p>
          <p>Zoom operates globally, which means personal data may be transferred, stored (for example, in a data
            center), and
            processed outside of the country or region where it was initially collected where Zoom or its service
            providers have
            customers or facilities – including in countries where meeting participants or account owners hosting
            meetings or
            webinars that you participate in or receiving messages that you send are based.</p>
          <p>Therefore, by using Zoom Products or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you
            acknowledge
            that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States where we are established, as
            well as in
            other countries outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Such countries may have data protection rules
            that are
            different and less protective than those of your country.</p>
          <p>We protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement wherever it is processed and take
            appropriate
            contractual or other steps to protect it under applicable laws. Where personal data of users in the EEA,
            Switzerland,
            or the UK is being transferred to a recipient located in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK
            which has
            not been recognized as having an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that the transfer is governed
            by the
            European Commission’s standard contractual clauses. Please contact us if you would like further information
            in that
            respect. </p>

          <p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act</strong></p>
          <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California residents may have a right to: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> the categories and specific pieces of personal data Zoom has collected, the
              categories of
              sources from which the personal data is collected, the business purpose(s) for collecting the personal
              data, and the
              categories of third parties with whom Zoom has shared personal data; </li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong> personal data under certain circumstances; and</li>
            <li><strong>Opt out of the “sale”</strong> of personal data. We do not sell your personal data in the
              conventional
              sense. However, like many companies, we use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your
              interests
              based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies about your online activity. This is
              called
              interest-based advertising. The CCPA’s statutory definition of the term “sale” is broad and may include
              interest-based advertising. You can get more information and opt out of the use of cookies on our sites
              for
              interest-based advertising purposes by clicking the <a
                href="https://zoom.us/privacy#:~:text=Zoom%20uses%20customer%20content%20only,may%20choose%20to%20share%20information.">Do
                Not Sell My Personal Information</a> link, in the webpage footer, and setting your preferences. You will
              need to
              set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt out. This feature
              uses a
              cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to reset
              your
              settings. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Zoom will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights, which is further in line with
            your rights
            under the CCPA.</p>
          <p>To exercise your rights, contact us by emailing privacy@zoom.us or calling +1-888-799-9666. To opt out of
            the use of
            cookies on our sites for interest-based advertising purposes, follow the instructions above. </p>
          <p>We will acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days, and provide a substantive response
            within 45
            calendar days, or inform you of the reason and extension period (up to 90 days) in writing. </p>
          <p>Under the CCPA, only you or an authorized agent may make a request related to your personal data. Note that
            to
            respond to your requests to access or delete personal data under the CCPA, we must verify your identity. We
            may do so
            by requiring you to log into your Zoom account (if applicable), provide information relating to your account
            (which
            will be compared to information we have, such as profile information), give a declaration as to your
            identity under
            penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. You may designate an authorized agent to submit
            your
            verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of
            power of
            attorney. </p>
          <p><strong> </strong></p>
          <p><strong>California’s Shine the Light Law</strong></p>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine The Light” law, permits California residents to
            annually
            request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information (if any) to third parties for the
            third
            parties’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share Personal Information with
            third
            parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.</p>
