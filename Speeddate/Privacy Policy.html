<p>SpeedDate offers location-enabled services and may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID).
Your location may also be transmitted off of your mobile device even when an application is closed.
You agree to share your location with SpeedDate on a continuous and periodic basis.
While, we never share your exact location with another member, the location may be used to measure your proximity to other users and cause notifications to be sent to other users notifying them that you are nearby.
The messaging to other users with whom you are matched may include your approximate distance from them as well as your profile and photograph.
Other SpeedDate members may use or disclose your information to others without our control and without your knowledge.
We therefore urge you to think carefully about members with whom you choose to interact.</p>
<br>
<p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Service.
"Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive that assist Us in providing customized services.

This information may include the URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet Protocol address.

<br>

There may also be a number of services offered by external service providers that help You use the Service.
