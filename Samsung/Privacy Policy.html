Samsung is committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors, users and customers of all of Samsung Services.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit or submit information to a Samsung Service, how we may use that information, and if and how we disclose it to third parties.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information that you provide directly to third parties whose services or content you access via a Samsung Service.
You should check the applicable privacy policy of any third party service providers whose service or content you access.<br>

Separate from such consent, your use or participation in Samsung Service will be construed as your acceptance of the Privacy Policy and of our collection, use, disclosure, transfer, management and storage of your Personal Information as defined and described below.
We may, from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.
