		</header>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Thanks for sending us good vibes by using the various services available within Viber! You may be surprised, but we will refer to all such services, including additional apps published by Viber Media S.a.r.l, and also third party services which are powered by Viber&#8217;s technology, as the &#8220;Services&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Terms of Use (or, the &#8220;Terms&#8221;) presented below are the basic rights and obligations that you and us have between us when you use our Services. The language of the Terms will seem legal (basically, because they are) but we still tried to make them as simple as possible for you to read, so that we are sure that you knowingly choose to enjoy our Services under these binding Terms (which actually constitute a binding agreement between Viber Media S.a r.l. and yourself).</p>
<p>When you use our Services, in addition to enjoying a world of good vibes, you also agree to the Terms and they affect your rights and obligations. You can choose not to enjoy the Services, if you don&#8217;t want these Terms to apply (and by these Terms we also mean our <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/viber-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/cookies-and-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="/cookies-and-tracking">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy</a>, <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/dmca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="/dmca">DMCA Policy</a>, and other policies on our policies page, which are incorporated herein).</p>
<p>NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: Viber is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone and does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communication arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.</p>
<p>Some features of our Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you should read before making use of those features, and they add up to these Terms. You understand that, just like a regular mobile phone service, anyone with knowledge of your phone number may call you or send you messages through our Services and anyone you send a message to can use the content of your message as they desire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">1. <strong><span style="color: #655cac;">Legal Capacity; Children and Minors.</span></strong> If you are under the age of consent in your country to form a binding agreement, you should only use our Service if you are either an emancipated minor, or have the legal consent of your parent or guardian for your use of our Service. You should use our Service only if you are fully able to understand and enter into and comply with these Terms. Our Services are not intended for children under 13: if you are under 13, please wait until you turn 13 to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">2. <strong><span style="color: #655cac;">Updates to Terms.</span></strong> We are always working on adding additional features to our Services, and because of that, and also since sometimes applicable laws change, we may revise and reissue these Terms occasionally, by posting updated Terms. You consent and agree to receive notices of updates of these Terms through our posting of updated Terms on the Services. You should visit this page regularly to review the current Terms. If you do not agree to updated Terms, you should stop using our Services and/or close your account. Your continued use of any of our Services will be deemed as your acceptance of any revisions.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">8. <span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>Charges for Viber Out Service and Other Products or Features.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>8.1 Calling non-Viber phone numbers and premium rate numbers with Viber Credit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>8.1.1</strong></span> The rates for calling landlines and mobile phones outside of the Viber community consist of a per-minute rate as set out on <a href="http://account.viber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="http://account.viber.com/">http://account.viber.com/</a>. After a 4-hour call duration, the call will be disconnected and require a re-dial.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>8.1.2</strong></span> Viber may change the rates for calling phones at any time without notice to you by posting such change at <a href="http://account.viber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="http://account.viber.com/">http://account.viber.com/</a>. The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">8.1.3</span></strong> The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent. For example a total call at a price of €0.034 will be rounded to €0.03. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Viber Credit balance in your User Account.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">8.1.4</span></strong> The use of Viber Out is subject to our <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/viber-out-calls-fair-usage-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Usage Principles</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">8.2</span></strong> Subscriptions/Calling plans. Viber offers cost-saving calling plans specifying a fixed price for specified destinations and time periods. We also offer recurring calling plans which renew on a periodical basis and are a type of subscription. Our calling plans, including the unlimited plans, are intended for individual use only and are subject to our <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/viber-out-calls-fair-usage-principles/" target="_blank">Fair Usage Principles</a> to prevent fraud and misuse. They also exclude special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers. We may terminate your subscription and/or offer you an alternative calling plan if we notice that your usage is in breach of our Fair Usage Principals. We reserve the right to change our calling plans and subscriptions or stop offering them at any time. For Subscriptions which include a bundle of features, we will notify you in the event that the types of products in the Subscriptions change and you will have the right to terminate the subscription. Unused minutes or credit will not roll from one month to the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">8.3</span></strong> Sticker Subscriptions. In certain locations, Viber offers digital sticker subscriptions for a fixed price, allowing Users to download otherwise paid-for stickers for free during the subscription period. Our digital stickers are protected by copyright and are intended for Users’ individual use only.  The use of our digital stickers is subject to our <a href="https://www.viber.com/terms/viber-out-calls-fair-usage-principles/" target="_blank">Fair Usage Principles</a> to prevent fraud and misuse. We reserve the right to change our sticker subscriptions or stop offering them at any time.  We also may remove at any time any sticker packs included in a subscription. For Subscriptions which include a bundle of features (e.g., stickers and other services), we will notify you in the event that the types of products in the Subscriptions change and in that event you will have the right to terminate that subscription. We reserve the right to limit access to sticker packs downloaded through a subscription, following termination or expiry of the subscription. Our Payments Policy explains the terms relating to the way in which you pay us for Subscriptions, including whether such payment is to be made through your mobile phone bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">8.4</span></strong> The charges for other Viber products or features will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from Viber.

You can choose whether or not to accept the new charges prior to completing your next purchase of the applicable product. The new prices will apply to your next purchase after the new prices have been published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>8.5</strong></span> From time to time, Viber may offer products or features available at no charge for a trial period, at Viber&#8217;s sole discretion, including as to duration and scope of no charge offers. However, Viber reserves the right to charge you for such products (at the normal rate) in the event that Viber determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other device or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.</p>

The Viber Credit that you purchase will be applied to your User Account at the time of purchase. We will send you an acknowledgment of your order of Viber Credit [by email]. We use the services of third parties to process your payments and we require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">9.2</span></strong> If you do not use your Viber Credit for a period of six months (including Viber Credit that has been allocated to you by a Viber administrator), such credits will be frozen. You can reactivate the Viber Credit by accessing your Viber-Out account on <a href="http://viber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="http://viber.com">viber.com</a>, and following the instructions therein.

(ii) You remove Viber from your mobile device and do not reinstall it within three months (iii) You do not log in to Viber for twelve consecutive months.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;">For Japanese numbers (+81), Viber Credit expires <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1065071690"><span class="aQJ">within 180 days</span></span> of purchase, with no ability to reactivate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">9.4 Automatic Recurring Charge. </span></strong>The recurring charge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Viber Credit through the Viber website, unless you uncheck the appropriate checkbox at the time of purchase. Your Viber Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method you initially designated when you registered your account every time your Viber account balance goes below the threshold set by Viber from time to time. You can disable the recurring charge feature at any time by accessing your User Account. Any charges mentioned in specific currencies are solely considered as examples, and do not take currency fluctuations or discrepancies into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>9.5</strong></span> Payment for Subscriptions (e.g. recurring calling plans) are made on a recurring payment basis. This means that you agree that at the applicable recurring intervals your payment method will be charged, until you actively elect to terminate the Subscription.</p>

If we charged your credit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. Additional Terms may apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">10. Refunds.</span></strong></p>

If you purchase any digital content from Viber, any right you may have to withdraw from or cancel the purchase will terminate once the digital content has been delivered to you upon your request, and you will not be entitled to claim any refund, except where you believe Viber has charged you in error. If you use third party services to purchase Viber Out Credit, such purchase is also subject to the terms of such third party (including with respect to payment terms, refunds, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><span style="color: #655cac;">10.2</span></strong> Viber reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes or suspects (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same product or feature; (ii) that you are in breach of the terms of this License; (iii) that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently; or (iv) that you purchased your credit through a third party service and the terms of such third party do not allow such refund. This refund policy does not affect any of your statutory rights to pursue a claim.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">32. <span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief.</strong></span></p>
<p>This section sets forth the exclusive way you can resolve any dispute you may have with us. If you ever wish to seek any relief from us, you agree to do it only through arbitration, and you waive the ability to pursue class action.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>(a) U.S. Residents:</strong></span> To the fullest extent permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to Viber’s intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute of any kind between you and Viber arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York state or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 8(a) shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and we agree that we intend that this Section 8(a) satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to Viber. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, Viber shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. Viber agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #655cac;"><strong>(b) Non-U.S. Residents:</strong></span> If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Service or the Terms (a “Section 8(b) Dispute”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 8(b) Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 8(b).  Your notice to us must be sent to us at <a href="mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:Viberforeigndispute@viber.com">Viberforeigndispute@viber.com</a>. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Viber and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Viber to resolve the Section 8(b) Dispute on terms which either you or Viber, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-bottom: 0;">If your Section 8(b) dispute against Viber involves a paid Viber Service and we are unable to resolve it through dialogue (as described above), Viber will Directive 2013/11/EU on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution.
