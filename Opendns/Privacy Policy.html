DNS translates a domain name (e.g., http://www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.
When you use OpenDNS services, OpenDNS stores certain DNS, IP address and related information about you to improve the quality of our service, to provide you with OpenDNS services and for internal business and analysis purposes.</p> Cookies, Clear GIFs, Clickstream and Browser Information
