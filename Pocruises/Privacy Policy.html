P&amp;O Cruises is a trading name of Carnival plc.
Any personal information provided to P&amp;O Cruises is controlled by Carnival plc (we and us).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and store personal information about you and your use of this website.
What information do we collect and how do we use it? We will not collect any information about individuals, except where it is specifically and knowingly provided, for example, if you book a cruise, request brochures or other information from us or enter competitions or register for promotions.
We may also invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback.
All this data is referred to in this Privacy Policy as 'personal information'.
We collect personal information such as name, address, telephone number and email address.
If you book a cruise we will also collect your passport and credit or debit card details.
Other information that we collect may include medical, health, mobility and dietary requirements.
This allows us to process and fulfil your booking or other requests.
If you provide us with the personal information of any third parties, for example any other passengers included in a booking for a cruise, you must have the authority of those third parties to provide their personal information to us for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
If you book a cruise the personal information you provide to us will be used for the purposes set out in the Data Protection section of our Booking Conditions.
The personal information you provide to us or which we obtain through your dealings with us may also be used to review, develop and improve the cruises and other services we offer and for statistical analysis.
We, and other Carnival Corporation group companies (including those in the US), may use the information that we collect to contact you by post, email and/or telephone with information and offers from P&amp;O Cruises and other Carnival group cruise brands (such as Cunard, Princess Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Ocean Village, Holland America Line, Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa Cruises).
If you have booked and you would like to alter your marketing preferences you can now do so via the Cruise Personaliser system on the P&amp;O Cruises website.
Alternatively, you can write to us at Customer Data Department, P&amp;O Cruises, Carnival House, 100 Harbour Parade, Southampton, SO15 1ST.
If you wish to obtain a copy of the personal information held about you, please write to the above address.
We may make a charge for supplying this information as permitted by law.
Will P&amp;O Cruises share the information it receives? If you book a cruise we may pass your personal information on to other relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels and transport companies.
Your personal information may also be passed to travel agents, security and credit checking companies, credit and charge card companies, government and enforcement agencies and to the public authorities of any country in your itinerary, including customs and immigration authorities.
This may involve sending your personal information between different countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area where controls on data protection may not be as strong as the legal requirements in the United Kingdom.
Contractors: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples include fulfilling requests, processing payments, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data and providing marketing assistance.
Our contractors have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
We may share non-personal aggregate statistics about visitors to this site and traffic patterns with other parties.
