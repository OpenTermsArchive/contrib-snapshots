<p><strong>WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS</strong></p>
<p>This privacy policy covers data that the Trade Desk collects, uses and discloses from our owned and operated corporate websites, client-facing portals and by other means, including through your contact with us (“Websites”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information (“PII”) and how you can access and update this information.</p>
<p>This policy does not cover data that is collected, used or disclosed through the Trade Desk’s advertising technology platform and systems (the “Platform”). For more information on privacy as it relates to the Platform, please see <u><a href="/us/privacy">The Trade Desk Platform Privacy Policy</a></u>. Additionally, this policy does not apply to the privacy practices of other websites that are linked to from our Websites. The Trade Desk is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those websites to understand their data privacy practices.</p>
<p>The Trade Desk is a member of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (NAI) and adheres to the NAI’s 2020 Code of Conduct.

<p><strong>PII We Collect From Our Websites</strong></p>
<p>We may collect PII such as your name, email address and phone number when you interact with us in the manners described below.

<p>We may also collect your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area derived from your IP address or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.</p>
<p>Pseudonymous data may contain cookie data. To understand more about how cookies are used on our Websites, see the COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITES section below.</p>

<p>We may disclose your information to companies that provide data processing services to help us with our business activities, such as sending email communications on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>We will also disclose your information:</p>
<ul><li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,</li><li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li><li>If the Trade Desk is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, in such case you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Websites of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you have regarding your information, or</li><li>any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li></ul><p><strong>COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITES</strong></p>
<p>“Cookies” are data files that are stored on your browser or device and are used to remember user preferences and behaviors over time. Cookies allow us to recognize your device and remember information, such as your preferred language and other general settings.</p>
<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, the Trade Desk) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Our Websites use both first party and third-party cookies. For more information about specific cookies on this site, please see <a href="/us/cookie-notice">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>First Party Cookies</strong></p>
<p>First party cookies on our Websites are used for a variety of reasons, including purposes which may be strictly necessary for our Websites to function properly. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver our Websites, we do not seek consent for such uses.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Our Websites may contain content, pixels or cookie syncs from third parties, as outlined below. Note also that, in jurisdictions where consent is required for the placement of cookies, the appearance of any third parties on our Websites is subject to these consents being obtained by or on behalf of these third parties through, for example, the IAB’s Transparency and Consent Framework. We do not control these third parties, and you should refer to the privacy statements of our partners and service providers listed below to find out how they use cookies on our Websites and any data derived from such cookies.</p>
<p>Our Websites may contain content or pixels from service providers providing certain services on our behalf, as well as content, pixels or cookie syncs from other ad tech partners, including the Trade Desk and our pixels. These third parties may collect data about your web viewing behavior on our Websites and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include targeted advertising. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of targeted advertising. If you would like more information, please refer to the <strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong> section below.</p>
<p>You can remove or manage cookies by following directions provided in your browser or device’s “help” or “preferences” areas. Note: if you reject cookies, you may still use our Websites, but some functionalities and areas of our Websites may be limited. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information. You may also seek additional information <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Our third-party partners or service providers may employ other tracking technologies like clear gifs (sometimes called “web Beacons” or “tracking pixels”), that are pieces of code that can be embedded on websites and can be used to learn how you interact with that website. Clear gifs help us better manage content on our Websites by informing us what content is effective. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Our Websites may include social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button. These features may allow the social media provider, like Facebook, to collect certain information, such as your IP address, cookies and page you are visiting. We may also communicate information to you about our products and services using social media platforms. Your interactions with social media, these features and data collection enabled by such social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media provider offering them. Please note that links to social media platforms or content from our Website does not mean that we endorse the linked social media platform and/or content.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>The Trade Desk operates its Websites from servers located in the United States. Laws governing the collection and use of data in the United States may not be equivalent to those in the country where you reside.</p>
<p>We transfer data from the EU or Switzerland to the US under <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNT1AAO&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a valid legal framework</a>. If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and such mechanism, the terms of the transfer mechanism shall govern.</p>
<p>We commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data and are subject to enforcement by the US Federal Trade Commission. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy policy should first contact us at <strong>privacy</strong> ((at)) <strong>thetradedesk</strong> ((dot)) <strong>com</strong> or at the address listed in the “Contact Us” section of this policy. If you have unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S. based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a> on Privacy Shield: On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement declaring Privacy Shield invalid. We now rely on other transfer mechanisms for the cross-border transfer of data. However, The Trade Desk continues to live up to its obligations under the program. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Please <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a> for more information or to submit a complaint.</p>

<p>We retain the pseudonymous data collected on our Websites for up to 18 months. After 18 months (or sooner) the data is de-identified or aggregated and stored for up to 3 additional years.</p>
<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable security measures, including physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, to prevent the unauthorized access to, loss, misuse, or alteration of the information collected through our Websites. We believe these measures are appropriate given the nature of our data and our systems, but we make no assurances in this policy about our ability to prevent any such event or the possible harm to you or any third party that could arise from it.</p>
