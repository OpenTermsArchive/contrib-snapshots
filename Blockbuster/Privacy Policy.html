How Do I Contact Blockbuster Regarding The Web Site And This Privacy Policy?  What is Personal Information? Blockbuster defines personal information as information about an individual that enables someone to identify or contact a person and includes, among other things, a person's full name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as other information we maintain about a person in identifiable form in combination with one of the foregoing identifiers, such as account history, financial information, titles rented or purchased or categories of products rented or purchased.
Categories of personal information that we collect include, for example: Basic identifying information such as e-mail address and first and last names Security information such as password, secret question and answer or driver's license Contact information such as address and phone number Store membership information such as membership number, names of others allowed to use your account and favorite stores Billing information such as credit or check card, expiration date, billing address and account history Site preferences such as movie categories you like, game platforms you have and whether you wish for cover art to be displayed Ratings and reviews of movies and games Lists of movies and games, such as for online subscription, rental or purchase E-newsletter selections and preferences Direct marketing contact preferences Rental and purchase history Sweepstakes entries Complaints, questions and information submitted to customer service agents or similar individuals either in person, by phone, by e-mail or by entry on a Site Site behavior such as pages visited or searches requested Browser information such as browser version, connection speed, IP address and the presence of various related plug-ins and tools such as media players  When Does Blockbuster Collect Personal Information? Blockbuster collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to Blockbuster, for example: when you apply for a customer membership in our stores; register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list.
After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, Blockbuster collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site.
This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior.
Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User.
This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.
We may also collect personal information from other sources.
For example, we purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing databases of User and Member information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our Users and Members would be interested in.
We use this information to enhance or overlay the 'profile' of individual Users.
This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the User's or Member's personally identifiable information.
 What Happens When I Register On The Web Site? In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process.
During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password.
Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature.
For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address to which products will be mailed and financial information in the form of a credit card or check card number and expiration date for billing purposes.
Users signing up for our e-newsletter service may enter the types of movies or games in which they are interested and about which they wish to receive information in the newsletter.
 What Happens When I Place An Order On The Web Site? Certain features of the Web Site do not require registration but may still require personal information to be entered, such as placing an order for a product.
We request information from the User during the ordering process.
For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card or check card number, expiration date).
This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.
 Does Blockbuster Use Cookie Technology? Blockbuster uses cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our internal business purposes.
A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
For example, Blockbuster uses cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site.
Blockbuster also uses cookies to help track referrals from third party web sites.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it.

A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.
You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
Blockbuster and its third party vendors use web beacons to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users in order to improve the Web Site's quality and to support our business.

We and our business partners use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track User's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc.
are not linked to personally identifiable information.
