Security Statement We have made every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the use of a secure server.
With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the card must be the one who places the order.
The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption for securing communications and transactions across the Internet.
The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications “pip” between the purchaser and our web entity.
Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering.
A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window identifies the security mode of a browser.
When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open.
Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is in “secure” mode.
SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption.
In addition, it is our policy not to send your credit card number via email.
In fact, this is a practice we recommend you adopt in all of your internet activities.
While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
This Privacy &amp; Security Policy supersedes all prior policies and is effective February 23, 2011.
