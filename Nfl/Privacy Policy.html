This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.</p>
<p>
<b>8.

</p>
<p>We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) and geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Children's Privacy</b>
</p>
<p>The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.
If we are made aware we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years old in a manner that is inconsistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), we will delete this information as soon as possible.</p>

<b>12.
Your California Privacy Rights</b>
</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please send an email to CAPrivacyRights@nfl.com or write us at CA Privacy Rights, NFL Digital Media Group, 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154.</p>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.</p>
<p>
<b>13.
