    aware that each dealer operates as a separate legal entity and you should read the dealer’s privacy statement to

    encourages its dealers to ensure full compliance with all applicable privacy legislation and has provided
    information to our dealers relating to privacy obligations, GM is not responsible for dealers’ compliance with
    applicable law.<br>

<p>We maintain reasonable and adequate technical, administrative, and physical security and confidentiality measures

    your information also undertake to provide such security and confidentiality measures in accordance with industry
    standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="RETENTION"><b><u>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION&nbsp;</u></b></p>
<p>We may keep the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide products or services to you, to operate
    our business, to enable us to communicate with you, for our safety, research, evaluation of use, or troubleshooting
    purposes, or to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations.&nbsp; Where required, we will anonymize or dispose of

<p><b><u>Your Rights and Choices</u></b></p>
<p>The CCPA provides certain consumers (i.e., California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes the CCPA rights that you may have and explains how to exercise those rights. You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising these privacy rights.</p>
<p><i>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information</i></p>
<p>We have disclosed or sold Personal Information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months in the following categories: Identifiers and internet or similar network activity.&nbsp; You have a right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information.&nbsp; We do not sell the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>
<p><i>Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Used, Disclosed, or Sold</i></p>
<p>You have the right to request up to twice in a 12-month period that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you the information you request in the following areas: (1) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (2) the categories of sources for the Personal Information; (3) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Personal Information; and (5) the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you in the preceding 12 months.</p>
<p><i>Right to Delete Personal Information Collected or Maintained</i></p>

<p><i>Verifying Your Request</i></p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request to know or request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
