 Your Rights and Choices</u></b></p>
<p>The CCPA provides certain consumers (i.e., California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes the CCPA rights that you may have and explains how to exercise those rights. You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising these privacy rights.</p>
<p><i>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information</i></p>
<p>We have disclosed or sold Personal Information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months in the following categories: Identifiers and internet or similar network activity.&nbsp; You have a right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information.&nbsp; We do not sell the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Used, Disclosed, or Sold</i></p>
<p>You have the right to request up to twice in a 12-month period that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you the information you request in the following areas: (1) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (2) the categories of sources for the Personal Information; (3) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Personal Information; and (5) the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you in the preceding 12 months.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Right to Delete Personal Information Collected or Maintained</i></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your request and verify your identity, we will delete your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception under the CCPA applies.&nbsp; In our response to your request to delete, we will specify the manner in which we have deleted your Personal Information or, if we must deny your deletion request, the basis for this refusal.</p>
<p><i>Exercising Your Rights</i></p>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>

<p><i>Authorizing an Agent</i></p>
<p>You may designate an authorized agent to submit your consumer request on your behalf, so long as the authorized agent has your written permission to do so and you have taken steps to verify your identity directly with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Verifying Your Request</i></p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request to know or request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.&nbsp; To verify your identity, we ask that you to provide us with the following information when you submit your request:&nbsp; (1) first name, (2) last name, and (3) phone number or email.</p>
<p>We will use the above information to verify your identity.&nbsp; We will require additional information to verify your identity and fulfill your request depending on the type of request or the information requested by you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</u><i><u></u></i></p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make material changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our website homepage.</p>
