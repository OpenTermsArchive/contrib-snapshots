Unless we state otherwise, any new features or functionality provided by Patch on the Sites and/or Apps are also part of the Service.
By accessing or using the Service, whether through a personal computer, mobile device or any other means, or submitting any content or information for publication or distribution, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

</p>
<p> Just like your local community, Patch and the Service are growing and changing every day, and thus this Privacy Policy is subject to change by Patch at any time.
The most current version of this Privacy Policy can always be viewed on the Sites, and we will always let you know when the latest update occurred – just check the “Effective Date” on the Privacy Policy posted on the Sites.
If you keep using the Service or submit any content after the latest Effective Date, we assume that you have accepted the new Privacy Policy.

</p>  
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
<p>Patch and its Partners may use browser cookies, Flash cookies, or locally shared objects (“LSOs”) that operate similarly to browser cookies, “web beacons,” clear GIFs, advertising identifiers, tags, scripts and similar technologies (“cookies”) in connection with your use of the Service or third party websites, mobile applications or platforms.
Such “cookies” may include unique identifiers, and may be placed on your computer’s browser or your device, on web pages, in an email or in other locations.
Patch and its Partners may use “cookies” to recognize your device.
store your preferences.
track and collect information about user behavior, for example by counting the number of visitors to a web page, tracking open rates, clicks and forwards.
prevent fraud.
comply with legal requirements.
and facilitate and enhance communication and interaction with the Service or with other websites or services.
Cookies may be persistent or may be stored for a single session.</p>
<p>Patch, or its Partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to customize your visit to or use of the Service, or to help enhance or improve the Service, for example by storing your password or delivering relevant advertising to you when you use the Service.
We may also work with our Partners to use such technologies to help them provide advertisements to you when you visit other websites or applications, and to research and analyze how the Service is used and user response to and interaction with advertisements.</p>
<p>Patch may work with our Partners to synchronize unique, non-personally identifiable identifiers in order to match our identifiers with those used by our Partners.
These companies may collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to or use of the Service and other websites and apps.
The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by such Partners and advertisers is not in Patch’s control and is subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service, you consent to such use of cookies and other technologies, and similar technologies that may be developed in the future, by Patch and its Partners.
You may be able to set your browser to disable cookies or LSOs, or to refuse certain types of cookies or warn you before accepting cookies.
LSOs using Adobe Flash can be managed using Flash management tools on the Adobe website.
However, doing so may mean that certain parts of the Service may not work for you.
Further, “opting out” does not prevent the display of all advertising.
Some Partners may use technologies other than cookies to recognize your computer or device or to collect information about your use of the Service or other websites or services, and you may not be able to block use of such technologies.
While some browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to websites and online services, Patch does not currently take any action or respond to such signals.</p>
<p>Patch or its Partners may use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect information, such as your IDFA or Android Advertising ID, and other information about how your device interacts with the Service.
SDKs allow app developers to enable advertising, collection of data and related services and analytics in apps.
Patch may use this technology to deliver, or to help Partners deliver, advertising through the Apps and other mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your device.
Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your device’s advertising identifier by accessing the privacy settings.
</p> Third Parties
<p>Patch Partners may use cookies, widgets, SDKs, IP addresses and similar technologies when you access or use the Service or see advertisements provided through the Service for purposes such as providing you with advertising that is relevant to you, analytics purposes (for example to determine whether you later purchased a product or service in an advertisement you clicked on or took some other action), providing content from a content provider’s server, and offering content or services based on the content of the pages you visit or other criteria.
In some cases, because you must request content from the Partner’s server or otherwise communicate directly with the Partner’s server the Partner can collect your information, such as your IP address or browser information, as if you had visited their website or used their app directly.
In connection with the foregoing, Patch Partners may collect information about the content or ads you viewed, how long you spent on different pages or parts of the Service, how you arrived at specific pages on the Service, and how you responded to ads that you saw.
Partners may also collect information about other apps on your devices, the websites you visit, your location and other information.
Patch may also allow certain Partners, such as third-party ad servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and providers of sponsored content to serve advertisements and collect information within the Service.

</p> California Residents
<p>California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has opted-out of such information-sharing.

</p> Annex 1 European Data Privacy Laws <p>If you are a European Resident, you have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information under the applicable European data privacy laws under the General Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable data protection laws which may be amended from time to time (“European Data Privacy Laws”).
This section only applies to such users.
Under applicable European Data Privacy Laws, Patch is the data controller.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information when you access our website, public registers, social media, publicly accessible websites, or if you access or use the Service on a mobile device.
Please see the main Privacy Policy for further information on “Personal Information We Collect”.</p> Rights to Control Personal information
<p>Under the applicable European Data Privacy Laws, you have the right to ensure your Personal Information is accurate.
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Information.
You also have the right to request that we delete or restrict the processing of your Personal Information, although we are permitted to retain it where we still have an ongoing purpose to retain it or as otherwise permitted under the European Data Privacy Laws.
This may compromise our ability to provide you with our Services.
You also have the right to transfer your Personal Information to another service provider subject to the European Data Privacy Laws.

To make any of these requests or to opt out of receiving marketing communications, please contact us at support@patch.com.</p> International Transfers
<p>If you are a European Resident, you will be visiting Patch from a location outside of the United States and therefore you will be connected through and to servers located within the United States (where data privacy laws are less stringent than the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and some other jurisdictions).
Some of the recipients processing your Personal Information may be located in countries (including the United States) that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to that set forth by the EEA and some other jurisdictions.
Patch will take appropriate steps to ensure that such recipients act in accordance with the European Data Privacy Laws.</p> Sharing your Personal information
<p>We share your Personal Information with SourcePoint Technologies, Inc., a service provider for our website platform and associated technology.

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<p>Under applicable European Data Privacy Laws, children between the age of 13 to 16 may provide valid consent to process their Personal Information.
Where consent is required under such European Data Privacy Laws, you have an obligation to provide to us evidence of such consent or, as required under the European Data Privacy Laws, the authorization of the holder of parental responsibility for the child.
We may refuse to process, or continue to process, the child’s Personal Information until we receive this evidence of consent or authorization.
If we become aware that Personal Information has been collected from a child under age 13 (or such higher age as required by applicable law), we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.</p> Retention of Personal information
<p>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.</p> Data security
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p> Complaint Process
<p>If you have any concerns regarding how we are handling your Personal Information, please contact us.
