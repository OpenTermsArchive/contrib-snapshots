g.
UPS, APX, USPS, FedEx, Paymentech, Product Manufacturers) strictly to process and ship your order.
Promotional Offers At times we may present or send offers to select eBags subscribers on behalf of other parties.
When we do this, we do not give that company your personally identifiable information without your consent.
If you do not want to receive such communications, please edit your account preferences.
Agents We employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services.
Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents").
They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than improving eBags' services and offerings.

We only share with these pre-screened companies the individual names and postal address of customers who have actually purchased products from us.
If you do not want us to share your name and postal address information, simply follow the instructions in the section below titled "Accessing and Updating Your Information.
" We may also receive information about you from other sources (such as demographic information and purchase history) and add it to our information in order to make our marketing efforts more efficient.

These third parties may serve other cookies.
Our advertising partners use the anonymous, non-personally identifying information they collect from our site, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers.
In the event that our advertisers collect any personal information on our behalf, it will not be used by them or disclosed to any third parties.
