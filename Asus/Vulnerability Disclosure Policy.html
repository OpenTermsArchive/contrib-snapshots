We strongly encourage you to periodically audit both your equipment and your security procedures, as this will ensure that you will be better protected against unwanted intrusion.
As a user of an ASUS router, we advise taking the following actions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Update your router to the latest firmware.
We strongly recommend that you do so as soon as new firmware is released.
You will find the latest firmware available for download from the ASUS support page at https://www.asus.com/support/ or the appropriate product page at https://www.asus.com/Networking/.
ASUS has provided a link to new firmware for selected routers at the end of this notice.</li>
<li>Set up separate passwords for your wireless network and router-administration page.
Use passwords with a length of at least eight characters, including a mix of capital letters, numbers and symbols.
Do not use the same password for multiple devices or services.</li>
<li>Enable ASUS AiProtection, if your router supports this feature.
Instructions on how to do this can be found in your router’s manual, or on the relevant ASUS support page, at https://www.asus.com/Networking/.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Please note that if you choose not to install this new firmware version then, to avoid any potential unwanted intrusion, we strongly recommend that you disable remote access from WAN or AiCloud, and reset your router to its default settings.
<br>
<br>
If you have already installed the latest firmware version, please disregard this notice.
<br>
<br>
Should you have any question or concerns, please contact ASUS via our Security Advisory reporting system: https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/

RT-N10 (EOL)<br>
RT-N10E (EOL)<br>
RT-N10U (EOL)<br>
RT-N56U (EOL)<br>
RT-N66U<br>
<br>
To help owners of these routers take necessary precautions, we compiled a security checklist:<br>
(1) Reset the device to factory default: Hold the Reset button in the rear for at least five seconds until the power LED starts blinking.<br>
(2) Update all devices to the latest firmware.<br>
(3) Ensure default admin password had been changed to a more secure one.
<br>
(4) Disable Remote Management (disabled by default, can only be enabled via Advanced Settings).<br>
(5) Enable the URL filter in the Advanced Settings -&gt.

Set the Filter table type as Black List.
Add the "photobucket" and "toknowall" in the URL filter list.
<br>
<br>
For any users with the EOL models listed above, we strongly advise upgrading to a router with AiProtection.
A wide selection of ASUS and ROG routers offer AiProtection powered by Trend Micro™.
Anytime a threat is detected, the connection between your device and the malicious server is blocked before any personal data is compromised.
The list of malicious servers is constantly updated by syncing with the Trend Micro cloud database automatically, to ensure your network environment is secure around the clock.

ASUS is working closely with chipset suppliers to resolve the vulnerability in the WPA2 security protocol, which affects some but not all ASUS products (check the list below).
KRACK can exploit the vulnerability only under certain conditions highlighted in the previous update.
Your network configuration is more secure when under these conditions:<br>
<br>
(1) Routers and gateways working in their default mode (Router Mode) and AP Mode.<br>
(2) Range extenders working in AP Mode.
<br>
(3) When Powerline adapters and switch products are used.
<br>
<br>
ASUS is working actively towards a solution, and will continue to post software updates.

</p> 10/18/2017 <strong>Security advisory for the vulnerabilities of WPA2 protocol</strong> ∇ <p>
ASUS is aware of the recent WPA2 vulnerability issue.
We take your security and privacy seriously and are currently working towards a full solution as quickly as possible.
In the meantime, we want to help clarify the severity of the potential threat, and let our valued customers know the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid or lessen the threat of being compromised.
<br>
<br>
Your devices are only vulnerable if an attacker is in physical proximity to your wireless network and is able to gain access to it.
This exploit cannot steal your banking information, passwords, or other data on a secured connection that utilizes proper end-to-end encryption.
However, an attacker could capture and read this information on an unsecured connection via an exploited WiFi network.
Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible for the attacker to redirect network traffic, send invalid data to devices or even inject malware into the network.
<br>
<br>
We are feverishly working with chipset suppliers to resolve this vulnerability and will release patched firmware for affected routers in the near future.
Before this patched firmware is released, here are a few cautions all users should take:
<br>
<br>
(1) Avoid public Wi-Fi and Hotspots until the routers and your devices are updated.
Use cellular network connections if possible.
<br>
(2) Only connect to secured services that you trust or have been verified.
Web pages that use HTTPS or another secure connection will include HTTPS in the URL.
If the connection is secured using TLS 1.2 your activities with that service is safe for now.
<br>
(3) Keep your operating system and antivirus software up-to-date.
Microsoft recently updated Windows to fix this exploit on their latest operating systems.
Google and Apple are following suit shortly.
<br>
(4) When in doubt, be safe and use your cellular network or a wired connection (Ethernet) to access the internet.
This exploit only affects 802.11 traffic between a Wi-Fi router and a connected device on an exploited WiFi connection.
