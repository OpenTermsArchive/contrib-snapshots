 Community Guidelines
<p>We want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels respected.
It’s up to all of us to make that happen.
This page includes important information about our expectations of you while using SoundCloud.
Please take the time to carefully read through this information.
we take these guidelines seriously and expect you to do the same.</p>
Copyright
<p>We have always set out to build a diverse, collaborative community of creators, where everyone gets credit for the content that they make and own, and where the rights of creators are respected.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all activity associated with your account, including all content that you post.
If you post content that belongs to someone else (for example, if you are a distributor or promotional agency acting on behalf of an artist or label), or if you use someone else’s content in a remix or other similar work, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the permission of all relevant rightsholders in order to post that content to SoundCloud.
Anyone uploading another person’s content without the necessary permissions is liable to have that content removed or their account terminated.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you can upload something, read our copyright information pages.
If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, tell us about it.</p>
Respect
<p>SoundCloud is an open, social platform, made up of a vibrant group of people with differing views, opinions, and cultural backgrounds.
We support freedom of speech and the fundamental right for individuals to express themselves, and expect everyone else to do the same.
Respecting each other on SoundCloud means following some basic principles:</p>
<p>
<strong>Don’t be a bully:</strong>
We have zero tolerance for abusive or threatening behavior within the community.
We consider abuse to be any activity where the intent is to attack or demean someone else.
Anyone found to be engaging in this type of activity risks the immediate, permanent termination of their account.</p>
<p>
<strong>Criticize constructively:</strong>
We recognize that criticism can be a valuable tool for helping each other to improve.
Remember that behind each track is a person.
Criticism should always focus on the content, and not on the individual who created it.
Please share your opinion with others, but do so in a constructive way.
Before posting feedback, always ask yourself whether you would appreciate receiving the same feedback.
If not, don’t post it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy of others:</strong>
Everyone has the right to privacy, no matter who they are.
Don’t share personal details of another person (or entity), without their permission.
This includes recordings of private conversations, photographs, unlisted phone numbers, and home or email addresses.</p>
Don’t pretend to be someone else
<p>As a platform built with creator needs in mind, we welcome the use of stage names or professional identities on SoundCloud.
However, that doesn’t mean that you can impersonate another person, or post content that is intentionally misleading.
As a rough guide, you mustn’t create profiles or post content that is intended to make people think you are someone else.
You must not use someone else’s name or trademark without their permission, or pretend to be associated with someone you aren’t, even if you feel that you are helping that person by doing so.</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is impersonating you, or is infringing your trademark rights, tell us about it.</p>
Self promotion &amp.
building your audience
<p>SoundCloud aims to help creators to connect directly with their fans.
We understand that promoting your work is important, and we encourage you to seek out fans and other like-minded individuals.
In our experience, the most successful forms of promotion are built upon meaningful interactions between creators and their audience.
However, there is a fine line between developing these connections and over-sharing with members of the community.</p>
<p>To help encourage a two-way relationship between creators and fans, we have technical restrictions in place to limit activity that goes against this principle.</p>
<p>Specifically, it’s not possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post identical or almost identical comments or messages in large volumes</li>
<li>Repeatedly follow large volumes of accounts in a short period of time</li>
<li>Repeatedly contribute your tracks to large volumes of groups in a short period of time</li>
<li>Repeatedly unfollow and refollow the same accounts, in order to draw attention to your own profile</li>
<li>Repeatedly repost or like tracks that you have reposted or liked in the past</li>
</ul>Forbidden content
<p>As an open platform, freedom of expression is important to us.
However, there are certain types of content that have no place on SoundCloud.
In order to protect the community and maintain positivity, please don’t post:</p>
<p>
<strong>Pornography:</strong>
Remember that SoundCloud can be accessed by people as young as 13.
Don’t post any content that is predominantly sexual in nature, or that could be perceived as an aid to sexual gratification.
This includes, but is not limited to, images containing nudity and recordings or detailed descriptions of sexual acts.
There are plenty of other places to find that content online.</p>
<p>
<strong>Hate speech:</strong>
You are welcome to share your opinions and beliefs on SoundCloud, even if they might be controversial, or challenge the status-quo.
However, we will not tolerate content that promotes or encourages hatred, discrimination or violence against others based on things like race, cultural identity or ethnic background, religious beliefs, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</p>
Spam &amp.
prohibited services
<p>We aim for SoundCloud to be a spam-free zone.
To support this effort, we have policies in place that prohibit both spammy activity and the use of related services which violate our Terms.</p>
<p>The following activity is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting unsolicited links to commercial spam i.e.
profiles or content whose sole aim is to drive traffic to external websites, via messages, comments, profile and track descriptions or artwork</li>
<li>Creating multiple accounts with the intention of inflating the popularity of other profiles</li>
<li>The creation, use, or promotion of:<ul>
<li>Bots or other automated means to perform social interactions;</li>
<li>Services that claim to boost a profile’s popularity such as followers, plays, likes, or reposts;</li>
<li>Services that sell social interactions or other forms of promotion on SoundCloud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>Tell us about it
<p>It’s possible that you might come across content that you disagree with or find distasteful from time to time.
If that’s the case, the best thing you can do is to ignore that content, and to block those who share it to avoid it in the future.
However, if you encounter any content that crosses the line and breaches these guidelines or our Terms of Use – including impersonation, abusive or threatening behaviour, pornography or malicious speech – tell us about it.
We have a dedicated team of people who will review all reports objectively, and remove any content that violates these rules, or applicable law.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that something that you find unacceptable, may not be unacceptable to everyone.
We try to maintain a fair and balanced approach, but reporting content will not always result in that content being removed if it does not break the rules.</p>
If you break the rules
<p>If we receive notification from a rightsholder that content uploaded to your account infringes their copyright, or if we believe that your activity violates any of our other guidelines, we will send you a written warning.
If we have to send you more than two of these warnings, we will terminate your account.
In the most extreme cases, we reserve the right to terminate your account immediately, without prior warning.</p>
To sum up
<p>Be considerate of others, respect the law and think about these guidelines before you post.
We aim to make objective, fair decisions when content is reported to us and in most cases, will send you a warning before we take any other measures.
We think this is reasonable but if you don't agree, maybe SoundCloud isn’t the place for you.</p>
<p>We may need to update these Community Guidelines occasionally, so please be sure to check back here every so often for updates.</p>
<p>The SoundCloud Team</p>
