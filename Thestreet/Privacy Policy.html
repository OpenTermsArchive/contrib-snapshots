<strong>How We May Collect Other Information </strong>
</p>
<p> We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Through your browser or device</strong>:  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly. </li>
<li>
<strong>Through your use of the App</strong>:  When you download and use the App, we may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers, the pages you use and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</li>
<li>
<strong>Using cookies</strong>:  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your computer.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions about them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on certain of the Services.  We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements.  At this time, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.    </li>
<li> If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given choices on how to manage them.  You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.</li>

<strong>similar technologies</strong>:  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about use of the Services and response rates. </li>

<li>
<strong>IP Address</strong>:  Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Services, along with the time of the visit and the pages visited.  Collecting IP addresses is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</li>
<li>
<strong>Physical Location:</strong>  We and our service providers may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals.  We and our service providers may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services, content, notice of events, and advertisements.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such collection or use of your device’s location, but, if you do, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.   </li>
<li>
<strong>From you</strong>:  We collect your preferred means of communication, your gender, your investment and other preferences, and other information when you voluntarily provide it. </li>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information </strong>
</p>
<p> We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
