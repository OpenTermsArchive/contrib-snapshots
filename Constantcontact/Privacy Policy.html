We may obtain information that is provided during any voluntary or mandatory registration process, online payment transaction, request for technical support, when you call or email us, or when you visit our Sites.
We collect information only as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this privacy statement.
</p>
<p>
Our Sites offer several opportunities for visitors to register for promotional and informational mailings, online webinars and resources, and to evaluate our products and services.
These registration forms enable users to opt-in to our mailing lists and require users to give contact information (such as name and email address).
Notice is given at the point of collection to enable users to choose whether or not they consent to the usage terms.
Those who have signed up for future mailings and subsequently wish to withdraw their participation may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the "Choice/Opt-out" section below).
We may use this information to provide you with requested information or products or services, to tailor the presentation of the Sites or products or services to you, to facilitate your movement through the Sites or your use of our products and services, to improve our products and services and do a better job of marketing them, or to communicate with you.
</p>
<p>
Our Sites also offer opportunities for visitors to purchase our products and services.
Payment information, including credit card data, is used only for the purpose of facilitating payment for the transaction with respect to which the information was provided.
</p>

You acknowledge and expressly agree that we may obtain additional information about you that we collect from other sources, such as information you provide at seminars or to our partners, information that is publicly available or that you consent to us receiving from third parties.
With your consent, we may access certain information from a third party social networking site ("SNS").
The information you allow us to access varies by SNS, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS.
When you consent to the SNS sharing information with us, the SNS may know that you have a relationship with us.
You can control and find out more about these privacy settings at the applicable SNS.
We may use this information to provide you with our products and services, to improve our products and services and do a better job of marketing them, or to communicate with you.
</p>
<p>
We also keep track of activity on our Sites using log files stored on our web servers.
We collect information, such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view.
We also keep track of how you got to our Sites and any links you click on to leave our Sites.
We may gather information about any device or other method of communication you use to interact with the Sites.
We also gather aggregated tracking information regarding overall usage of the Sites and the products and services, including tallies of page views and click-through activity and the number of messages sent using our products or services.
We may use this information to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, to assist you with technical support, to diagnose problems with our server, in connection with our security program, to administer our website, to improve our products and services and do a better job of marketing them, or to tailor our product and service offerings to you.
</p>

Security and Privacy
<p>
We employ reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.
We use industry-recognized technical safeguards, such as firewalls, and have adopted and implemented security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.
When we collect financial account information, such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Notwithstanding our efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute or unqualified protection of this information given the open nature and resulting instability of the Internet and World Wide Web, and we make no representations or warranties as to the effectiveness of our security and assume no liability for security breaches or any failure in the security of your computer equipment, your internet service provider or other networks and communications providers.

Sharing of Information
<p>
We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their use without your consent.
</p>
<p>
If you accessed one of our Sites or any of our products or services through or in connection with a solicitation from one of our partners, we may share your information with the partner and the partner may share related information with us.
Occasionally, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service).
Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which they were engaged, including for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
We may also share non-personally identifying information in the aggregate with third parties, such as the media, industry observers, potential customers or partners.
For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our Sites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.
</p>
<p>
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or other similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
We will notify you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transaction and the choices you may have regarding your information.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, we may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement authorities and/or other relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, when such disclosure is necessary or advisable, in our sole discretion, to conduct an investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or court order, bring legal action or pursue other relief when you or a third party are or may be: (a) violating our terms and conditions of use.
(b) causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating our property or other legal rights, or those of other users or third parties.

Cookies and Web Beacons
<p>
We use a variety of technologies on our Sites.
Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer so that the website can remember your browser in the future.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number.
When you visit our Sites, open our email, encounter our services online (including on one of our customer's websites), or click on one of our banner ads or videos, we or an authorized third party may send you a cookie.
</p>
<p>
Cookies may be used by us in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our Sites, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign, and to provide you with more relevant content.
Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, as well as enable us to make your visit to our website easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a customized experience.
</p>
<p>
Information gathered through usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal identifying information, unless you become a trial or paying customer of ours.
Once you submit personally identifiable information on our Sites (for example, by signing up to be a trial or paying customer of ours or by signing up for a seminar or white paper), we may link such information with cookies or other identifiers that are associated with your visit(s) to our Sites.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.
If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our Sites.
however, you may have limited access to some areas within our Sites or a different experience.
For more information on how to manage cookies in your web browser, see http://www.aboutcookies.org.
We also provide you with an option to opt-out of receiving certain cookies associated with our online advertising (see the "Online Advertising" section below).
</p>
<p>
Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images provided by us or authorized third parties known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images.
These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our Sites, seen our ads, or opened our email, and to track whether messages are shared using our social share features and, once shared, whether these messages are opened by the recipient.
In addition, when you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.
Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.
Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by email.
If you do not wish to receive web beacons by email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.
</p>
<p>
We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze information about your activity on our Sites, including data gathered by cookies or web beacons.
For example, we use Adobe® SiteCatalyst® and Adobe® Test&amp;Target® to improve our web site performance, to run tests on the effectiveness of our Sites and marketing efforts and to improve user experience.
For more information on the SiteCatalyst service and privacy policy, see http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/visualsciences/policy, and for more information on the Test&amp;Target service and privacy policy, see http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product.
All such data is only used for the purposes described in this section.
</p>
<p>
We may share non-personally identifying information with third parties, such as the media, industry observers or potential customers or partners.
</p>
<p>Back to Top</p>
Online Advertising
<p>
We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.
These GIF files are provided by our ad management partners and enable our partners to recognize a unique ad impression cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites.
With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
We give all Internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving our ad impression cookie.
If you opt out, your web browser will be associated with a generic "opt-out" cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personally identifying information with your browser.
Our "opt-out" cookie has no expiration date.
Keep in mind that participating in our opt-out program does not prevent you from seeing our online ads.
instead, information about the online ads we serve to you will not be recorded.
If you wish to opt-out of receiving this cookie, see http://www.constantcontact.com/opt-out-info.jsp.
</p>
<p>
Our ad management partners include Mediaplex, Google Inc., Advertising.com, LinkedIn Corporation, ShareThis and Facebook.
