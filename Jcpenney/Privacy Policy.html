<strong>technology used to serve advertising</strong>: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (e.g.

We also allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our site and to use that information to serve ads for JCPenney products or services, or the products or services of other companies when you visit our site or other sites.
