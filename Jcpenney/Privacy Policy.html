<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>information from third-party sources</strong>- We may receive information about you from third-parties.
For example, if you have a JCPenney Credit Card, we receive application and account information from the credit card issuing bank.
We also obtain data from third parties to improve the accuracy of and add to what we know about our customers.
This may improve the relevance of the offers or product recommendations we provide you or enhance our ability to contact you.
For example, we may work with other websites and services to present advertising to groups of our customers when they visit those sites.
Non-personal data received by us from this process is used to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>publicly available information</strong>–  We may collect information about you that is publicly available.
For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g.
a blog, chat room or social network) can be read, collected or used by us or others, and could be used to personalize your experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>using the information we collect</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>We use the information we collect to offer, improve, and provide our products and services, and to carry out various business functions.
We may combine, or use the services of third party companies to combine information about you that we collect online, in our stores, through mobile applications, and from third-party and public sources.  Examples of how that information is used include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• to communicate with you about and complete purchase, return or exchange transactions;</p>
<p>• to provide or communicate with you about products or services;</p>
<p>• for marketing and promotional purposes, including direct mail, coupons, emails, mobile alerts, and serving advertisements;</p>
<p>• to provide interactive features of our websites and mobile applications, such as product ratings and reviews, share with a friend, find item in store, store ads, push notifications and store locator;</p>
<p>• to improve your in-store experience in conjunction with our use of wireless beacons;</p>
<p>• to provide proximity-based features to customers, such as advertising  and “buy online, pick-up in store;”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As noted above, we may use the information we collect and receive to personalize your JCPenney experience across channels.
We may combine information to link your activity through one channel to your activity in another, such as linking information from your in-store activity to your activity on our websites, or linking your activity from one device to another, such as from a mobile device and a laptop computer.
Personalization allows JCPenney to target our advertisements and communications to deliver more relevant content to you based on how you interact with us.

<strong>cookies </strong>- A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or device.
When you arrive at our website, cookies allow us or our third-party service providers to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie.
We and our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site, whether through the Internet or mobile applications.
You may use the privacy settings on your web browser to disable cookies.
If so, you can still browse our websites, but you may not have as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs.

<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>web beacons</strong>- A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on website pages and in emails, advertising, and other marketing communications that allows us and our third-party service providers to determine whether you have performed specific actions.
When you access those pages or open email messages, or click on advertising, the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  That information is used to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site or mobile applications, and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail and advertising.</p>

<strong>notice to California residents - your California privacy rights</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>Under California law, a California resident with whom JCPenney has an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information JCPenney has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.
All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to:  J.
C.
Penney Corporation, Inc., P.O.
Box 10001, Dallas, TX 75301.  Attention: Corporate Customer Care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This same California law permits JCPenney to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information.
You may exercise that choice by any of the means described under “opt-out of sharing with other companies for their marketing purposes”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<strong>international customer privacy</strong>
<p>JCPenney has contracted with Borderfree, Inc.
(“Borderfree”) to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally (an “international order”).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you place an international order, you will submit personal information (e.g.
your name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and other order-related information to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  If you also choose to create a jcpenney.com account, any personal information you provide will also be transferred to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  Please note that United States law may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the laws in your home country.  This privacy policy applies to any personal information you furnish JCPenney in connection with international orders, your jcpenney.com account or otherwise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JCPenney will then share your international order information, including personal information about you, with Borderfree for the purpose of facilitating ordering and shipping internationally.  Borderfree will process personal information about you in accordance with its privacy policy.  Borderfree has agreed not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international orders and shipments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By placing an international order, you acknowledge and agree that JCPenney will transfer personal information about you to Borderfree, and acknowledge that your financial transaction and shipment will be processed by Borderfree.  During the checkout process, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once your order is approved, JCPenney will ship it to Borderfree.  Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product(s) you ordered from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and arrange for the product(s) to be delivered to you.  In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Customers shipping internationally should email us at privacy@jcpenneyeservices.com if they wish to:</p>
<p>• inquire about or update their personal information,</p>
<p>• make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information, or</p>
<p>• comment on or ask questions regarding JCPenney’s privacy policy,</p>
