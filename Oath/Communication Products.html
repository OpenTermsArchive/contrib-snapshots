 Communication Products <p>This policy describes our current privacy practices for the Oath Communications brands, websites, features, products, apps, software and other services (“Communications Services”).
All information collected, provided to Oath or stored in your Oath Account will be treated, used and protected in accordance with the Oath Privacy Policy.
This information may change as Oath revises these Communications Services by adding or removing features or using different service providers.
Some Communications Service features are only available if you are a registered user.</p>
<p>This page describes specific privacy practices with respect to Yahoo Address Book, Yahoo Calendar, Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Messenger or other instant messaging services and Yahoo Notepad.</p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use Practices - General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oath’s systems may analyze and store all communications content, including email content from incoming and outgoing mail, as well as incoming and outgoing messages to messaging apps.</li>
<li>We also may analyze and store all other content and other information you provide when you use our Communications Services.
This can include information within or about the content you provide, such as photos, attachments and other communications.</li>
<li>Our systems may analyze all communications content (such as Mail, Groups, Calendar, Address and Messenger content including instant messages and SMS messages) for the purposes outlined in our main Privacy Policy page.
If you provide Oath access to your Gmail data, please click here for more information on how we treat your Gmail data.</li>
<li>This analysis may occur on all communications content as it is sent, received, and when it is stored, including content from services synced with your account.
For example, in certain use cases, we run automated algorithms on commercial communications to create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to identify the elements of an airline receipt).
These templates do not include the recipient’s personal data.
Oath employees may review the templates to improve our services and our personalization of your experience.
We may also manually review certain communications to improve our masking template capabilities, develop tools to assist the automated scanning process, improve segmentation and other automated functions and create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to identify the elements of an airline receipt).
Our anti-spam team may review messages flagged as “spam” or “not spam” to improve our anti-spam defenses.</li>
<li>Our Communications Service may include interactive features from third-parties as well.
We do not share information that personally identifies you (such as information like your first and last name or email address) with the third-parties without your consent.</li>
<li>This information may also be used for interest-based advertising.
To learn more, you can visit Oath’s control tool for interest-based advertising.</li>
<li>Please read the FAQ to learn more about our Communications Services.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Communication Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users with whom you communicate with may opt to save your conversations even if you delete them.</li>
<li>If you have SMS message forwarding enabled, these messages may be stored in your conversation history on that device.</li>
<li>We may store the contacts and calendar details from Communications Services like Mail, Address Book, Messenger Contacts, Groups, and when you synchronize data from your devices (for example, your phone contacts).
<ul>
<li>Synced contacts from third-party services may re-populate after you delete them unless you disable the syncing feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sharing and Disclosure to Third-Parties</strong>
<ul>
<li>Connecting your account to a third-party service may require that you share information with that third party (for example, your email address).
You can view and disable third-party account links by visiting the accounts section in the Communications Service(s) you may use.</li>
<li>Certain information from your account may be visible to others such as your name, nickname, avatar, image, gender, city, online status, contact information associated with your Oath account or other information that you have chosen to make public.</li>
<li>If you post information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</li>
<li>Your messages are shared only with the people you want.
Oath may anonymously share specific objects from a message (such as keywords, package tracking and product price, name, identification and other data) with third-parties in order to enhance your user experience, develop new services and features and provide targeted ads.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Yahoo Mail </strong>
<strong>Premium Services</strong>
<ul>
<li>Premium services, such as Mail Plus, are available for a fee.</li>

<li>Oath may share certain analyzed elements of your communications, such as keywords, package tracking and product identification numbers, with third-parties in order to enhance your user experience and personalize your ads and content.</li>
<li>Our automated systems analyze content in part, to provide personally relevant, enriched experiences within mail.
 Enriched experiences show easy-to-read cards or similar formats within your inbox.<br> Some of these enriched experiences may include links, partnerships, or revenue sharing agreements where Yahoo receives compensation when you complete a purchase or take an action. </li>
<li>When users click on the Spam and Not Spam buttons, information is sent to our anti-spam team or other spam compliance service providers for manual review, and aspects of these messages may be shared with the sender to reduce spam.</li>
