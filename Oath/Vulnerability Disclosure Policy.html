 Security <p>Protecting our systems and our users’ information is paramount to ensuring Oath brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) users enjoy a secure experience and maintaining our users’ trust.
We have taken the following measures to protect your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS)<br> We use TLS encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information.
An icon resembling a padlock is displayed in most browsers during TLS sessions.</li>
<li>Second Sign-in Verification<br> For some Oath Services, you may turn on a setting that requires a second piece of information such as a code sent via SMS - in addition to your password - when signing in to your account from a device or location we don’t recognize.
Learn more about second sign-in verification.</li>
<li>On-Demand Passwords<br> Oath also offers on-demand passwords.
By linking your mobile device or mobile number to your account, you enable Oath to provide you with an on-demand password sent to your mobile phone, so you don't have to remember passwords anymore.
Learn more about on-demand passwords.</li>
<li>Vendors and Partners<br> To help protect the security and privacy of your information, we may provide information to partners and vendors who work on our behalf or with us under confidentiality agreements.</li>
<li>Education and Training<br> We have implemented a company-wide education and training program about security for Oath employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We continue to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices.</p>
