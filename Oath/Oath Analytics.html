 Verizon Media Analytics <p>Verizon Media Analytics, Advertising Insights, and Flurry are systems used by Verizon Media to collect information about visitors to Verizon Media's and our customers' products and services to understand how people use those services and respond to the ads we serve.</p>
<strong>Information Collection &amp.
Use</strong>
<p>Analytics tools such as Verizon Media Analytics, Advertising Insights, and Flurry use a variety of tools, including but not limited to, IP Addresses, web beacons, SDKs, cookies, and similar technologies to recognize, associate, and collect data about visitors to Verizon Media's and our customer’s sites, apps, products, brands and services.
This data is sent to Verizon Media by your device.
The data collected commonly includes information such as cookies and/or device identifiers, IP address, time spent, your interactions, links clicked, your location, apps on the device, or advertisements viewed.
This data is collected by Verizon Media Analytics and other tools so that Verizon Media can report statistical information and recognize unique users.</p>
<p>We collect this information on our own brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) and on behalf of our customers, such as our advertisers and publishers, so that they can assess the effectiveness of their services.
Certain customers may also provide us with information that on its own could reasonably identify a customer such as email address to incorporate into analytics reports produced exclusively for them.</p>
<p>Verizon Media also may use the data collected through Verizon Media Analytics and other tools in order to improve our Services, provide advertisements about goods and Services and content of interest to users and for the purposes disclosed in the Verizon Media Privacy Policy.
Verizon Media may use cookies and similar technologies to associate users, devices, and accounts with each other or with those in a similar location, such as in a household.</p>

<p>The following provides additional information about some of the practices and technologies that we implement to collect, use and share data. </p>
<strong>Analytics</strong>
<p>The Verizon Media Group serves nearly one billion users across the world every day.
Operating Internet services at this scale requires us to understand how our systems, networks, and products are performing.
To achieve this, much of the data we collect is aggregated and analyzed through our analytics platforms.</p>
<p>These platforms generate necessary reporting and useful insights into every area of our business, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial reporting, accounting, billing, and auditing</li>
<li>Business development, understanding industry trends, competitive analyses, brand marketing, and mergers and acquisitions</li>
<li>Measuring the performance of our vendors and partners</li>
<li>System and network performance monitoring and operation, capacity planning, troubleshooting, traffic optimization, load balancing, and related operational purposes</li>
<li>Security, anti-fraud, anti-spam, and anti-abuse</li>
<li>Measuring the performance and effectiveness of ad systems, campaigns, and partnerships for us and our partners</li>
<li>Product improvement, new product and new feature development</li>
<li>Aggregate audience insights for us and our partners</li>
<li>Aggregate site, app, and product analytics for us and our partners</li>
</ul>
<p>When we share aggregate reports with our partners, we only provide statistical summaries of data.
This means that we do not provide user-identifying records to partners.
For more information, see ‘How we Share Your Information’ in <u>Verizon Media Privacy Policy</u>.</p>
<strong>Product improvement and development</strong>
<p>We strive to continually improve our existing Products and to develop new offerings we think our users will find useful and enjoy.
We prioritise these efforts based on feedback we receive from our users, market research, industry trends, and data we collect about how our current Products are being used.
In most cases, we use aggregate data for product improvement and development, which means it does not involve user-level inferences or analyses.</p>
<p>Examples of data uses for product improvement and development include:</p>
<ul>
<li>User experience testing</li>
<li>Quality assurance and product testing (including security testing)</li>
<li>Bug detection and resolution</li>
<li>Measuring product performance (for example, the time it takes pages and apps to load)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Security and operations</strong>
<p>Our systems are configured to automatically collect and use data for security and operational purposes.
We generally retain this data for short periods, though we keep some event data for longer periods to detect, mitigate, or prosecute malicious or criminal activity.
We aggregate data into statistical reports to help understand system and network performance over time.</p>
<p>Examples of security and operational uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>System and network performance monitoring</li>
<li>Security analysis (such as intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing)</li>
<li>Failure and outage detection and repair</li>
<li>Troubleshooting and debugging</li>
<li>Capacity planning and forecasting</li>
<li>Traffic optimisation and load balancing</li>
<li>Measuring vendor and partner systems and network performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the critical nature of these activities to our business, Verizon Media does not offer you choices or controls over the use of data for security and operational purposes.</p>
<strong>Personalised experiences</strong>
<p>This section provides additional information about some of the specific practices that we use to personalise the experiences that we show you, like ads or articles.
Check out How Digital Advertising Works for an overview of how we use your data to personalise your ads. </p>
<p>Our personalised experiences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>seeing more of the content, articles, ads and videos you enjoy or have shown an interest</li>
<li>suggesting new content or products we think you might like based on your previous activity</li>
<li>remembering your recent activity like recent stock quotes or your web searches</li>
</ul>
<p>The techniques that we use to help us personalise your experiences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linking household, account, device and cookie identifiers</li>
<li>Processing IP addresses</li>
<li>Browser and devices with limited cookie support</li>
<li>Smart TVs and interactive devices</li>
<li>Cookies, beacons, scripts and SDKs</li>
<li>Automated processing and machine learning</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linking household, account, device, and cookie identifiers</strong>
<p>Verizon Media uses different techniques to link unique identifiers present in households, accounts, devices, and cookies and other technologies that likely belong to the same user or are present in the same household.
These identifiers are linked through common elements like shared IP addresses, shared use of a device or a mobile app, account logins across multiple devices, and identifier match and linkage data provided by third parties.</p>
<p>The types of identifiers we collect and process include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email addresses (both account email and alternate email addresses)</li>
<li>Phone numbers</li>
<li>Cookies or other technologies that contain unique identifiers</li>
<li>Apple iOS Advertising ID and Vendor ID</li>
<li>Google Android ID and Play Store Advertising ID</li>
<li>Household identifiers</li>
<li>IP address (version 4 and version 6)</li>
<li>Cryptographic hashes and derivative values of any of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect and link these elements even if you are not logged in to a Product, for example, when you use a Product that does not require a login or where you interact with our Services on a third party website.</p>
<p>These identifiers are typically associated with data that is collected, observed, or inferred from Verizon Media users or derived from data that we receive from our partners.</p>
<p>We link identifiers to increase the usefulness of the data we collect from different contexts and over time.
For instance, users that conduct web searches for sports scores of certain teams may be interested in seeing additional stories or videos about those teams in their news feed.</p>
<p>You have choices about how your data is linked.
You can opt-out of identifier linking of individual browsers and mobile devices by using the Device Linking control in <u>Your Privacy Controls</u>.</p>
<strong>Processing IP addresses</strong>
<p>Your device’s IP address is sent to Verizon Media whenever you interact with one of our Products or Services.
Third parties may also receive and pass your IP address to us when you interact with their products.
Likewise, Verizon Media may relay your IP address to partners that we use to show content, ads and related products on our Products.</p>
<p>We collect your IP addresses over time to:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintain the security of your account, data, and our systems, and networks</li>
<li>defend against fraud, spam, phishing, abuse, and other malicious activity</li>
<li>troubleshoot network, system, and related operational issues</li>
<li>determine your country or geographic region to: <ul>
<li>identify your legal jurisdiction and the rights associated with your account</li>
<li>provide you with more relevant content and ads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>limit the frequency of ads over time on devices without cookie support</li>
<li>understand your approximate home and work locations</li>
<li>link devices, browsers, and user accounts that may be associated in the same household or workplace</li>
<li>create aggregate statistics showing product usage by geographic region</li>
</ul>
<strong>Browsers and devices with limited cookie support </strong>
<p>Verizon Media collects and uses previously collected data from browsers and devices with limited cookie support, such as those enabled with cookie-blocking technology.
In these cases, we generate a temporary ‘passive ID’ using various network signals to probabilistically identify such devices and improve our Products.</p>
<p>You can manage certain uses of passive IDs on these devices via the ‘Verizon Media Across the Web’ control located in Your Privacy Controls.
Some cookie-blocking technologies may interfere with device, platform, and self-regulatory privacy controls so we recommend using the ‘Verizon Media Across the Web’ control in these cases.</p>
<strong>Smart Devices </strong>
<p>We collect data from smart or connected TVs, ‘over-the-top’ streaming devices, and related interactive devices (collectively, ‘Smart Devices’) via TV apps that we operate, or Services we provide on these devices.</p>
<p>We link Smart Devices and associated data by common attributes (like IP address) and then group those devices into households.</p>
<p>In some cases, Smart Devices provide Verizon Media additional specific information to facilitate linking and targeting, like a TV device identifier or user login data.
Please consult the privacy disclosures in your specific Smart Device for practices and controls that manage data collection and use.</p>
<strong>Cookies, Beacons, Scripts, SDKs </strong>
<p>We collect data on browsers, mobile phones, and related devices using industry-standard methods.
These methods include using cookies, beacons, web storage, SDKs, tags and pixels, which we collectively refer to as ‘cookies and other technologies’.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we collect and use your data using cookies and other technologies visit our Cookie Policy.</p>
<strong>Automated Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Modeling </strong>
<p>We use various automated data processing techniques, like data models and machine learning, to improve our algorithms and the efficiency of all aspects of our Products and Services.</p>
<p>The aspects of our Products and Services where we use automated data processing techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>system performance and monitoring</li>
<li>security and operational efficiency</li>
<li>content personalization</li>
<li>predictive analytics</li>
<li>programmatic advertising</li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques combine and use data from information sources to continually update and optimize these functions.</p>
<p>With the exception of automated processing needed to secure our systems, you have choices about our use of your data when such processing results in an inference about you or your activity.
Visit Your Privacy Controls for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that our automated processing does not produce legal effects or other similarly significant effects about you.</p>
