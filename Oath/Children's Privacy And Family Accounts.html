<strong>Information Collection, Use, Sharing and Disclosure Practices</strong>

This information may include (but is not limited to) name, gender, birthdate, geolocation information, search queries, mobile device identifier, mobile phone number, alternative email addresses, contacts, contact information (including online contact information), nicknames and aliases, physical address, IP address, other persistent identifiers, and any other information your child may share with us or our partners, such as photos, videos or audio files that contain your child's image or voice.</li>
<li>Your child may disclose this or other information to us, our partners, or the public when using our and our partners' products and services.</li>
<li>Oath and our partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect information from your child, including on every page of our website and in all of our products and services, which may occur on other websites.

<strong>Practices Regarding Your Ability to Update or Delete Information</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your child's account is different than your account.
You will need to sign in as your child to review or make changes to their account.</li>
<li>You entered or reviewed your child's ID and password when you provided your consent for the creation of your child's account.
If you have forgotten your child's ID and password or have trouble accessing the account, please use our account recovery tool.</li>
<li>You may revoke your consent to Oath and our partners' collection, use, and disclosure of your child's personal information at any time, by signing into your child's account and then visiting our Account Deletion page.
If you delete your child's account, we will delete existing personal information we have about your child and we will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose further personal information from or about your child.
Some site usage data may remain on our logs.</li>
