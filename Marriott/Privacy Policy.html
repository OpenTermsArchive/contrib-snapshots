<p>Our Website uses "cookie" technology.
"Cookies" are encrypted strings of text that a Web site stores on a user's computer.
Our Web site requires the use of a Cookie throughout the online reservation process.
Without Cookies we will not be able to keep information you enter on multiple pages together.
For example, unless Marriott.com and Ritzcarlton.com can remember the dates you used in your hotel search, we will not be able to check room availability.
Cookies also enable us to customize our Web site and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience on Marriott.com and Ritzcarlton.com.
In addition, Cookies are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow registered users to sign in without typing their email/Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Rewards number each time;</li>
<li>Measure usage of various pages on our Web site to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access.
and</li>
<li>Provide functionality such as online reservations, Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Rewards transactions, and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of Cookies that we use are referred to as "session" Cookies and "persistent" Cookies.

This technology uses information about your visits to this Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personally identifiable information), to serve our ads to you.
In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party persistent Cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.
In addition, we use beacon gifs (see description below), provided by our ad-serving providers, to help manage our online advertising.
These beacon gifs enable our ad server to recognize a browser's Cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site and whether a reservation on Marriott.com is executed.

</p> Pixel Tags <p>Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and its third-party service providers use pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" "beacon gifs" etc.).
Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Web site and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the Web page.
Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott and Ritz-Carlton.
Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and our email service provider use pixel tags to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track customer response to Marriott and Ritz-Carlton advertisements and Web site content;</li>
<li>Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.
Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.
The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.
This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.
The sensor does not collect or use any other information.
If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;</li>
