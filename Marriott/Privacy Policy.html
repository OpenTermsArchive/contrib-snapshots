<li>Additional contact information about you that we may obtain through third parties with whom we do business (e.g.
travel agents or similar providers);</li>
<li>Profile picture;</li>
<li>Social media account ID or user ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services (e.g., if you make a reservation for another individual), you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Through Our Online Services: </b>We may collect Personal Information when you make a reservation or otherwise purchase goods and services from us, communicate with us via online chat services, inform us of any special requests or preferences you may have, or sign up for a newsletter or participate in a survey, contest, or promotional offer.</li>
<li>
<b>Through Our Offline Services: </b>We may collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you visit one of our branded properties, make a reservation over the phone or contact customer service.</li>
<li>
<b>From Other Sources: </b>We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and other third parties.
This may include information from your travel agent, airline, credit card, and other partners, and from social media platforms (including from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected).
For example, if you elect to login to, connect with or link to, the Online Services using your social media account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.</li>
<li>
<b>From Authorized Licensees: </b>Marriott Group companies may from time to time enter into a license or similar agreement with a third party to sell products and services under a Marriott Group brand.

<li>To provide the services you request, such as to facilitate reservations, send confirmations or pre-arrival messages, to assist you with meetings, events or celebrations, and provide you with other information about the area and the hotel at which you are scheduled to stay.</li>
<li>To complete and fulfill your reservation and stay, for example, to process your payment, ensure that your room is available, and provide you with related customer service.</li>
<li>In connection with our eFolio program.
Your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number, as entered on your reservation, acts as an eFolio identifier, allowing the transmission of your bill to your email address.
If your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number is applied to another person's room reservation, or if you make a reservation for another person and provide your email address for that reservation, that person's bill will be transmitted to your email address as well.
It is your responsibility to inform that person that his or her bill will be emailed to you when your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number or email address is attached to his/her reservation unless he/she makes alternative arrangements with a front desk during the stay.</li>
<li>To send you administrative information, marketing communications, promotional offers, periodic customer satisfaction, market research or quality assurance surveys.</li>
<li>To personalize your experience when you stay in one of our hotels and with respect to the Online Services by presenting products and offers tailored to you.</li>
<li>To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and other promotions and to administer these activities.
Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information.
We suggest that you read any such rules carefully.</li>
<li>For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention (including through the use of closed circuit television, card keys, and other security systems), developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use Personal Information in connection with loyalty programs such as Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send you information regarding your account status and activities;</li>
<li>Assess the benefits to which you are entitled;</li>
<li>Administer points earned through the Marriott Rewards Credit Card;</li>
<li>Manage your choices regarding how you wish to earn points (e.g., participating airlines and other company loyalty programs) and track your points and transaction activity.</li>

Please note that this Privacy Statement does not address any information you subsequently provide directly to one of these third-parties, such as information necessary to reserve a rental car.</li>
<li>
<b>eFolio Program: </b>If you are an employee of a company that participates in Marriott's eFolio Program and pay for your hotel expenses (hotel folio) at a Marriott participating property using the corporate credit card that your employer provided to you, an extract of your hotel folio detailing the goods and services provided to you during your hotel stay will be sent to the credit card company or its agents, who will in turn provide that extract to your employer to facilitate employee expense processing.

By connecting your Online Services account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
If you do not want your Personal Information shared with other users or with your social media account provider, please do not connect your social media account with your Online Services account and do not participate in social sharing on the Online Services.<br>
<br>
In addition, when you elect to post information on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including, without limitation, our Social Media Pages) any such information you post or disclose through these services will become public and may be available to other users and the general public.
We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose any information on the Online Services.</li>
<li>
<b>Corporate Reorganization: </b>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
