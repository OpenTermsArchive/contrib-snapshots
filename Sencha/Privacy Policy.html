From time to time, the Company may partner with other companies to jointly offer products, services or programs (such as webinars or downloadable content) such as our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about the Company and its products.
To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

<i>Company Affiliates</i>

Use of Cookies
<p>
<strong>
<i>Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses</i>
</strong>
<br>
The Company uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Websites (“Website Navigational Information”).
As described more fully below, we and our partners use these cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer Websites and Services, track users’ movements around our Websites and Services, serve targeted advertisements and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
This section describes the types of Website Navigational Information used on the Company’s Websites and Services, and how this information may be used.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data</i>
</strong>
<br>
As is true of most Company Websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Company’s Websites and Services.
This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage.
Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website.
This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services.
For example, the Company uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and website visitors navigate the Company’s Websites.
The Company also collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Cookies</i>
</strong>
<br>
The Company uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Websites easy and meaningful.
When you visit one of the Company’s Websites, the Company’s servers send a cookie to your computer or device.
Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you.
they merely recognize your Web browser.
Unless you choose to identify yourself to the Company, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Request a Demo” or a “Request a Quote” Web form) or have previously identified yourself to the Company, you remain anonymous to the Company.</p>
<p>The Company uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist only during one session.
They disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Company’s Websites or Services.</p>
<p>The following sets out how the Company uses different categories of cookies.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Required Cookies:</i>
</strong>
<br>
Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company’s Websites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Websites and using the Company Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to the Company, the Company may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier.
These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Company’s Websites and Services and to process your online transactions and requests.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Functionality Cookies:</i>
</strong>
<br>
Functionality cookies allow the Company’s Websites and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Company’s Websites and Services after logging in.
These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.</p>
<p>Functional cookies may also be used to improve how the Company’s Websites and Services function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with the Company, and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications.
These cookies collect information about how website visitors use our Websites and Services, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages.</p>
<p>The Company may use its own technology (under the Company brand name or an affiliated brand name) or third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from website visitors, attendees, and customers, to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of the Company’s advertisements.
The Company and its third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for these purposes.
Flash cookies and HTML local storage are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
The Company also uses Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Company Websites and Services to personalize your visit.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Targeting or Advertising Cookies:</i>
</strong>
<br>
The Company sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for the Company products and services that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of the Company advertisements.
For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited the Company’s Websites.
The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it.
If the Company is using one of its own cookie-related products on our own Website, then a cookie related to ads may appear on our Website under the Company or one of our affiliated company’s name.</p>
<p>The Company also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below) on the Company’s Websites and Services, from emails, and on third-party Websites.
Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies.
These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet.
Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests.
You may see these advertisements on other Websites or mobile applications on any of your devices.
This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>Do Not Track </i>
</strong>
<br>
Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Websites’ visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting.
The Company does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Company’s Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
The Company takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
8.
Links to Other Websites and Public Forums
<p>Our Websites contain links to information on other websites.
We do not have any control over these other websites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those websites.
Those websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you have questions about how a website uses your information, consult that website’s privacy statement.
Portions of this website may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors.
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.</p>
