id="deliveroo-terms-of-service">Deliveroo Terms Of Service</h2><p><strong>Last updated</strong>: 10 August 2020</p><p>Welcome to Deliveroo. This page (together with the documents referred to in it) tells you the terms (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) which apply when you order any menu items (the <strong>&quot;Items&quot;</strong>) from our deliveroo.co.uk website or mobile applications and related services (each referred to as an <strong>“Application”</strong>). </p><p>Please read these Terms carefully before ordering any Items from our Application. If you have any questions relating to these Terms please contact support@deliveroo.ie before you place an order. If you are a consumer, you have certain legal rights when you order Items using our Application. You can find more information about these rights at: <a  href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/">https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/</a> and from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), https://www.ccpc.ie. Your legal rights are not affected by these Terms, which apply in addition to them and do not replace them.  By setting up your Deliveroo account, you confirm that you accept these Terms.</p><h3>1. Information About Us</h3><p>Deliveroo Ireland Limited is a company incorporated and registered in Ireland, with a registered office at The Stone Building, 15 Flemmings Place, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, D04 P6W3.  Our Company registration number is 556923. Our VAT number is 3332774RH. You may contact us at support@deliveroo.ie or by using the instant messaging facility on our Application.</p><h3>2. Purpose</h3><p>Our objective is to link you to the restaurants we partner with (<strong>“Partner Restaurants&quot;</strong>) and allow you to order Items for delivery (our “<strong>Service</strong>”). Where you order from a Partner Restaurant, Deliveroo acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner Restaurant to conclude your order from our Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Once you have placed an order, delivery of your Items will be arranged by Deliveroo (<strong>“Deliveroo Delivery”</strong>) or our Partner Restaurant (<strong>“Partner Delivery</strong>) (each a “<strong>Delivery</strong>”) depending on the Partner Restaurant you have selected. In some cases, the Partner Restaurant may be owned by or affiliated with us. </p><h3>3. Your Account</h3><p>Before you can place orders for Items using our Application, you need to open a Deliveroo account. When you open an account you may create a password, or other secure login method, and may also have to provide credit card details. You must keep any password you create, or other secure login method, secret, and prevent others from accessing your email account or mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access your account, you will be responsible to pay for any Items they order, and we are not responsible for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your password obtained it because we did not keep it secure. </p><p>You may close your account at any time by requesting to do so in your account section of our website or contacting us using the contact details above. We may suspend your access to your account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your account has been used by someone else. We may also close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Service (for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff or riders, or any other good reason). If we close your account permanently we will refund any remaining account credit you have validly obtained from our customer service team or Application following any issue with an order, by applying a credit to your registered credit card, or if that is not possible for any reason, by way of a bank transfer using bank details (provided you have supplied them to us).</p><h3>4. Service Availability</h3><p>Each Partner Restaurant has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area may change at any time due to factors such as weather, or demand on our service. This is to ensure that Items reach your door at their best. Our Partner Restaurants each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Service, and the range of Partner Restaurants from which you can order, depends on the Partner Restaurants in your area. If you try to order a delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating hours of a Partner Restaurant, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.</p><h3>5. Orders</h3><p>When you place an order through our Application, it needs to be accepted by us or the Partner Restaurant before it is confirmed. We will send you a notification if your order has been accepted (the <strong>&quot;Confirmation Notice&quot;</strong>). The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for paying for all Items ordered using your account, and for related delivery charges, and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. Some Partner Restaurants operate a minimum order value policy. This will be displayed on our Application. All Items are subject to availability.  Partner Restaurants may use nuts or other allergens in the preparation of certain Items. Please contact our Partner Restaurant prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Deliveroo cannot guarantee that any of the Items sold by our Partner Restaurants are free of allergens.</p><h3>6. Delivery</h3><p>When you place an order you will have the choice to place it as an ASAP Delivery or a Scheduled Delivery. For an ASAP Delivery, we will tell you an estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, <strong>but we will attempt delivery as soon as possible</strong>; you must therefore be available to accept delivery from the time you place the order. For a Scheduled Delivery, we will tell you the time when the Item is expected to be delivered; you must be available to accept delivery for ten minutes before and ten minutes after that time.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite our, and our Partner Restaurant’s best efforts, things do not always go to plan and factors such as traffic and weather conditions may prevent us from delivering your Item on time. If your order is more than 15 minutes late, and we haven’t notified you giving you the option to cancel your order, we will work with you to make things right unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you gave us the wrong address or did not come to the door).</p><p>We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place your order. If you need to change the delivery location after you have placed your order, we may be able to change to the address to an alternative one that is registered with your account if you let us know before the rider has been dispatched, and the new address is within the same zone as the address you originally ordered your Item to. If we cannot change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel the order, but if food preparation has started you will be charged the full price for the Item, and if the rider has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.</p><p>You will still be charged for the Item and for delivery in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):  </p><ul><li>You do not come to the door, did not pick up the phone when the rider contacted you using the contact information you have provided us and/or you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the rider is unable to find a safe location to leave the food. </li><li>The rider refuses to deliver the Item to you in accordance with section 8 (Age Restricted Products).</li></ul><h3>7. Your Rights if Something is Wrong With Your Items</h3><p>You have a legal right to receive goods which comply with their description, which are of satisfactory quality and which comply with any specific requirements you tell us about (and we agree to) before you place your order. If you believe that the Items you have been delivered do not comply with these legal rights, please let us know. We may request a photograph showing the problem if it is something that can be seen by inspecting the Items. We will provide a refund or account credit in respect of the affected part of the Item, and also in respect of delivery if the whole order was affected, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused after delivery. </p><p>Prior to processing your refund or account credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the order, including your account history, what happened on delivery and information from the Partner Restaurant. </p><h3>8. Age Restricted Products</h3><p>Age restricted products (including, without limitation, alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes) can only be sold and delivered to persons aged 18 or over. By placing an order for an age restricted product, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. Deliveroo operates an age verification policy whereby customers ordering age restricted products will be asked by the rider to provide proof that they are aged 18 or over. The rider may refuse to deliver any age restricted product to any person unless they can provide valid photo ID proving that they are aged 18 or over. The Partner Restaurant and the rider may refuse to deliver alcohol to any person who is, or appears to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs. If delivery of any age restricted product is refused, you will still be charged for the relevant Item and for delivery.</p><h3>9. Cancellation</h3><p>You may cancel an order without charge at any time before the Restaurant Partner has started preparing the food (a <strong>&quot;Started Order&quot;</strong>). If you wish to cancel an order before it becomes a Started Order, please contact us immediately, via our Application. If the Partner Restaurant confirms the order was not a Started Order, we will refund your payment (excluding any discount, or Voucher that was applied to the order - see Voucher and Account Credit Terms for more detail). If you cancel any order after it becomes a Started Order, you will be charged the full price for the Items, and if the rider has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.  </p><p>Deliveroo and the Partner Restaurant may notify you that an order has been cancelled at any time. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by us or the Partner Restaurant, and we will reimburse you for any payment already made using the same method you used to pay for your order. We may also apply credit to your account to reflect the inconvenience caused.</p><h3>10. Prices, Payments and Offers</h3><p>Prices include VAT. You confirm that you are using our Service for personal, non-commercial use. Deliveroo may operate dynamic pricing some of the time, which means that prices of Items and delivery may change while you are browsing. Prices can also change at any time at the discretion of the Partner Restaurants. We reserve the right to charge a Service Fee, which may be subject to change, for the provision of our Services.  You will be notified of any applicable Service Fee and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application.  No changes will affect existing confirmed orders, unless there is an obvious pricing mistake. Nor will changes to prices affect any orders in process and appearing within your basket, provided you complete the order within 2 hours of creating the basket. If you do not conclude the order before the 2 hour cut-off the items will be removed from your basket automatically and the price change will apply.<strong><em> </em></strong>If there is an obvious pricing mistake we will notify you as soon as we can and you will have the choice of confirming the order at the original price or cancelling the order without charge and with a full refund of any money already paid.  Where Deliveroo or any Partner Restaurants make a delivery, we or the Partner Restaurant may also charge you a delivery fee. This will be notified to you during the order process before you complete your order.</p><p>The total price of your order will be set out on the checkout page on our Application, including the prices of Items and Delivery and applicable Service Fees and taxes.</p><p>Payment for all Items and deliveries can be made on our Application by credit or debit card, or other payment method made available by Deliveroo. Once your order has been confirmed your credit or debit card will be authorised and the total amount marked for payment. Payment is made directly to Deliveroo acting as agent on behalf of the Partner Restaurant only. Payment may also be made by using vouchers or account credit. Use of these is subject to Deliveroo&#39;s Voucher and Account Credit Terms.</p><p>We are authorised by our Partner Restaurants to accept payment on their behalf and payment of the price of any Items or delivery charges to us will fulfil your obligation to pay the price to the Partner Restaurant. In some cases, you can alternatively make your payment in cash directly to the Partner Restaurant by paying the rider at the time of delivery.  Where cash payment is possible, this will be made clear on our Application before you place your order.</p><p>Partner Restaurants sometimes make special offers available through our Application. These are visible when you look at a Partner Restaurant menu. These offers are at the discretion of the Partner Restaurants. Unless the offer terms state a fixed or minimum period for which an offer will be available, it can be withdrawn at any time, unless you have already placed an order based on the offer and we have sent the Confirmation Notice.</p><h3>11. Tips</h3><p><strong>When Placing Your Order:</strong></p><p>When you place an order, you will have the option to pay a tip to your rider or the restaurant,  in addition to the purchase price of the Items in your order. Any payment will be collected by Deliveroo using the payment method used for the original order and your rider or the restaurant will receive 100% of any payment you choose to make.</p><p><strong>After You’ve Received Your Order:</strong></p><p>Once you’ve received your order, you may receive a notification giving you the chance to pay a tip to your rider. Deliveroo will collect payment on behalf of the rider, as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the tips shall be considered a direct payment from you to the rider. We’ll share your first name with your rider when we notify them of the tip. Your rider will receive 100% of any payment you choose to make. As this payment is made after you receive your order, this payment is non-refundable and does not form part of your order. Depending on the payment method used for your original order, your tip may show up on your bank/credit card statement as a separate payment.</p><h3>12. Our Responsibility for Loss and Damage That You Suffer</h3><p>We are responsible to you for any loss or damage that you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these Terms or of failing to use reasonable care and skill in relation to your use of our Service. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is “foreseeable” if it is either obvious that it will happen, or if you told us that it might happen, for example if you tell us about particular circumstances that might increase the loss or damage arising from our breach of these Terms before you place an order. </p><p>We do not exclude or limit our responsibility to you for loss or damage where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes any responsibility for death or personal injury caused by our failure, or our employees’, agents’ or subcontractors’ failure, to use reasonable care and skill; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Items, as summarised at part 7 above; or for defective Items under the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Subject to the previous paragraph, we are not responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer as a result of your own breach of these Terms, or as a result of any IT hardware or software failure other than a failure in our Applications.  </p><h3>13. Data Protection</h3><p>We process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy which can be found <a  href="https://deliveroo.co.uk/privacy">here</a>. </p><h3>14. Other Terms</h3><p>If either we or you have any right to enforce these Terms against the other, that right will not be lost even if the person who has the right delays enforcing it, or waives their right to enforce it in any instance.  If a court or other authority decides that any part of these Terms is illegal or ineffective, the rest of the terms will be unaffected and will remain in force. </p><p>We may change these Terms from time to time. If we make any changes which affect your rights in relation to our Service, we will notify you. Changes to the Terms will not affect any orders you have placed where we have sent the Confirmation Notice. These Terms are governed by the law of Ireland and you can bring legal proceedings in relation to our Service in the Irish courts.. We are required by EU law to provide <a  href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN">this link</a> to the EU’s online dispute resolution portal, however we do not participate in dispute resolution under this process.</p><p></p><h2 id="deliveroo-terms-of-use-for-website-and-applications">Deliveroo Terms Of Use For Website And Applications</h2><p>This page (together with the documents referred to on it) tells you the terms of use on which you may make use of our website deliveroo.ie (and all pages attaching to and including this domain name) (our <strong>&quot;Site&quot;</strong>) or any application we make available via an app store or otherwise (our <strong>&quot;Service&quot;</strong>), whether as a guest or a registered user.

If you have any questions relating to these Terms please contact support@deliveroo.ie before you place a Table Service Order. If you are a consumer, you have certain legal rights when you order Items using our Application.  <a  href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/">https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/</a> and from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), https://www.ccpc.ie.. Your legal rights are not affected by these Terms, which apply in addition to them and do not replace them.  By setting up your Deliveroo account, you confirm that you accept these Terms.</p><h3>1. Information About Us</h3><p>Deliveroo Ireland Limited is a company incorporated and registered in Ireland, with a registered office at The Stone Building, 15 Flemmings Place, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, D04 P6W3.  Our Company registration number is 556923. Our VAT number is 3332774RH. You may contact us at support@deliveroo.ie or by using the instant messaging facility on our Application.</p><h3>2. Purpose</h3><p>Our objective is to link you to the restaurants, cafes and pubs we partner with (“Partners&quot;) and allow you to order Items (our “Service”). Where you order from a Partner, Deliveroo acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner to conclude your Table Service Order from our Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Once you have placed a Table Service Order, the Partner will deliver these to the table using the information you specified when ordering (the “Table Service Location”). In some cases, the Partner may be owned by or affiliated with us.  </p><h3>3. Your Account</h3><p>Before you can place Table Service Orders using our Application, you need to open a Deliveroo account. When you open an account you may create a password, or other secure login method, and may also have to provide credit card details. You must keep any password you create, or other secure login method, secret, and prevent others from accessing your email account or mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access your account, you will be responsible to pay for any Items they order and we are not responsible for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your password obtained it because we did not keep it secure.</p><p>You may close your account at any time by requesting to do so in your account section of our website or contacting us using the contact details above. We may suspend your access to your account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your account has been used by someone else. We may also close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Service (for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff, or any other good reason). If we close your account permanently we will refund any remaining account credit you have validly obtained from our customer service team or Application following any issue with a Table Service Order, by applying a credit to your registered credit card, or if that is not possible for any reason, by way of a bank transfer using bank details (provided you have supplied them to us).</p><h3>4. Service Availability</h3><p>Each Partner has a prescribed area within which it can accept Table Service Orders. You should be inside the Partner’s site before placing your Table Service Order. </p><p>Our Partners each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Service, and the range of Partners from which you can order to Table Service, depends on the Partners in your area. If you try to place a Table Service Order with a Partner when you are not in the prescribed area for Table Service Orders, or you try to place a Table Service Order outside the operating hours of a Partner, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.</p><h3>5. Table Service Orders</h3><p>When you place a Table Service Order through our Application, it needs to be accepted by us or the Partner before it is confirmed. Your Table Service Order may be rejected at any time.  Our Partners may, for example, reject your Table Service Order if they are too busy or the Items you have ordered are temporarily unavailable.   </p><p>We will send you a notification if your Table Service Order has been accepted (the &quot;Confirmation Notice&quot;). The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for paying for all Items ordered using your account and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. Some Partners operate a minimum order value policy. This will be displayed on our Application. All Items are subject to availability.   </p><p>Partners may use nuts or other allergens in the preparation of certain Items. Please contact our Partner prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Deliveroo cannot guarantee that any of the Items sold by our Partners are free of allergens.</p><h3>6. Table Service</h3><p>When you place a Table Service Order which is accepted by the Partner, the Partner will tell you the time when your Items are expected to be ready for Table Service (“Target Table Service Time”). The Target Table Service Time is not guaranteed by either us or our Partner. You may be required to collect your Items directly from the Partner at the Table Service Location. You should be seated at the Partner’s site by the Target Table Service Time. You will still be charged for the Table Service Order in the event you fail to collect your Table Service Order from the Partner. Unfortunately despite our Partners’ best efforts things do not always go to plan and there may be times when your Table Service Order is not ready at the Target Table Service Time. If you wish to make a complaint, please do so with the Partner directly (the partner will resolve the situation at their discretion). </p><h3>7. Your Rights if Something is Wrong With Your Items</h3><p>You have a legal right to receive goods which comply with their description, which are of satisfactory quality and which comply with any specific requirements you tell the Partner about (and the Partner agrees to) before you place your Table Service Order. If you believe that the Items you have picked up do not comply with these legal rights, please contact the Partner. </p><h3>8. Age Restricted Products</h3><p>Age restricted products (including, without limitation, alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes) can only be sold to persons aged 18 or over. By placing a Table Service Order for an age restricted product, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. Deliveroo operates an age verification policy whereby customers who order age restricted products may be asked by the Partner to provide proof that they are aged 18 or over. The Partner may refuse to sell any age restricted product to any person unless they can provide a valid photo ID proving that they are aged 18 or over. The Partner may also refuse to sell alcohol to any person who is, or appears to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs. If the sale of any age restricted product is refused, the Partner may in its discretion process a refund for the relevant Item to the card from which you paid for your Table Service Order. </p><h3>9. Cancellation</h3><p>You may cancel a Table Service Order without charge at any time before the Partner has accepted your Table Service Order. If the Partner has not accepted your Table Service Order your payment will be refunded (excluding any discount, or Voucher that was applied to the Table Service Order - see Voucher and Account Credit Terms for more detail). If you wish to cancel a Table Service Order that has been accepted by the Partner, please contact the Partner directly. If you cancel any Table Service Order after it has been accepted you will be charged the full price for the Items. </p><p>Deliveroo and the Partner may notify you that a Table Service Order has been cancelled at any time. You will not be charged for any Table Service Orders cancelled by us or the Partner, and you will be reimbursed for by whichever of us cancelled your order. </p><h3>10. Prices, Payment and Offers</h3><p>Prices include VAT. You confirm that you are using our Service for personal, non-commercial use. Deliveroo may operate dynamic pricing some of the time, which means that prices of Items may change while you are browsing. Prices can also change at any time at the discretion of our Partners. We reserve the right to charge a Service Fee, which may be subject to change, for the provision of our Services. You will be notified of any applicable Service Fee and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application. No changes will affect existing confirmed Table Service Orders, unless there is an obvious pricing mistake. Nor will changes to prices affect any Table Service Orders in process and appearing within your basket, provided you complete and place the Table Service Order within 2 hours of creating the basket. If you do not conclude the Table Service Order before the 2 hour cut-off, the items will be removed from your basket automatically and the price change will apply if you re-add the relevant items to your basket.<em> </em>If there is an obvious pricing mistake we will notify you as soon as we can and you will have the choice of confirming the Table Service Order at the original price or cancelling the Table Service Order without charge and with a full refund of any money already paid.</p><p>The total price of your Table Service Order will be set out on the checkout page on our Application, including the prices of Items and applicable Service Fees and taxes.</p><p>We are authorised by our Partners to accept payment on their behalf and payment of the price of any Items to us will fulfil your obligation to pay the price to the Partner. Payment for all Items can be made on our Application by credit or debit card, or such other payment method made available by Deliveroo. Once your Table Service Order has been confirmed, your credit or debit card will be authorised and the total amount marked for payment. Payment is made directly to Deliveroo acting as agent on behalf of the Partner only. Payment may also be made by using vouchers or account credit. Use of these is subject to Deliveroo&#39;s Voucher and Account Credit Terms.</p><p>Partners sometimes make special offers available through our Application. These are visible when you look at a Partner menu. These offers are at the discretion of the Partners. Unless the offer terms state a fixed or minimum period for which an offer will be available, it can be withdrawn at any time, unless you have already placed an order based on the offer and we have sent the Confirmation Notice.</p><h3>11. Our Responsibility for Loss or Damage That You Suffer</h3><p>We are responsible to you for any loss or damage that you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these Terms or of failing to use reasonable care and skill in relation to your use of our Service. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is “foreseeable” if it is either obvious that it will happen, or if you told us that it might happen, for example if you tell us about particular circumstances that might increase the loss or damage arising from our breach of these Terms before you place an order.</p><p>We exclude and limit our responsibility to you for loss or damage to the fullest extent save where it would be unlawful to do so. Subject to this, we are not responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer as a result of your own breach of these Terms or as a result of any IT hardware or software failure other than a failure in our Application.  </p><h3>12. Data Protection</h3><p>We process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy which can be found <a  href="https://deliveroo.ie/privacy">here</a>.</p><h3>13. Other Terms</h3><p>If either we or you have any right to enforce these Terms against the other, that right will not be lost even if the person who has the right delays enforcing it, or waive their right to enforce it in any instance.  If a court or other authority decides that any part of these Terms is illegal or ineffective, the rest of the terms will be unaffected and will remain in force.</p><p>We may change these Terms from time to time. If we make any changes which affect your rights in relation to our Service, we will notify you. Changes to the Terms will not affect any orders you have placed where we have sent the Confirmation Notice. These Terms are governed by the laws of Ireland and you can bring legal proceedings in relation to our Service in the Irish courts.  We are required by EU law to provide <a  href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN">this link</a> to the EU’s online dispute resolution portal, however we do not participate in dispute resolution under this process.</p><h2 id="deliveroo-voucher-and-account-credit-terms">Deliveroo Voucher and Account Credit Terms</h2><h3>1. Introduction</h3><p>Deliveroo makes available from time to time: (i) <strong>Vouchers</strong> (which are promotional credits that may be offered by us or by Partner Restaurants on our Site) and (ii) <strong>Account Credit</strong> (which is credit that may be applied to a customer’s account at Deliveroo’s discretion). Vouchers and Account Credits both operate as credits applying to a customer’s Deliveroo account, redeemable (subject to conditions, as set out below) against the cost of Items. Vouchers and Account Credits are referred to collectively in these terms (the <strong>Credit Terms</strong>) as <strong>Credits</strong>.</p><p>These Credit Terms apply to your use of any Credits to pay for Items using the Deliveroo Service. These Credit Terms apply together with the Deliveroo Terms and Conditions of Service, which continue to apply unless they conflict with these Credit Terms, in which case these Credit Terms have priority. Capitalised words used in these Credit Terms have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service unless they are defined in these Credit Terms.</p><p>You can “apply” a voucher to your account by (i) entering the Voucher code (if any) at the point you place an order, or (ii) by adding any reward that we make available to you in the “Your offers and rewards” section of your account page. Unless otherwise stated, a voucher that has been applied to your account will remain there until it is “redeemed” against an eligible order, or expires (whichever is sooner).  Account Credits are Credits that we apply to your account ourselves. In either case, once any Credit has been applied to your account, the amount of the Credit remains on your account until redeemed as payment for Items, unless it is lost, or, in the case of Vouchers, it expires in accordance with the terms of that Voucher. The reasons why Credits may be lost or Vouchers may expire are set out in these Credit Terms.</p><h3>2. Terms that apply to Vouchers only</h3><p>Vouchers offered in a particular country and currency may be subject to geographical restrictions that mean they cannot be used in a different country or currency. Vouchers are usually offered subject to conditions, such as time limits, geographic limits, limits to particular categories of customer (eg new customers), or use only at a particular Partner Restaurant or for a particular menu item. If conditions apply they will be stated when we offer the Voucher.</p><p>Some Vouchers are only available to new Deliveroo customers (&quot;New Customer Vouchers&quot;). That means that the Voucher is applied (subject to any other applicable conditions) automatically when the Customer registers a new Deliveroo account and will be redeemed when the Customer places their first eligible order. Deliveroo reserves the right to refuse to apply and/or allow you to redeem a new customer Voucher if you are registering a new account using credit card details or a delivery name and address already on our system. </p><p>Use of a Voucher in payment or part-payment may also be subject to specific conditions applicable to that Voucher only, such as a specific minimum order value or that the Voucher may only be redeemed at specific Partner Restaurants or on specific Items. If the order placed does not comply with the applicable conditions, the Credit may not be redeemed against that order. The payment page on our Site where you confirm your order for Items will show the total order value and the applicable Voucher, if any. If there is a Voucher credit on your account which does not apply to your order, it will not appear on the payment page. At that point you will have the choice of paying in another way or cancelling the order.</p><p>Unless we tell you otherwise, all Vouchers must be redeemed within one calendar month of the date they are applied.</p><p>Only one Voucher can be redeemed per order. Each Voucher can only be used once per customer.  If you have more than one eligible Voucher applied to your account when you place an order, the Vouchers are redeemed in order of expiry date, with the Voucher expiring the earliest redeemed first.  </p><p>Vouchers cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other Deliveroo offer.</p><p>If you cancel an order made using a Voucher, the Voucher credit will not be restored to the account and the Voucher cannot be re-used. If the Voucher was a New Customer Voucher, you will no longer be a new customer and will not be eligible for any subsequent new customer Vouchers.</p><h3>3. Terms that apply to Vouchers and Account Credit</h3><p>Item orders are generally subject to minimum order values, which continue to apply regardless of whether payment or part-payment is by way of a Credit. </p><p>Credits cannot be exchanged for cash or any other alternatives and have no monetary value.</p><p>Any attempt to manipulate our Site and our offers of Credits by use of bulk entry via third parties or syndicates, macros, ‘script’, ‘brute force’, masking identity by manipulating IP addresses, using identities other than their own or any other automated means (including systems which can be programmed to enter), will render the order and the relevant Credit invalid. Deliveroo is entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect itself against fraudulent or invalid Credit redemptions, including requiring additional reasonable verification close the accounts of any customers it reasonably believes have carried out any such acts.</p><p></p><h2 id="deliveroo-gift-card-terms-and-conditions">Deliveroo Gift Card Terms and Conditions</h2><p><strong>Last updated: 5 April 2021</strong></p><p>This page sets out the terms that apply to Gift Cards supplied by Deliveroo Ireland Limited (“<strong>Deliveroo</strong>”), a company registered in Ireland with registered number 556923.  Our registered address is The Stone Building, 15 Flemmings Place, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, D04 P6W3.  </p><p>Please read these terms carefully before purchasing or using any Gift Card on our Service.

The email will include a unique link. Simply share your unique link with a friend or relative (aged 18 or over) who does not live at the same address as you and who you think would benefit from the Deliveroo service (a “referral”). If anyone to whom you give a referral goes on to place a Deliveroo order using that unique link, we will apply to your account the amount of Deliveroo Voucher credit stated in the email we sent to you with the unique link. It may take up to seven days after your relative of friend places a referral order before the Voucher credit is applied to your account. Voucher credits received under the Referral Program can be redeemed at any Partner Restaurant and expire automatically within the period stated in the promotional materials or other associated Deliveroo materials.</li><li>Unique links may only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. This means that you can share your unique link with your personal connections via your own social media accounts (eg your personal Facebook, Twitter or Instagram account) but not on sites where you are a contributor but not the account owner (eg Facebook business accounts or groups, Wikipedia, Google Reviews, coupon websites). Promoting your referral code via Search Engine Marketing (eg AdWords / Yahoo / Bing) is also not allowed. If we become aware that you have made your unique link available in any of these ways we may deactivate it without telling you. We will not be responsible for any losses you suffer if we deactivate your account for this reason.</li><li>We may discontinue the Referral Programme at any time. We will give advance notice of discontinuance on our Site. Voucher credit already applied to your account as a result of referrals will remain available for the period as stated in Clause 2 above, even if the Referral Programme is discontinued.</li><li>Referral credits are Vouchers and are therefore subject to the above Voucher Terms and Conditions. </li><li>You may receive Voucher credit for a maximum of 100 referrals. We reserve the right to change the maximum number of referrals for which Voucher credit is awarded at any time, though you will receive Voucher credit for any referral orders placed by your relatives or friends before the change. </li><li>The Promoter is Deliveroo Ireland Limited, 15 Flemmings Place, Dublin 4, D0 P6W3.  </li></ol><p></p><h2 id="deliveroo-plus-terms-and-conditions">Deliveroo Plus Terms and Conditions</h2><p>Last updated 13 September 2021</p><p>These T&amp;Cs apply to you if you subscribe to have a Deliveroo Plus account.
