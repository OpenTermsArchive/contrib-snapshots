<p>We process the data that you enter or upload to the Service (“Customer Data”) in accordance with this Privacy Notice and the Agreement.
Linksys will maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards consistent with industry standards, which are designed to provide security and confidentiality of your personal data.
Certain data collected from the Service, or that you provide or make accessible as part of your use of the Service, is necessary for the essential use and functionality of the Service or to provide associated services as set forth in this Privacy Notice.
These are labeled as “Required Data” under the categories of personal data below.
Accordingly, you may not be able to opt-out of certain data collection practices without terminating your use of the Service.</p>
<p>We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your personal data.
For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.
You should also be aware that names that you give your WiFi-enabled devices may be detectable by Linksys and by others, so you should not include personal data in your device names.</p> What categories of personal data does Linksys collect about you when you use the Service? <p>“Personal data” means any information relating to you.

<em>Children’s Personal Data</em>.
The Service and Linksys Products are not directed to, nor does Linksys knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16.
If we are informed that we have collected the Personal Data of a child under the age of 16, we will delete that Personal Data from our systems.
If you believe we might have inadvertently collected Personal Data from or about a child under the age of 16, please contact us at privacy@belkin.com.</p> Why does Linksys need to collect, process and use your personal data? <p>The data you provide is processed by Linksys and its service provider, for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Authentication Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you subscribe to the Service, a License ID, consisting of a unique value associated with you, is sent to Trend Micro, telling Trend Micro that you have subscribed to the Service.
This License ID then “unlocks” Linksys Shield on your Linksys Product and LSWF account to give you access to Linksys Shield for as long as you subscribe to the Service.</li>
<li>IP addresses are processed so that we know which Internet server your home network is connected to and which devices are using the Service.
This helps us to troubleshoot problems with connectivity to the Internet and helps us make sure the Service is working properly.</li>
<li> The MAC address and serial number of your Linksys Product is processed to make sure that your Linksys Product is working properly.
It also assists us with troubleshooting problems that a particular Product may have with the Service.</li>
<li>Your LSWF account data is processed as part of the authentication of the Service with your LSWF account.
This ensures that your use of the Service and any settings you create only occur within the secure environment of your LSWF account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Support Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support data is processed to quickly assess your support issue, to assist you with troubleshooting the problem with your Product or the Service and/or to process returns on your behalf.
It also enables us to notify you by email about technical notes and alerts, security issues, firmware updates and other communications relating to the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage data is processed so that we can monitor and analyze trends in order to make improvements to our Products and the Service based on how you use them.
It also enables us to provide better customer service to you by helping us identify and troubleshoot issues you may have with our Products and the Service.</li>
<li>User configuration data may include MAC addresses of devices in your home network, user defined URLs and IP addresses, as well as category blocking preferences and time schedules related to your use of the Service.
User configuration data is processed and stored at your request.
We do not collect, process or store any other information about your use of the Internet or devices in your home network.</li>
<li>User logs may include information about specific devices’ connections to specific URLs or IP address information that is relevant to the operation of the Service based on user-defined configurations.
For example, if you have blocked a specific category, and a device in your home network attempts to connect to a URL in that category, the Service will keep a log of that failed attempt.
User log data may be used during customer support to troubleshoot issues with your use of the Service.
It is not exported without your consent.</li>
</ul>What is the legal basis for processing my personal data? <p>Under the GDPR, we can only collect and use your personal data if we have a valid legal basis for doing so, and we are required to explain the various legal bases that we rely on to you.</p>
<p>One of the legal bases that we rely on to process your information is “legitimate interests”.
Where we talk about “legitimate interests” of Linksys or third parties, this can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure the Service is working properly.</li>
<li>Providing adequate security of your personal data within the Service.</li>
<li>Providing you with customer support and troubleshooting issues with your use of the Service.</li>
<li>Providing you with notifications about the Service and updates relating to the Service.</li>
<li>Making sure the Service is accessible to you and easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>When relying on the legitimate interests basis for processing your personal data, we will balance the legitimate interest pursued by us and any relevant third party with your interest and fundamental rights and freedoms in relation to the protection of your personal data to ensure it is appropriate for us to rely on legitimate interests and to identify any additional steps we need to take to achieve the right balance.</p>
<p>To help you understand, we have set out each of the reasons why we collect and use your personal data, i.e.
the Processing Purposes, and mapped these against the different legal bases that allow us to do so.

</ol>With whom might Linksys share my personal data? <p>Linksys is part of the Belkin group of companies (“Belkin Group”).
In addition, the Belkin Group is owned by Foxconn Interconnect Technology, a Hon Hai company, which includes companies in the Foxconn group of companies (“FIT Group”).
To ensure that the Processing Purposes can be completed, your information may be shared with any of the entities within the Belkin Group and FIT Group network.
When we do share data in this way, however, it is our policy to limit the categories of individuals who have access to that personal information.
Also, as noted in the Linksys Privacy Policy, we do not rent or sell personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Linksys may transfer personal data to third parties, including to entities within and outside the Belkin Group and FIT Group located in any jurisdictions where Belkin Group and FIT Group entities are located, for the Processing Purposes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To companies within the Belkin Group and FIT Group.</li>
<li>To third party service providers.
As necessary to provide the Service to you.
Below is a list of third party service providers that we may share your data with: <ul>
<li>Trend Micro Incorporated (see separate Trend Micro privacy policy)</li>
<li>Splunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To customer support service providers.
As necessary to provide you with customer support if you contact our customer support team: <ul>
<li>Concentrix</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Sutherland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To regulators, authorities, and other third parties.
As necessary for the Processing Purposes described above, personal information may be transferred to regulators, courts, and other authorities (e.g., tax and law enforcement authorities), independent external advisors (e.g., auditors), internal compliance and investigation teams (including external advisers appointed to conduct internal investigations).</li>
<li>To acquiring entities.
Your personal data may be transferred to third parties involved in a reorganisation, restructuring, merger, acquisition or transfer of assets of the Linksys business in whole or in part, including the successor entity, provided that the receiving party agrees to treat your personal data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, we may share aggregated anonymized information, including non-personal usage data, with third parties for a variety of purposes, including to analyze trends about home networking and utility use, to show third parties how their products could work with Linksys products and to generally improve home networking.
We've taken steps to ensure that this information cannot be linked back to you and we require third parties to keep all shared information in its anonymized form.</p> Where might Linksys transfer my personal data? <p>Linksys will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, various locations globally, including the United States, other countries located outside the EEA or if you are in Australia or New Zealand (“ANZ”), outside of ANZ.
Some countries where recipients may be located already provide an adequate level of protection for this data (e.g.
Canada), and transfers to other countries such as the United States may be protected under arrangements such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.
For transfers to Belkin Group entities outside of the EEA and certain service providers both where located in other countries without adequate protections for personal data, Linksys will be bound by the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (available here) pursuant to Article 46(2)(c) GDPR, which the European Commission has assessed as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, to ensure that your data is protected adequately.</p>
<p>By providing your personal data to us, you fully understand that Linksys may transfer, process and store your personal data outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different, and may disclose your personal data to overseas service providers who may not fully comply with the particular laws of your country.</p> How does Linksys keep my personal data secure? <p>	Linksys and its data processors maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal data against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, and access, including but not limited to encrypting personal data in transit, secure transmission and storage of personal data, authentication and access control mechanisms, proper backup and restoration of personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident and making sure that data centers that store your personal data comply with industry standard security controls.
We also regularly test our systems to evaluate the effectiveness of our security measures on an ongoing basis.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure.
If you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted personal data.
If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.</p> How long will Linksys keep my personal data? <p>It is our policy not to keep personal data longer than is necessary for the purpose for which that data was collected and to the extent permitted by applicable laws.
We may, for example, keep your personal data for a reasonable time after you have stopped using the Service to ensure that Linksys has the records it needs in the event of a dispute or regulatory investigation and to ensure that any ongoing obligations can be complied with, such as complying with requests from regulators.
Where personal data is kept, that period will be determined based on the applicable local law.</p> What rights do I have in respect of my personal data? <p>You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data.
These can differ by country.
If you are located in the EEA, you have the following rights: </p>
<p>
<strong>(i)	Right of access</strong> – You have the right to confirm with us whether your personal data is processed, and if it is, to request access to that personal data including the categories of personal data processed, the purpose of the processing and the recipients or categories of recipients.
We do have to take into account the interests of others though, so this is not an absolute right, and if you want to request more than one copy of your personal data we may charge a fee.</p>
<p>
<strong>(ii)	Right to rectification</strong> – You have the right to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data concerning you.</p>
<p>
<strong>(iii)	Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)</strong> – You may have the right to ask us to erase personal data concerning you.</p>
<p>
<strong>(iv)	Right to restriction of processing</strong> – You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data where you believe such data to be inaccurate, where our processing is unlawful, or where we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(v)	Right to data portability</strong> – You may have the right to receive personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you may have the right to transmit that data to another entity.</p>
<p>
<strong>(vi)	Right to object</strong> – You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data, where the justification for our processing is our legitimate interest.
We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>(vii) Right to withdraw consent</strong> – You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data at any time after you have consented, including opting out of receiving marketing materials.
The easiest way to do this is by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in any email you receive from us.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as stated below <strong>(How do I contact you about my privacy rights?)</strong>
</p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority, which may vary depending on your location.
