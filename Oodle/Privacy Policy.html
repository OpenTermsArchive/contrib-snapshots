Oodle allows certain third parties to set and access their own cookies, use their own web beacons and use their own scripts on and through the Sites.
How other companies use their own cookies, web beacons and scripts and the information they gather is subject to those companies' own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.
Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards.
You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members here.
