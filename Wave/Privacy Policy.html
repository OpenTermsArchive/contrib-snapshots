wave.ac Privacy Policy<p>Effective as of 8 June 2018</p>
<p>At wave.ac, we emphasize giving you the best user experience and having confidence in your use of the service.
Our Privacy Policy is a reflection of these goals.</p>
<p>As with our other Agreements, our Privacy Policy is subject to change at anytime.
Should we decide to change it, we will make prominent notice of these changes when we make amendments that require your attention.</p>Data Collection<p>We may collect certain data about or from you during your usage of the Service.
Details about the categories of data that we collect are listed below.</p>Profile Data<p>We collect very limited data—namely your email, username, location, and other applicable data you supply to us when you sign up or activate a beta invitation.
We also may store passwords for some users for the purpose of authenticating to the Service.
These passwords are hashed and stored securely in our database in order to increase the security of your account and data.
We are unable to view your account password after it has been stored in the database.
This information can be set, added, changed, or deleted using our Service, and is directly provided to us by you.
You are under no obligation to provide us with personal information of any kind, however your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the Service.</p>Derivative Data<p>Other forms of data we collect are related to your geographical location, which may be fetched using your IP address so we can offer you a better service by delivering content to you using our CDN.
Further details related to your request, like your web browser, operating system, and pages you are directed to the Service from, may be collected automatically by our servers.</p>Usage Data<p>We may collect information on your usage of our Service, such as profiles you visit, tracks you play, and more as a result of your usage of the Service, in order to operate certain features of our service such as analytics for artists.
In addition, we collect and store direct usage data relating to your interactions on the Service, such as messages, comments, likes of tracks and playlists, the contents of playlists, users you follow, and more.
This data is collected in order to provide basic components of the Service like your library and stream.</p>Financial Data<p>Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g.
valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) may be collected when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or request information about our products using the Service.
We store only very limited, if any, financial information we collect.
Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our third party payment processor, Stripe, and you are binded by their privacy policy and Agreements.</p>
<p>Beyond these aforementioned forms and your User Content, we do not collect any personal data on you.
However, we might build systems in the future that could use your Usage Data and Profile Data to make better music recommendations, suggestions for building your audience, making more successful social media campaigns, customizing your pages or profile, and so on and so forth.
If and when these systems are put into place, we will update this policy to clarify how your data is used.
All-in-all, we will make use of this information and data you provide to us to optimize your experience.</p>Data Usage<p>We may use the data we collect in order to provide access to the components of the Service for you and other users, to email or contact you in relation to your account, to fulfill payments and purchases, to compile and analyze anonymous statistical data, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems, to respond to customer service requests, and to assist law enforcement or respond to subpoenas if legally required.</p>
<p>Your information may be disclosed to other parties in the following scenarios:</p>
<p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including but not limited to payment processing, data analysis, and email delivery.</p>
<p>We may share your information with investors, generally in anonymized and aggregate form, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
We may also share your information with such third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.</p>
<p>If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity.
If we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations.
If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.</p>Data Security<p>Despite our low-index of information, we take securing your information especially seriously.
We utilize appropriate technical measures to keep personal information and data on our users safe.
That said, the most likely way a user could compromise your data is by using your password—and so we encourage you to make one that is unique and strong, and keep it safe.</p>Cookies<p>Cookies and other local browser storage technologies may be used on the Service for the purpose of providing authentication functionality.
We do not use cookies to track you or provide analytics information or in any way outside of the purpose of providing data about login sessions to our servers.</p>Third-Party Websites<p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest that are not affiliated with us.
These links may exist in places such as user profiles and track metadata.
Once you have used these links to leave the Service, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.
Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Service.</p>Your Personal Data Rights<p>As noted in our Privacy Policy, we collect a low-index of information on our users.
Most of this data is provided to us by the end-user, and we expect this data to be accurate.
Built into our Service is the ability to access your personal data and change, update, or delete that data.
However, you can also request deletion and erasure of your data via email.
To contact us regarding your rights, please email us at info@wave.ac.</p>
