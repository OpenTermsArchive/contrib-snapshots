<p>Thank you for using Instacart! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Instacart services, including Instacart’s website, Instacart’s mobile applications, APIs, and any websites (or portions thereof) or mobile applications that are operated by Instacart (collectively, the “Services”), and are entered into by you and Maplebear Inc. (d/b/a Instacart), a Delaware corporation (“Instacart”). This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Services (each, hereafter, a “user”).</p>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge and agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with Instacart’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>SECTION 13 (“DISPUTES &amp; ARBITRATION”) OF THESE TERMS (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU AND INSTACART HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST INSTACART ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 13 FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND HOW TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>The Services comprise a technology platform that presents you with a set of one or more retailer (each a “Retailer”) virtual storefronts from which you can select goods for picking and packing by one or more personal shoppers and delivery to your location or, if available, for you to pick up in-store. Depending on the Retailer from whom you purchase goods through the Services, picking and packing, and delivery services may be performed by third parties, which may include Retailer personnel, independent contractors, and third party logistics providers (collectively, “Third Party Providers”).</p>
<p>You acknowledge that services provided by Third Party Providers are provided by third-party independent contractors who are not employed by Instacart. You acknowledge that Instacart does not supervise, direct, or control the performance of services provided by Third Party Providers to you or for your benefit.</p>
<p>When you use the Services to place an order for goods, you authorize the purchase of those goods from the Retailers you select and, if you have selected delivery services, the delivery of those goods by Third Party Providers. Unless otherwise specified, you acknowledge and agree that Instacart and the Third Party Provider are collectively acting as your agents in the ordering, picking, packing, and/or delivery of goods purchased by you and the Retailer—not the Third Party Provider and not Instacart—is the seller of the goods to you. You agree that your purchase is being made from the Retailer you have selected, that Retailer is the merchant of record, and that title to any goods passes to you when they are purchased at the applicable Retailer’s store. You agree that Instacart or the applicable retailer will obtain a credit card authorization for your credit card on file with Instacart to cover the cost of the goods you have purchased from the retailer and any separate Instacart fees, and your card will be charged for the goods purchased by you and any applicable fees, taxes and/or tips.</p>
<p>Instacart may change the fees it charges for the Services, including but not limited to delivery fees, service fees, alcohol service fees, and heavy order fees. Your card will be temporarily authorized for an amount greater than the total amount of the purchase appearing in the original check out. This higher authorized amount will be disclosed during the purchase process and is a temporary authorization charge on your order, to deal with situations where your total purchase amount turns out to be higher than the original amount due to special requests, added items, replacement items or weight adjustments. Retailers set the prices of the goods on the Services, and some Retailers may set prices for goods on the Services that are different than in-store prices. You can view each Retailer’s pricing policies on their storefront on both the website and in the Instacart app.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided for otherwise in these Terms or a separate agreement between you and Instacart, Instacart does not form any employment or agency relationship with you and does not hold title to any goods that you order through the Services.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all prices and other amounts are in the currency of the jurisdiction where the delivery takes place.</p>
<p>Occasionally there may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to pricing, product descriptions, promotional offers, and product availability. Instacart reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or refuse or cancel orders if any information on the Services is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order and/or your credit card has been charged).</p>

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services. Unless such restriction is prohibited by law or you have Instacart’s written permission, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the Services. You may only access the Services through the interfaces that Instacart provides for that purpose (for example, you may not “scrape” the Services through automated means or “frame” any part of the Services), and you may not interfere or attempt to disrupt the Services.</p>
<p>Some parts of the Services may allow you to upload or submit content (such as text, images, video, recipes, lists, links, and other materials). You retain all rights in any content that you upload or submit, and are solely responsible for that content.

<p>You may have the option of accessing the Services through downloadable software and this software may update itself automatically on your device. Some software, or portions of software, in the Services may be governed by open source licenses. In that case, Instacart will make such licenses available to you and, in the case of conflict between such a license and these Terms, the open source license will control but only with respect to the software, or portion of the software, to which it applies.</p>
<p>If you are using Instacart Services for its intended purposes on behalf of a business or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms and that you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that business or entity.</p>

2. Instacart Communications
</h2>
<div class="constrain-width">
<p>By creating an Instacart user account, you agree to accept and receive communications from Instacart or Third Party Providers, including via email, text message, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provided to Instacart. You understand and agree that you may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded messages sent by or on behalf of Instacart, its affiliated companies and/or Third Party Providers, including but not limited to communications concerning orders placed through your account on the Services. Message and data rates may apply. If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, text messages, or other communications, you may opt out of such communications at any time in Your Account Settings. You may also opt-out of receiving text messages from Instacart by replying “STOP” from the mobile device receiving the messages.</p>
<p>If you use the Services to order a prescription drug product (where available), you understand and agree that user inquiries must be conducted via telephone. You also understand and agree that a third party pharmacy and/or Instacart may send you unencrypted SMS messages, push notifications or other electronic notifications relating to prescription drug products that you order through the Services. There is some level of risk that information in such communications could be read by an unintended third party. By using the Services to order a prescription drug product, you explicitly disclaim any liability against Instacart, its affliated companies, and Third Party Providers for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any SMS messages, push notifications and/or other electronic notifications.</p>

3. Instacart Express
</h2>
<div class="constrain-width">
<p>Instacart Express is a membership program that waives the delivery fee and reduces certain service fees for scheduled deliveries on orders over $35  (the "Instacart Express Benefits") with each Retailer placed through the Services for a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Instacart Express Benefits may differ on certain Retailer's white label sites that are powered by Instacart. Generally, Instacart gift cards and/or credits cannot be used to pay for the Instacart Express subscription fee. Deliveries made by Third Party Providers via Instacart Express are subject to availability. You acknowledge that your Instacart Express membership does not entitle you to faster delivery times or priority time slots. Service fees, alcohol service fees, heavy order fees, special handling fees, taxes and/or tips may still apply. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>UNLESS YOU CANCEL, BY DEFAULT (AND WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), YOUR INSTACART EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL WITH AN ACTIVE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ON FILE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. The billing date will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you sign-up for an Instacart Express membership (monthly or yearly) and will be charged on the billing date indicated on your “Your Account” page. In certain circumstances, your billing date may change. For instance, if we are unable to successfully charge your card for the Instacart Express membership fee on a given day (e.g., a Federal holiday or technical failures). Instacart Express membership fees are fully earned upon payment.</p>
<p>If your payment details change, your card provider may provide us with updated card details. We may use these new details or details from other cards on file in order to help prevent any interruption to your Instacart Express membership. If you do not want to have your card automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank. If you would like to use a different payment method or if there is a change in payment method, please update your billing information on your “Your Account” page under the “Express” section. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate and you represent that you are authorized to use the card in the manner contemplated here. If the card you provided to us for payment is declined or if a payment was not successfully made by you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully made and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the Services, including without limitation your Instacart Express membership, until we have successfully charged a valid credit or debit card.</p>
<p>If you do not want your membership to automatically renew, you can cancel your Instacart Express membership at any time using this <a href="https://www.instacart.com/store/subscriptions/express_churn_steps">link</a> or on your “Your Account” page under the <a href="https://www.instacart.com/store/subscriptions/account">Express</a> section. You may cancel your Instacart Express membership within the first fifteen (15) calendar days of your paid Instacart Express membership term and receive a refund of the Instacart Express membership fee you paid, but only if you have not placed any orders using your Instacart Express membership. If you cancel at any other time, you will not receive a refund, but you can continue to enjoy the benefits of your Instacart Express membership through the end of your paid membership term. Additional instructions on how to manage your Instacart Express membership are available in the Help Center.</p>
<p>From time to time, Instacart offers some users trial or other promotional memberships to Instacart Express. Such trial or promotional memberships are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer, including which users are eligible for the promotional memberships. Only one trial or promotional membership is available per household and may not be combined with any other promotion. When the free trial or promotional membership period has expired, Instacart will automatically charge you the applicable Instacart membership fee to the credit or debit card on file with Instacart. If you cancel your Instacart Express membership before the free trial or promotional membership period has expired, Instacart will not charge you for the subsequent Instacart Express membership term. Instacart may change the monthly or annual fee charged for Instacart Express membership at any time, but any such fee change will not apply to current Instacart Express members until such time as their current memberships expire and their memberships are renewed for another term.</p>
<p>We may change other terms or conditions applicable to Instacart Express from time to time. Any new or renewed Instacart Express memberships will be subject to the terms of service active at that time and displayed when you sign up for Instacart Express. Instacart may also make such changes with respect to current Instacart Express memberships. In that case, Instacart will provide you with notice at checkout of the changes and when those changes will take effect. If you disagree with the changes to your current Instacart Express membership terms of service, you may cancel your Instacart Express membership.</p>
<p>Your Instacart Express membership cannot be transferred or assigned. Instacart reserves the right to accept, refuse, or cancel your Instacart Express membership at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

</h2>
<div class="constrain-width">
<p>This Section 13 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Instacart that arises out of or relates to: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services, including any goods or services purchased or sold through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Instacart as a consumer.</p>
<p>Before initiating proceedings against Instacart, you agree to contact Instacart first and attempt to work out any such dispute amicably.</p>
<p>
</p><h3 class="accessible">For residents of the United States, you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mandatory Arbitration: If we’re unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Instacart agree to resolve through binding arbitration, rather than in court, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising at any time out of or relating to: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Services, including any goods or services purchased or sold through, by, or using the Services; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Instacart as a consumer.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this mandatory arbitration provision, (a) you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and (b) you and Instacart each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement of a party’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of these Terms.</p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.  If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of the claimant’s state of residence.</p>
<p><b>TRIAL BY JURY WAIVER:</b> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p><b>CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER:</b> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN, EITHER AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER, IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU AND INSTACART OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, ANY ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN YOUR FAVOR AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), AND ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER INSTACART USERS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>Opt-out of Mandatory Arbitration: You can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing Instacart at <a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@instacart.com">arbitration-opt-out@instacart.com</a> with your first and last name and the email address associated with your account and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>
<p><b>Except as described below for California residents,</b> the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made. The Rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply.</p>
<p>The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) selected in accordance with the Rules. The Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart. The Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual. The Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The Arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart.</p>
<p>You and Instacart agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or use the Services, or a location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Instacart submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Rules.</p>
<p>The Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”) and each party will be responsible for their own Arbitration Fees under those Rules or to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><b>For California residents,</b> the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) under its Arbitration Rules (the “ADR Services Rules”) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made.  The ADR Services Rules are available at: https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules/.  In the event of any conflict between the ADR Services Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply.</p>
<p>For California residents, the Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the ADR Services Rules (the “ADR Arbitrator”).  The ADR Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart. The ADR Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual. The ADR Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The ADR Arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart.</p>
<p>For California residents, you and Instacart agree that the ADR Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The ADR Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>
<p>For California residents, the arbitration will be held in the California county where you live or use the Services, San Francisco, California, or any other location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing.</p>
<p>For California residents, the ADR Services Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees (“ADR Services Arbitration Fees”), but in no event will you be responsible for any portion of those fees in excess of the initial filing fee. After you pay your portion of any initial filing fee, Instacart shall pay any remaining costs and expenses unique to arbitration, including, without limitation, the arbitrator’s fees and any ADR Services administrative or case management expenses.</p>
<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class, Collective, Representative Action Waiver above is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
