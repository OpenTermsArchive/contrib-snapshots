</p> INFORMATION WE COLLECT <p>
<br>You can visit the Site to read about our vehicles or use our online tools without providing any Personally Identifiable Information (other than, in some cases, your zip code).
You may also choose to participate in activities and obtain services on the Site for which we may collect Personally Identifiable Information.
We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information automatically when you use the Site.
<br>
<br>
<b>“Personally Identifiable Information”</b> is information associated with or that may be used to identify or contact a specific person.
Personally Identifiable Information includes: (1) contact data (name, address, city, state, zip code, email address and telephone number).
(2) demographic data (such as age range, gender, birth month).
(3) vehicle information (vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model, model year, selling dealer and date of purchase or lease).
and (4) credit card number and payment card information.<br>
<br>
<b>“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”</b> is information that, by itself, does not identify the individual, such as the operating system you are using, IP address, the date and time stamp of your visit, referring URLs, your Internet service provider, browser type and related browser data, the pages you visit and purchase history.
<br>
<br>
</p> HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED <p>
<br>
<b>Information You Provide To Us</b>
<br>
<br> We collect information that you provide to us when you use the Site.
The information that we collect and how we process it depends on how you use the Site.

<ul>
<li>When you register or create an account</li>

<p>
<br>
<b>Information We Collect Automatically</b>
<br>
<br> We also collect certain information from users of the Site automatically when they visit.
We may collect such information in the following ways:<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies.
</b>
<br>
<br> We may collect certain preference information of website users through the use of cookies, including flash cookies, which are small files stored on your hard drive in order to optimize the design of the Site.
Our “cookies” are only used when you are visiting the Site.
Cookies enable us to track and aggregate user behavior data so that we may better target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on the Site.
You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
<br>
<br>
<b>Web Analytics and Other Technologies.
</b>
<br>
<br> A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line.
Hyundai may employ a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers.
Many of these technologies are provided to Hyundai via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior.
In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.
For example, we may use Adobe Omniture and Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site.
The Google Analytics tool uses cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including IP address) is transmitted to Google.
This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Site and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Hyundai.
For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google’s website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.<br>
<br>
<b>Web Beacons.
</b>
<br>
<br> Some of our web pages, promotional email messages and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel GIFs.
Web beacons collect information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.
Web beacons are a technique we may use to enhance and personalize the Site and the products and Services we offer, to provide product information and advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, compile aggregated statistics about the usage of the Site and to track the number of users who have opened and acted upon our promotional email messages.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Third Party Advertisers.
</b>
<br>
<br> Some banner ads provided by third parties may be displayed on the Site.
These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons.
Unlike cookies and web beacons used by Hyundai in content it controls on the Site, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information.
We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within the Site and they may use information (not including Personally Identifiable Information) about your visits to the Site and other websites to assist in serving advertisements to you.
These companies may employ cookies, web beacons and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness.
They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date and time the banner ad was shown you, the specific ad shown and the IP address.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files.
</b>
<br>
<br> Like most websites, we collect log information to analyze trends, administer the sites, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in improving the sites.
IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Information We Obtain From Other Sources</b>
<br>
<br> Hyundai may also obtain information about you and your vehicle in a number of other ways.
For example, we may obtain information about you or your vehicle when you provide it to us at an event such as an auto show, from business reply cards, sweepstakes entries, test-drive incentive applications, surveys, vehicle sales records and other public sources.

We use this information to serve your needs through better customer service and to advise you of our products and services.</p> HOW WE USE INFORMATION <p>

</b>
<br>
<br> Hyundai may share Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including website user or vehicle owner information with third parties including our service providers, affiliates, authorized dealers, licensees, suppliers and marketing partners so that they can provide services on our behalf (e.g., brochure fulfillment), show you advertisements about our products and services on their third party sites or so they may use it to offer you other valuable products and services.

We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties other than these without your permission.
<br>
<br>
<b>Programs.
</b>
<br>
<br> Hyundai may invite you to participate in promotional activities, such as surveys, sweepstakes, contests, special events, blogs and chats (<b>“Programs”</b>).
These Programs are oftentimes co-marketed with an unaffiliated Hyundai business partner.
If you participate in a Program, we may use Personally Identifiable Information you provide.
For example, we may send you email messages to invite you to join a contest Program.
Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company.
If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this Privacy Policy will not apply to that company’s use of your information.
Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program.
If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Privacy Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern.
Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us (or our business partners) with any Personally Identifiable Information.<br>

<br>
<br> Some of our websites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors.
On websites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we may also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank.
