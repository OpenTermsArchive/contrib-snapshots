We may also contact you regarding a Web site problem or other customer service-related issues.</p>

If you are a registered user, this information is stored with your registration information.
It is unique-number identifiable, and is used solely for purposes of enabling us to provide you with a personalized Web site experience.

<br>
<br> This same data is also used by Gartner clients to help them understand how their subscriptions are being used by their employees and in this case, is personally identifiable to the specific client.

<strong>Cookies</strong>
<br> A cookie is a small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to "identify" visitors.
Each time you initiate a session on Gartner Web sites, a cookie is set in order to identify you and determine your access privileges.
Cookies do not store any of the information that you have provided to the site.
They are simply identifiers. 
<br>
<br> You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time.
However, you should know that cookies may be necessary to provide you with access to much of the content and many of the features of Gartner Web sites.
We use cookie technology to enable registered users to move quickly and securely through access-controlled areas of the sites.
Cookie technology also enables registered users to take advantage of certain useful features on the sites, including "remember my password."

Confidential personal information sent to us is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer technology.
This information is then encrypted in our secure database.
The database is further protected behind a firewall.
If you have any questions about the security at our Web sites, please send an e-mail to  security.officer@gartner.com.
