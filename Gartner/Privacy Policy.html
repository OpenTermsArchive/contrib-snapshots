<p>
<strong>Utilization Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We may share information with our organizational clients about how their employees use the sites and the resources available to them through the sites (e.g., how employees used certain features of the sites, utilization trends, which features were most popular with the client’s employees).</p> 3.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS <p>Gartner is a global company and we may transfer personal information to other Gartner group companies or suppliers outside your country.
Gartner will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>Gartner may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Policy on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.</p>
<p>The countries to which we transfer data outside of the EEA may include any of the countries in which Gartner does business.
A list of Gartner office locations can be found here.</p>
<p>All Gartner entities have signed an Intragroup Agreement containing the European Union (“EU”) Commission Approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area.
All Gartner entities have the same technical, physical, and administrative security controls and are required to comply with our data protection policies and procedures, applicable laws, and the terms of our client and member contracts governing the collection and use of information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Shield.
</strong> Gartner complies with the EU-US and US-Swiss Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of information from European Union member countries, and is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.
Gartner adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Policy, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. </p>
<p>Gartner’s accountability for information that we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.
In particular, we remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process the information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>More information about the Privacy Shield program can be found at https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p> 4.
RETENTION PERIODS <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations require us to retain it.  </p>
<p>In general terms, this will mean that your personal information will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:</p>
<ul>
<li>the period required by tax and company laws and regulations.
and</li>
<li>as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims.
This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws. </li>
</ul> 5.
CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION <p>We believe it is important to give you choices about the use of your information.
We will use your information as described in this Policy (or any other conference- or service-specific Privacy Policy).
If we want to use your information for a purpose not described in this Policy, we will first get your consent to do so.<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marketing Communications</strong>
<u>
<strong>
</strong>

<p>We will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications.
You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address here.
If you gave us your email address to receive marketing communications, you can opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions included at the bottom of our emails.
Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any opt-out request.
We will <u>not</u> sell or share your information or information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.<strong>

<strong>Gartner Everywhere</strong>
<u>
<strong>
</strong>
</u>
</p>
<p>Gartner Everywhere is an extension for Google Chrome that allows clients to customize their Gartner experience by providing them with Gartner research applicable to the websites they are browsing in real-time via an easy to access pop-up in their browser.
You can easily disable the extension and its collection of URLs by doing the following:<strong>

<p>
<strong>Conferences</strong>
</p>
<p>When you attend one of our conferences, you may be issued a conference badge with an RFID chip, which has a unique identifier that can be scanned from various distances.
We may use the RFID information to administer and improve the conference experience and solicit feedback and/or interest in Gartner products and services.
We will <u>not</u> sell or share RFID information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates) for their own marketing and promotional purposes.  You may request a non-RFID enabled badge by asking conferences staff at the registration desk.</p>
<p>We allow Exhibitors to scan attendee badges at our conferences.
If you choose to allow an Exhibitor to scan your badge at the Exhibitor’s booth or when entering an Exhibitor session or function, you are giving us your consent to provide your contact details to that Exhibitor.
Our Exhibitors’ use of any information you choose to share with them in this way is governed by each Exhibitor’s Privacy Policy.
Badge scanning is <strong>
<u>optional</u>
</strong>and you may refuse to have your badge scanned by the Exhibitor.</p>

If you want to opt-out from receiving  marketing communications, the best way to do so is to allow us to retain your information with a “do not contact” tag so we know not to contact you in the future. </p>
<p>There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal information is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to object to processing of your personal information</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>You may object to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You may also object to processing of your personal information in cases where we have used legitimate interests as the basis for processing.
In such cases, we will stop processing your personal information until we verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to data portability </strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>In most cases, you have the right to receive all personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you object to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to complain to the data protection authority (“DPA”) in the country where you reside, where you work, or where the alleged infringement of data protection laws has taken place.</p>
<p>We agree that any disputes regarding our privacy policies and related actions regarding personal information from data subjects in the EU can be heard by a DPA and we will be subject to the determination of those bodies (as further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles).
Please contact us to be directed to the relevant DPA.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances after they have first tried to resolve the dispute directly with us and with the DPA, data subjects in the EU may be able to invoke binding arbitration of disputes by the Privacy Shield arbitration panel.</p> 7.
SECURITY <p>We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access.
Despite these measures, no data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit via our websites or apps.
Please note that you are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials used to access any Gartner service or account, and you must report suspected unauthorized activity to us.<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We make reasonable efforts to restrict access to information to only those employees, contractors, and agents who need such access in order to operate, develop, improve, or deliver our programs, products, and services.</p> 8.
