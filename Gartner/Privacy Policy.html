<ul>
<li>to Gartner group companies in order to process the data for the above mentioned purposes;</li>

auditors and lawyers) or venues for our events;</li>
<li>To comply with applicable laws, protect rights, safety and property, and respond to lawful requests from public authorities (such as disclosing data in appropriate situations for national security or law enforcement purposes);</li>

</ul>
<p>Your personal information may be shared if we anonymize and/or aggregate it, as in these circumstances the information will cease to be personal information.<br>
</p> 3.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS <p>Gartner is a global company and, as such, we may transfer personal information to other Gartner group companies or suppliers outside your home jurisdiction.
Gartner will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>Gartner may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Notice on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.</p>
<p>The countries to which we transfer data outside of the EEA may include any of the countries in which Gartner does business.
A list of Gartner office locations can be found here.</p>
<p>If we need to transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will take steps to make sure your personal data is protected and safeguarded once it leaves the EEA, in particular the use of Model Clauses approved by the European Commission.
You may request details of such safeguards by contacting us.</p> 4.
RETENTION PERIODS <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations mandate that we retain your personal information.  We may also retain personal information for the period during which a claim may be made in relation to our dealings with you.  </p>
<p>In general terms, this will mean that your personal data will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:</p>
<ul>
<li>the period required by tax and company laws and regulations.
and</li>
<li>as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims.
This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws.    <br>
</li>
</ul> 5.
CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION <p>We believe it is important to give you choices about the use of your information.
We will use your information as described in this Notice (or any other event- or service-specific Privacy Policy).
If we want to use your information for a purpose not described in this Notice, we will first get your consent to do so.</p>
<p>
<u>Marketing Communications</u>
</p>
<p>We will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications.
You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address here .
If you gave us your email address to receive marketing communications, you can opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions included at the bottom of our emails.
Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any opt-out request.
We will <u>not</u> sell or share your information or information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>
<u>Gartner Everywhere</u>
</p>
<p>Gartner Everywhere is an extension for Google Chrome that allows clients to customize their Gartner experience by providing them with Gartner research applicable to the websites they are browsing in real-time via an easy to access pop-up in their browser.
You can easily disable the extension and its collection of URLs by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the extension Gartner Everywhere button on the top of the browser window.</li>
<li>Click the green toggle button to switch off.</li>
<li>Select the duration that you would like to switch off the extension for.</li>
<li>The extension will be automatically activated after the selected time period.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u>Events</u>
</p>
<p>When you attend one of our events, you may be issued an events badge with an RFID chip, which has a unique identifier that can be scanned from various distances.
If you select an RFID-enabled badge, we may use it to track your location around our event sites so we can better understand your areas of interest.
If you do not want us to track your location, you may obtain a non-RFID enabled badge by asking Events staff at the registration desk.</p>
<p>You may choose to share your contact details with our event sponsors by allowing them to scan your event badge.
Our sponsors’ use of any information you choose to share with them in this way is governed by each sponsor’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<u>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</u>
</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
We do not recognize or respond to browser-related DNT signals, as the industry is currently working toward a common approach to responding to DNT.

DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS <p>You have certain rights, in certain circumstances, in relation to your personal information.
A summary of each right and how an individual can take steps to exercise it is set out below.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us for additional information.
Such requests should include appropriate identity verification information (such as your name, address, email address or other information reasonably required).</p>
<p>Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we shall provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.
This may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example where requests are complex or numerous.</p>
<p>The information will be provided free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.
In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request.
We will advise you of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.</p>
<p>We may ask for additional information to verify your identity before carrying out a request.</p>
<p>Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform you without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.    <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How you can exercise the right</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to access and/or correct your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, as well as to be provided with a copy of the information (in most circumstances).
You also have the right to correct any information we may hold about you that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to restrict use of your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal data where one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The processing is unlawful but you want us to restrict use of the data instead of deleting it;</li>
<li>Where you contest the accuracy of your personal data, the restriction will apply until we have verified the accuracy or corrected your personal data;</li>
<li>We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still require us to keep it in connection with a legal claim;</li>
<li>You have exercised your right to object to the processing.
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Right to request deletion of your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in most circumstances.
Please note that if you want us to refrain from sending you marketing communications, the best way to ensure that is to allow us to retain your information with a “do not contact” tag so we know not to contact you in the future.</p>
<p>There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Right to object to processing of your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>You may object to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You may also object to processing of your personal data in cases where we have used legitimate interests as the basis for processing.
In such cases, we will stop processing your personal data until we verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to data portability </strong>
</p>
<p>In most cases, you have the right to receive all personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</strong>
</p>
<p>If you object to our processing of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the data protection authority in the country where you reside, where you work, or where an alleged infringement of data protection laws has taken place.</p>
<p> </p> 7.
SECURITY <p>We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access.
Despite these measures, no data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit via our websites or apps.</p>
<p>We make efforts to restrict access to information to only those employees, contractors, and agents who need such access in order to operate, develop, improve, or deliver our programs, products, and services.</p>
<p>Please note that you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your credentials used to access any account or service with Gartner, and you must report suspected unauthorized activity to us. You are responsible for activity conducted with your credentials.</p> 8.
