It’s important to us that you understand how the Service works with respect to collection and use of Personal Information and the ramifications on our privacy policies.</p>
<p>For those who download the Spiceworks Desktop application (“Desktop”), it is designed to make it easy to inventory and monitor the hardware and software on your network.
This “inventory data” is limited to systems related information about your network devices and how they are configured.
It does not include any non-systems related information such as personal files and content, application specific data files and content, common user directories or other user data and documents.
This Inventory Data is stored locally in a file on your computer in an encoded format.
Access to this file is password protected using the standard operating systems access control mechanisms.
In a standard Windows installation, you can find this file and its contents located at C:/Program Files/Spiceworks/db/spiceworks.db.</p> Your Privacy is Not for Sale <p>Simply put, we do not and will not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone, for any reason.
Spiceworks uses and discloses your Personal Information only as follows:</p>

and</li>

</ul>
<br>Why We Collect Information <p>We collect information because it helps us deliver the absolute best user experience we possibly can.
It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help, by customizing your experience to your unique environment.
Gathering this information enables us to connect you with other IT professionals like yourself, provide you with convenient and accurate information about discussion topics you may be interested in, and bring you timely and relevant information about the IT products and services that you may need.
In addition, this information helps us keep you informed on the latest product and service announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion.
Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time, optimizing the Service based on your feedback and how you actually use the Service.</p> What Information We Collect <p>
<strong>Account Information.</strong> When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for Personal Information such as your name, email address, company name and zip code.</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Networking Site Information.</strong> For your convenience, we may allow you to register to join Spiceworks by using log in credentials from third-party social networking sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook and LinkedIn.
If you register via an SNS, the SNS may provide us with some of the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS.</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Information.</strong> We also collect Personal Information you provide when completing the sections of your Spiceworks profile, a project page or a profile page that request Personal Information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Payment Information.</strong> If you elect to use paid features of the Service, you may need to provide Personal Information to our third-party payment processors, such as your credit card number.</p>
<p>
<strong>Customer Support.</strong> We may collect Personal Information through your communications with our customer support team.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Information.</strong> We also collect some information from you when you use the Service that does not constitute “Personal Information.” For example, each installed copy of the Desktop includes a unique application number.
If you install the Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks.
Also, when the Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks.
The unique application number is required for the Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.
From time to time, the Desktop also collects anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment.
This information is anonymized and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable company or user.
We also collect information you input into the any Web-based Offerings made available by Spiceworks in connection with your use of those offerings.</p>
<p>
<strong>User Contributions.</strong> You also may provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the Site, or transmitted to other users of the Site or third parties.
Spiceworks is not responsible for the privacy practices of the other users or third parties who may view and use that information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Automatic Data Collection.</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically from your browser and store it in log files.
This information includes display size, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and various click-stream data.
If your browser has a “private browsing” mode you may be able to block this information from being sent to Spiceworks, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the Service.</p> Cookies and Related Technologies <p>Spiceworks uses cookies, which are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are stored on your computer, to make the Service easier to use, to improve our advertising, and to protect you and Spiceworks.
For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Site.
We also use them to remember the last application page you visited and advertisements you’ve already seen.
You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Service.</p>
<p>Many of the advertisements you see when using the Service have been placed by third parties.
These third parties may choose to use their own cookies for the purposes of collecting information relating to the viewing of their advertising.
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover the use of cookies implemented by Spiceworks and does not describe third party cookies in detail or their privacy policies.</p>
<p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our site.
They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Site and your interaction with our products and services.</p>
<p>Small pieces of code called web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs), which are typically one-pixel images embedded in web pages or emails, are used in conjunction with cookies on the Service and our emails to help us manage and monitor our online advertising and wider business arrangements with third parties and for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity, and improving the quality of the Service.
These files allow us to aggregate anonymous information relating to advertising and website usage.
For example, the type of information collected includes information relating to page views.
These web beacons may be used to recognize third party cookies and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to the Site, allowing us to monitor the efficacy of our business relationships with third parties.</p>
<p>We also work with a third party to monitor certain pages of our Site for the purpose of reporting Site traffic and other advertising statistics.

No Personal Information is transferred to this third party.</p> How We Use The Information <p>
<strong>Internal and Service-Related Usage.</strong> We use data you input into or that is collected by the Service to perform the services requested in connection with those Services.
For example, if you input inventory data into one of the Web-based Offerings, we will use that information to display that inventory data to you when you use such Web-based Offering.
We use your payment information to collect payment for the applicable Services.
We may store and combine the Personal Information you submit or we collect via any part of the Service with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties (including SNS) in order to deliver the Service, to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.
We may use anonymized aggregate personal or environment information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising, and compare your environment configuration to those of the broader user community.
