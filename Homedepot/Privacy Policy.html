</p>
<p>
<strong>Secure Shopping:</strong> When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
The Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).</p>
<p>
<strong>Order Information</strong>: Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites.
The most recent versions of Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.</p>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
