However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites.
We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies:</strong> Our Sites use a technology called "cookies".
A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return.
All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.
If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences.
Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out.
You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tracer Tags: </strong>Our Sites may also use a technology called "tracer tags".
These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons".
This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites.
These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Online Advertising:</strong> We partner with third-party ad networks to deliver online advertising about our products and services when you visit our Sites or other websites on the Internet.Â These partnerships help us provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your particular interests, improve and optimize your experience on our Sites, and track the effectiveness of marketing efforts.Â To facilitate these online advertising efforts, our ad network partners may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about your activities on our Sites or other websites.Â You can choose not to have your information collected for this purpose.Â To learn more about online advertising based on this form of information collection, including how you can opt out of such collection, click here.</p>

<strong>Security Measures on Our Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Secure Shopping:</strong> When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server.
SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information.</p>
<p>The Home Depot also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online:</p>
<p>
<strong>Passwords: </strong>To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select.
We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
The Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).</p>
<p>
<strong>Order Information</strong>: Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites.
The most recent versions of Netscape Navigatorâ¢ and Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.</p>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, The Home Depot cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites.</p>
