decor</li>
<p>Just a girl in a thrift store - that's how it all began.
Susan, our co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, sold her favorite vintage finds from her dorm room.
Soon, a 'store' was born!</p>
<p>Vintage clothing and decor is still very near and dear to us, so we sell at least one item a day.
They go fast, so visit often to snag your own ModCloth one of a kind!</p>
