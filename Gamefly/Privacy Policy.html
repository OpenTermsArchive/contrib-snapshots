<p>
<strong>GameFly Account Registration</strong>
<br>To create a GameFly account, we ask you for certain personally identifying information, including your full name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and billing information (such as a credit card number).
We also ask you to create a password and to provide other information such as your gender, game and platform preferences (e.g., about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (including "demographic information") as part of your user profile - we may link this demographic information to your personal information.</p>
<p>Once collected, we use the information above to: (i) create, confirm and give you access to your GameFly account.
(ii) process and ship your orders.
(iii) communicate with you (via e-mail, SMS, MMS, or voice) about the status of your orders or to provide Buy Alerts and SMS/MMS messages you request.
(iv) answer any requests that you may have.
(v) send you GameFly newsletters that you have chosen to receive.
and (vi) serve advertisements to your Web browser that we believe may be of interest to you (<b>see "Online Advertising" below for more information</b>).
We may also use your GameFly account e-mail address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, new areas or features on our Website, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.
We may also use your personal and demographic information aggregated with other members' information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.</p>
<p>
<em>* If you want to be excluded from receiving promotional email communications, you may unsubscribe via the opt-out link embedded in the communication or by logging in to My Account and updating your E-mail Subscription preferences.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>GameFly App Account Registration</strong>
<br>To create a GameFly App account, we ask for certain personally identifying information, including your full name, email address, user name, password and birthday.
We ask you to provide other information as part of your "bio" or "profile," such as your gender, location and social network URLs and to create a user picture/avatar to display to others on the App.
We may also collect your unique device identifier and your telephone number and location if you have activated the GPS function on your mobile device.
The foregoing information is used to identify you to us and other users as a GameFly App user and to allow you to access the functionality provided on the App, such as posting messages and receiving App updates (e.g., when another App user responds to one of your posts, etc.).
Note that you can link the information contained in your GameFly and App accounts.</p>
<p>
<em>* You can create a GameFly App account without providing all of the requested information above.

</p>
<p>
<strong>GameFly Referrals</strong>

You and/or your friends may receive additional communications from us or our vendors in relation to the Referral Program and you and/or your friends' participation in it.
The data collected through the Referral Program is used only for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and will not be used for any other purpose or distributed to any third parties other than those GameFly vendors retained to operate and maintain the Referral Program.</p>
<p>
<em>* You and your friends may opt-out of participation in the Referral Program at any time via the opt-out links in the communications sent to you and your friends, or by sending us an e-mail to friends_optout@gamefly.com.</em>

While children under the age of 18 may utilize the GameFly video game rental/purchase service, they may do so only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian and subject to our <b>Terms of Use</b>.
We encourage parents to use our Parental Controls feature, which will allow you to control which games your child can rent or purchase under your account.
Therefore, if a parent or guardian is the account holder and manages Parental Controls, the account password should not be disclosed to the child.
Note that the GameFly Website and the GameFly App are not directed at collecting information from children under the age of 13, nor are they intended to be used by children under the age of 13.
If we receive notice that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information collected from that child.</p> How does GameFly protect my personal information? <p>GameFly employs security technologies and procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our Website visitors.

We have also implemented reasonable security guidelines for our employees, partners, and vendors.
We will continue to update and enhance our security practices as new technology becomes available.</p>
<p>While we take steps to ensure the security of your personal information, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, please be aware that when you submit information to us, you do so at your own risk.
To further protect your personal information, we ask that you play an important role as well.
Take care to prevent unauthorized persons from learning any of your GameFly account information.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for safeguarding your GameFly and GameFly App e-mail logins and passwords.
