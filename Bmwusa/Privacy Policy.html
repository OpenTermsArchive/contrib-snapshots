mail, fax or text message.
BMW NA does not participate in this type of solicitation.
Recipients of suspicious email like this should delete the message from their inbox and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block emails from the e-mail address being used.

Sites Traffic Monitoring<br>
We collect information about visits to our Sites by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other identifiers.
We use this information to determine how to make future visits more convenient and productive for all BMW enthusiasts.
We may also collect device type, browser type, access time, and the URL where a user is entering or exiting the Sites.
<ol>
<li>What should I do when I have finished accessing confidential data?<br>
<br> When you have finished using a secure area of the BMW Sites, make sure you always click on the 'Log Out' link in the upper right corner of the web page.
When you click on it, you will be given the option to end your secure session.
No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your BMW Login.</li>
<br>
<li>Why can I still see some of my account information even after I have left a secure area?<br>
<br> Browser software often 'caches' pages as you look at them, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory.
Therefore, you may find that clicking on your back button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page.
Please keep in mind that caching in no way affects the security of your confidential BMW Login.
If you use your computer in a public place, please read below.</li>
<br>
<li>What should I do if I am using a public computer?<br>
<br> If you use a computer that others also work on and you are uncomfortable that they may view 'cached' pages after you have left the station, quit/exit your browser software before leaving.
This will decrease the possibility of anyone viewing confidential information.
No other users will be able to access your account information online without your BMW Login.</li>
</ol>
<br>

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<br>
Cookies and similar technologies save you the trouble of reentering certain information in some areas, help to deliver content-specific information to you, and track which sections of the Sites are most popular.
A 'cookie' is actually a file that our webserver or the webserver of one of our third-party partners may send to your computer when you access one of our Sites.
This file is then stored on your computer.
<ol>
<li>Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?<br>
<br> We use cookies and related technologies for the following purposes:<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>After you have entered personal information into a form or data field on our Sites, cookies enable the Sites to 'remember' that information, should you so choose.
For example, in the registration area, cookies allow us to fill in your Login ID (email address) for you.
Similarly, cookies allow us to save the information you have entered into the Build Your Own feature.
The Build Your Own feature allows users to build their ideal BMW and save it on our server.
We use a cookie to identify which saved vehicle you customized.</li>
<br>
<li>Cookies and other passive information collection technologies enable us to deliver content that is tailored to your interests and preferences based on your past activity on the Sites.</li>
<br>
<li>Cookies and other passive information collection technologies enable us to compile aggregate statistics concerning use of the Sites, analyze trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Sites.</li>
</ol>
<br>
</li>
<li>What types of cookies and other tracking technologies do we use?<br>
<br> Our Sites may use the following types of cookies and tracking technologies, among others: <ol>
<li>'Session' cookies: Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off.
Session cookies are used, for example, to improve navigation on our Sites, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (e.g., the website may remember previous entries of age that are outside the permitted parameters and block subsequent changes) and to collect aggregated statistical information.</li>
<br>
<li>'Persistent' cookies: Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie.
Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., Login ID), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.</li>
</ol>
<br>
</li>
<li>'Web beacons' (also known as internet tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, and invisible GIFs): A web beacon is a tiny graphic on a web page or in an email message that is used to track pages viewed or messages opened.
Web beacons tell the Sites server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer.
Web beacons may be placed on online advertisements that bring people to our Sites and on different pages of our Sites.
Web beacons provide us with information on how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.</li>
<br>
<li>Why do we allow third-party partners to place cookies on your computer?<br>
<br> Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers.
One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom we work to place their own cookies or similar markers when an individual visits our Sites.
This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Sites.
When the individual visits a third-party website on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individual's interest in BMW products and services and deliver one of our advertisements.</li>
<br>
<li>What choices do I have regarding the delivery of targeted advertisements on third-party sites?<br>
<br> BMW of North America adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising <u>(www.AboutAds.info)</u>.
The Digital Advertising Alliance maintains a website where consumers can opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of the network advertising companies participating in the program <u>(www.AboutAds.info/choices).</u>
<br>
<br> In addition, most internet browsers allow you to change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it, or to automatically refuse all cookies.
Please be aware that some functionality of our Sites that relies on the use of cookies may not be available should you choose to refuse all cookies.
In addition, because BMW NA does not control these management tools, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
11.
Do Not Track<br>
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services.
At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, BMW NA and the Sites do not recognize DNT.<br>
<br>
12.
