<strong>What should I do when I have finished accessing confidential data?</strong>
<br>When you have finished using a secure area of the BMW website, make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link in the upper right corner of the web page.
When you click on it, you will be given the option to end your secure session.
No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your BMW Login.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why can I still see some of my account information even after I have left a secure area?</strong>
<br>Browser software often "caches" pages as you look at them, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory.
Therefore, you may find that clicking on your back button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page.
Please keep in mind that caching in no way affects the security of your confidential BMW Login.
If you use your computer in a public place, please read below.<br>
<br>
<strong>What should I do if I am using a public computer?</strong>
<br>If you use a computer that others also work on and you are uncomfortable that they may view "cached" pages after you have left the station, quit/exit your browser software before leaving.
This will decrease the possibility of anyone viewing confidential information.
No other users will be able to access your account information online without your BMW Login.<br>
