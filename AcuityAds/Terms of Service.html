		<h3>Revised: June 15th, 2021</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”) are entered into between AcuityAds Inc. (“Acuity”), an Ontario corporation with offices at 70 University Ave, Suite 1200 Toronto, ON M5J 2M4 Canada and the entity specified in the applicable Insertion Order (the “IO”, and together with the Terms and Conditions, the “Agreement”) with offices at the address specified in the IO. Acuity reserves the right to update and change these Terms and Conditions from time to time without notice to Advertiser.</p>
<ol>
<li>Definitions</li>

<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1.1 “Ad” means any advertisement (including, without limitation, all logos, trademarks, creative materials, graphic images and copy therein) provided to Acuity, directly or indirectly, by Advertiser, including without limitation banner advertisements, text advertisements and video advertisements (as such terms are understood in the online advertising industry) and advertisements received from Contracted Clients.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1.4 “Advertiser” shall mean the Advertiser set forth in the IO and shall, for purposes of Advertiser’s obligations under these Terms and Conditions, include any Contracted Client. The obligations of Advertiser and a Contracted Client under this Agreement shall be joint and several.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1.7 “Platform” means the advertising machine learning advertising platform developed and owned by Acuity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For clarity, all capitalized terms used in these Terms and Conditions but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the IO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>LICENSE</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">2.1 Acuity hereby grants to Advertiser a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for purposes of conducting Campaigns during the Term in accordance with this Agreement. As between Advertiser and Acuity, Advertiser acknowledges that Acuity is the owner of all intellectual property rights in and to the Platform including all content thereon (other than the Ads) and, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, Advertiser shall not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing that will in any way impair the rights of Acuity in and to the Platform. Nothing in this Agreement grants, nor shall Advertiser acquire hereby, any right, title or interest in or to the Platform or any goodwill associated with the Platform, other than those rights expressly granted hereunder. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights in the Platform granted to Advertiser hereunder shall automatically revert to Acuity, and Advertiser shall have no further rights in the Platform.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">2.2 Acuity will provide Platform and sales training as well as support over the phone and WebEx as needed by Advertiser. An aggregate of thirty (30) hours of such training and support will be provided to Advertiser during any twelve consecutive months at no additional charge. If Advertiser requests more than 30 hours of training and support, Advertiser will pay Acuity for consulting services at a rate of one-hundred dollars ($100) net per hour. If Advertiser requests in person training, Advertiser will reimburse Acuity for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">2.3 Advertiser’s use of the Platform shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances as well as any written policies or procedures that Acuity may provide to Advertiser from time to time in connection with Advertiser’s use of the Platform. Acuity reserves the right to monitor the Platform and Advertiser’s use of the Platform from time to time in its sole discretion.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>SALES AGENCY</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Acuity hereby grants Advertiser the limited, non-transferrable right (the “Selling Rights”) to act as the sales representative for the Platform (the “Sales Agency Services”) and to provide advertising services to third parties through the Platform (“Advertiser Services”). Exercise of these rights entitle Advertiser:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3.1 to advertise the existence of the Platform and the Advertiser Services;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3.2 to enter into and execute agreements (in such form as Acuity may approve from time to time) in respect of the Advertiser Services (the “Advertiser Agreements”). For purposes of this Agreement, upon entering into an Advertiser Agreement, a third party shall be a “Contracted Client”;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3.3 to process all payments from Contracted Clients received in connection with the Advertiser Services (the “Payment Processing”);</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3.4 to carry out such other duties and obligations as are specifically authorized by this Agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Exercise of the Selling Rights shall be at Advertiser’s sole cost and expense and shall require Advertiser to provide to Acuity such content and information about the Contracted Client and the Advertiser Services to be provided to such Contracted Client, as Acuity may request.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For the avoidance of doubt, Advertiser shall not permit any Contracted Client to directly use or access the Platform without the written consent of Acuity. Rather, Advertiser shall only have the right to use the Platform on behalf of, and for the Contracted Client’s benefit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Advertiser shall submit to Acuity for review any and all advertisements and/or marketing materials (collectively, “Marketing Materials”) to be used by Advertiser in connection with the Sales Agency Services and Advertiser Services. Acuity shall have the right to approve or reject the Marketing Materials in its sole discretion. Advertiser shall not make any representations, warranties, statements or claims about the Platform, except as approved by Acuity in its sole discretion.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>OBLIGATION OF PARTIES</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Advertiser hereby grants to Acuity a worldwide, royalty free, sub-licensable, non-exclusive right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, publicly and digitally display and perform, transmit and broadcast (collectively, “Use”) the Ads (and any trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, URLs or other proprietary rights of Advertiser therein) in connection with the Campaign.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Advertiser represents and warrants to Acuity that each Ad (and any and all content therein) and the distribution thereof in accordance with this Agreement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.1 complies, as applicable, with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less (US), and/or the IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less and Late Creative Policy (Canada);</p>

<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.3 does not violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation regarding the creation and marketing of online materials including, without limitation, those governing false and/or deceptive advertising;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.4 is true, accurate and complete;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.5 is not unlawful, defamatory or libelous;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.6 is not pornographic or obscene; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.7 does not contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.8 Advertiser further represents and warrants that:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px;">4.8.2 Advertiser has paid, or will have paid prior to use thereof, to the proper person, firm or corporation when due and payable, all residual, re-use or similar payments, all step-up fees, all music synchronization fees or royalties, all mechanical reproduction fees or royalties, all performance rights fees or royalties and all license payments and all other amounts payable to third parties as a result of, or in connection with, the Use of the Ads hereunder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">4.8.3 Advertiser represents and warrants that it is in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAA OBA Principles”) and the Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAAC OBA Principles”), including the provision of appropriate notice and choice of online behavioral advertising. Advertiser represents and warrants that any websites where data is collected for online behavioral advertising provides users notice that third parties will collect data for purposes of serving targeted ads and provide a link to a means by which users may opt out of such targeted ads, such as www.aboutads.info or www.youradchoices.ca. For Advertiser’s convenience, we offer the following sample privacy disclosure, but strongly encourage Advertiser to work with counsel to ensure that these disclosures accurately represent Advertiser’s practices as legal requirements may change and/or be subject to differing legal interpretations: “We use a third-party service provider to serve ads and/or collect data on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website.  They may collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services to tailor advertising messages on this website and other sites.  The information collected by these third-parties may include your devices IP address, user agent and other device level pseudonymous information.

<p style="padding-left: 80px;">4.9 Acuity represents that in providing the Services, it shall adhere to applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable privacy law and Data Protection Laws and that the Platform shall operate as described in Acuity’s privacy policy located <a href="https://privacy.acuityads.com/corporate-privacy-policy.html">here</a>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acuity reserves the right to run campaigns on the platform of its choosing at its sole discretion.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Acuity Ads Inc. will invoice Advertiser monthly. Unless otherwise stated in the IO, Advertiser shall remit payment to the Acuity within thirty (30) days of receipt of the applicable invoice. All late payments shall bear interest at the rate of 2% per month, or the highest rate allowable by law, whichever is lower. Advertiser agrees that it shall be solely liable for payment to Acuity of all amounts owing pursuant to the terms hereof, and (if Advertiser is an agency or intermediary) it shall make all necessary payments hereunder, notwithstanding any non-payment to Advertiser by any third party.</p>

<ol start="9">
<li>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p><u>Appendix 1 Subject matter and details of the processing</u></p>
<p><u>Data exporter</u>:           The data exporter is the AcuityAds, Inc.</p>
<p><u>Data importer</u>:           The data importer is Buyer</p>
<p><u>Data subjects</u>:            The Personal Data concern the following categories of Data Subjects:</p>

<p>Data pertaining to the personnel of both parties necessary for the respective parties’ performance of the Agreement including email addresses, telephone numbers, name, title and billing information.</p>
<p><u>Special categories of data </u>(if appropriate)</p>
<p>The personal data transferred concern the following special categories of data (please specify): None</p>
<p><u>Processing operations</u>: The Personal Data transferred will be subject to the following processing activities:</p>
<p>The data exporter will access, reproduce, display and store the relevant personal data in order to provide the services as set out in the Agreement.</p>
<p><u>Appendix 2 Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter in accordance with Clauses 4(d) and 5(c) (or document/legislation):</u></p>
<p>Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter</p>
<p><em>Measures with which Personal Data can be processed while denying physical access to IT systems for unauthorised persons (access control):</em></p>
<p>All of the data exporter’s third-party data centers have strict policies for authorization of access into the facilities.   Each data center vendor has appropriate policies required by external audits.  All of the data exporter’s internal personnel are vetted prior to allowing access to data centers.</p>
<p><em>Measures to hinder unauthorised persons from using IT systems and procedures (access control):</em></p>
<p>All systems level access is based on directory services and role based security.  Additional measures are in place such as VPN and other security measures prior to system level access being available, as described below.  All end user level access to AcuityAds’ systems is based on role based security.  Shared accounts are not allowed.</p>
<p>The data exporter undertakes the following actions, among others, to ensure that persons authorised to use the Acuity Platform or access data processing infrastructure can only access the data underlying their access authorization and that stored data or data undergoing processing cannot be read, copied, altered, or removed without authorization.</p>
<p>The data exporter’s employees access infrastructure components with unique accounts that require strong passwords.  Remote administration is available only via public key cryptography and password based authentication is not permitted.  Access groups have been established to restrict access to only to specific areas that are required for employee responsibilities.</p>
<p>Customers of the data exporter may be granted access to the AcuityAds console. Access to the AcuityAds console is limited via a user name and a password to the customer’s authorised persons and additionally to equivalently authorised employees of the data exporter.  Logical infrastructure configuration prevents the access of one customer’s data by another customer.</p>
<p><em>Measures to enable persons authorised to use IT procedures to gain exclusive access to the Personal Data that are subject to their access authorisation (access control):</em></p>
<p>The data exporter employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. The data exporter requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with the data exporter’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.</p>
<p>In addition, the data exporter has implemented several security related policies that govern the use of AcuityAds technology and data including rules around acceptable use, data classification, information security, and passwords.  The data exporter’s information security officer is Rachel Kapcan.</p>
<p><em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, amended or removed by unauthorised persons when the data is transmitted electronically, or when it is being transported, or when it is being stored on data carriers but which allow checks to be made of the destinations targeted when transferring Personal Data using data transmission equipment (routing controls):</em></p>
<p>Data is encrypted by measures such as SSL.  Personal data shall not be transferred outside the scope as authorised under these Clauses, or as otherwise authorised by the data importer.</p>
<p><em>Measures that allow retrospective checks to be made on whether Personal Data has been entered into, amended or removed from IT systems, and by whom (input controls):</em></p>
<p>All data processed in Acuity Platform by an end user of the platform (e.g., CL personnel) is done on a permissions based model, all user accounts are enabled/disabled in accordance with the security policy.  All accounts are individual. Shared accounts are not allowed. Audit Trail is kept for user actions and is logged.</p>
<p>Email and corporate systems access is granted based on directory services and role based security.</p>
<p><em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data to be processed on CONTROLLER’s behalf is only processed in accordance with CONTROLLER’s directives (performance controls):</em></p>
<p>The data importer is a user of the Acuity Platform, therefore setting up of data collection mechanisms, collection of data, verifying data integrity sit with the data importer. The personal data shall only be processed in the manner authorised under these Clauses and all sub processors shall only be employed in compliance with the provisions of these Clauses.</p>
<p><em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data is protected against incidental damage or loss (availability controls):</em></p>
<p>Data is kept in a storage framework with at least three copies natively made and stored. Additionally, the data exporter replicates data between data centers for disaster recovery with ability to restore if needed, although the data exporter will not replicate lat/long or other data points which might be considered sensitive in the EU.</p>
<p><em>Measures to ensure that the different purposes for processing data can be identified – especially for PROCESSOR’s different controllers – and that data to be processed is processed separately from each other (separation controls):</em></p>
<p>AcuityAds stores data in a multi-tenant environment on servers owned by AcuityAds. The Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple data centers. AcuityAds logically isolates data on a per end user basis at the application layer. AcuityAds logically separates Customer’s data, including data from different end users, from each other, and data for an authenticated end user will not be displayed to another end user (unless the former end user or administrator allows the data to be shared). A central authentication system is used across all Services to increase uniform security of data.</p>
<p><em>Measures to ensure availability and resiliency for data and technical operations:</em></p>
<p>AcuityAds stores data and operates servers in datacenters with robust and redundant power and data storage mechanisms. All deployments are configured with repeatable operating templates, for rapid deployment to a DR region when necessary. All networks are protected by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other industry best practice security measures.</p>
<p><em>Measures for regular testing, assessment and evaluation:</em></p>
<p>AcuityAds regularly reviews system activity rated by security threat level by our intrusion detection platform. AcuityAds regularly runs external network scans to ensure operating systems, libraries, and all used software is patched against vulnerabilities. All platform configurations are catalogued within version control and issued via peer-reviewed pull requests to ensure multiple reviewers of each security related change.</p>
<p><em>Measures for pseudonymization of data:</em></p>
<p>AcuityAds works with upstream data controllers to ensure no PII enters our system. Any e-mail addresses are hashed prior to ingestion into the platform which would render them as pseudonymous personal data by the time they reach AcuityAds’ systems. Where AcuityAds acts to track activity with cookies, the platform will be disabling inbound traffic to our pixel collection from any IP address that the company determines is coming from the EU.</p>
