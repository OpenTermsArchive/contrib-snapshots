Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data.
they only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works.
In-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept push notifications (sometimes shown as 'PNS' on your devices), must be enabled for a beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device.
Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Bloomingdale's as well as other non-Bloomingdale's applications and advertisers.

Some examples of data automatically collected through our Wi-Fi service include: </li>
<li> Information about your device, including a MAC address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.
</li>
<li> Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.
</li>
<li> Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.
</li>
</ul>
<br> 9.
RFID (FUL, OPS, SEC) <br>
<ul>
<li> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects.
RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data.

RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.

Additional Disclosures <br> Information About Children Under 13 <br> The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act imposes requirements on Web sites that collect personal information about children under 13 years old (for example - name, address, email address, social security number, etc.).
Our current policy is not to collect any personal information on any person under 13 years old online.
For this reason, our sweepstakes and other promotions conducted online are restricted to entrants who are at least 13 years old.
<br> If this policy changes, we will revise this portion of our Notice of Privacy Practices and will comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which includes providing notice and choice to each child's parent or guardian before collecting any personal information.
<br> Opt-In Consent for Minors <br> Bloomingdale's services are offered to the customers who are of the age 16 years and above.
No programs, services or offerings are intended for children under the age of 16.
Also, credit products are not available for the customer below the age of 18 years.
<br> International Customer Privacy <br> To fill international orders, bloomingdales.com partners with Borderfree, Inc.
(formerly FiftyOne).
Borderfree will carefully process your personal information with at least the same level of privacy protection consistent with the former U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S.
Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles established by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
Borderfree also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international shipments.
<br> When you indicate you are shipping internationally, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by Borderfree.
On the checkout page you will be required to submit personal information to Borderfree to complete your order.
Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from bloomingdales.com.
<br> Borderfree will notify bloomingdales.com of the approval of your order, and bloomingdales.com will then ship approved orders to Borderfree.
Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority, and arrange for the product to be delivered to you.
In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions.
You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.
<br> Once you agree that Borderfree may share your personal information with bloomingdales.com, that data is protected by this Notice of Privacy Practices, and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.
<br> Our practices are consistent with both the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.
<br> Bloomingdale's is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy.
If a customer feels that their privacy may have been violated, based on the Safe Harbor Principles, bloomingdales.com will attempt to directly resolve the complaint.
Any complaints that are still unresolved after these direct efforts will be settled by arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its applicable commercial rules.
