</p> Lowe's Privacy and Security Statement
<p>We respect the privacy of our customers.
This Privacy and Security statement is designed to help you understand what information we gather online and what we do with that information.
Because Lowes.com will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change without prior notice.
For that reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically.
Registered users will be notified by email of any material changes in either the scope of the privacy seal, the language of the privacy notice or our information practices and given the chance to opt out of any new uses.
By using our website, you agree to the terms of the privacy policy in effect at that time.</p>

Information We Gather
<p>The type of information we gather online is summarized into six general categories.
The following explains why we collect this information and how we use it.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> <strong>General Tracking Information<br>
</strong>We keep track of the pages visited by each user.
Our Web server automatically collects some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your IP address.
Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>
<p>We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns.
We use this information to improve Lowes.com by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users.
<strong>This information does not identify you personally</strong>.</p>
<p>On occasion we may provide this aggregate information to vendors, investors, potential advertisers or news agencies to demonstrate the amount of interest in Lowes.com and to help us plan for technical infrastructure requirements.</p>
<p>
<strong>2. </strong>
<strong>Click Path Tracking <br>
</strong>Using cookie technology (see below for more information), we track your click path through Lowes.com.
We use this information to help customize your visit to our website.
For instance, if you read a how-to on lawn care, on your next visit to our website, we may present to you a how-to on fertilizing your lawn or display a new product for lawn irrigation.</p>
<p>
<strong>3. </strong>
<strong>Registration Information (only if registered at Lowes.com) <br>
</strong>In order to register on Lowes.com, you must provide your:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and Last Name</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>ZIP Code</li>
<li>Password</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Registration is an optional service provided by Lowes.com.</strong>
</p>
<p>If you choose to register:</p>
<ul>
<li>We require your first and last names to help us differentiate your registration profile from others at Lowes.com.
They also allow us to automatically populate shipping information forms should you decide to order from Lowes.com.
We require a mailing address in order to make the checkout process faster.
Your address will also be added to our customer information database to allow Lowe's to research and offer products and services specifically designed for you and customers like you.</li>
<li>We require a phone number in case there is a problem with your order.
We will not telemarket to you.
However, you may be called and asked to participate in an optional Lowe's telephone survey designed to help us improve your shopping experience.</li>
<li>We require a ZIP code so that you can shop the Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse nearest you.
We can also deliver content appropriate to your region.
For example, if you live in Southern California, we wouldn't want to feature on your home page a how-to on preparing for severe winter storms.
</li>
<li>We require an email address because, unlike your first and last name, it identifies you uniquely.
We will send you an email confirming your registration on Lowes.com, and in the event you forget your password, we will send it to your email address at your request.
Periodically, we will send promotional emails describing new features or products.
You may unsubscribe to these emails at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Lowes.com email.</li>
<li>We require a password to provide you secure access to your user profile and preferences.
If you forget your password, at your request we can email it to the email address you chose in your profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you register as a professional in the housing, home improvement or property management industry and subscribe to our commercial customer's newsletter, we ask for your occupation.
This data is used to select the most pertinent articles for use in the newsletter and on Lowes.com.</p>
<p>When you register, you will also have the opportunity to sign up for email newsletters on certain subjects.
These newsletters will be sent to you only if you choose to place your name on our mailing list.
In order for us to deliver these newsletters, we may need to pass your name and email address to our service providers who supply us this email service.
We also use a third-party company to authenticate and validate the information you provide to us.
Your registration information is merged with information provided by the third party for our marketing purposes.
The information you provide while visiting Lowes.com is combined with marketing research from internal and external sources.
The information will be used to determine shopping and informational preferences.</p>
<p>We have legally binding agreements with these service providers that prohibit them from using your information for any purpose other than what Lowe's instructs them to do with it.
Therefore, if you sign up for the email newsletters, you do not need to worry about receiving unsolicited emails from other companies as a result of Lowe's releasing your information.</p>
<p>If you ever need to view, change, update or delete any of your registration information, log in and click Your Account at the top of the screen.
You will be taken to a page where you can access your information so that you can edit it.</p>
<p>If at any time you no longer wish to receive newsletters from Lowes.com, email remove@lowes.com, and type REMOVE FROM NEWSLETTER LIST in the subject line.
You may also choose this option in the Your Account section on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>If you want to be removed from all Lowe's marketing, choose one of the following options: email remove@lowes.com, and type REMOVE FROM ALL MARKETING in the subject line.

Box 1111, N.
Wilkesboro, NC 28659.

This analysis allows Lowe's to provide the highest quality products and services possible.</p>
<p>
<strong>We do NOT sell to third parties under any circumstances the personal information you provide to complete your order.
We request a contact phone number in case one of our Customer Care representatives would need to reach you, such as in order to arrange a delivery time.</strong>
</p>
<p>We request your email address because we send a single email message acknowledging receipt of your order.
This message contains the list of items you purchased, a reference number, delivery method (store pickup, Lowe's Home Delivery or parcel delivery) and the total amount of items requested, but it does NOT contain your credit card number.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong> <strong>Lowe's Credit Card Information <br>

Security Information
<p>We understand that many consumers are concerned about security on the Internet.
The Web server at Lowes.com is designed for Internet commerce and employs industry-standard methods of protecting the security of information sent over the website.
This statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional information about how we handle your credit card information.
We want you to be able to shop on Lowes.com with confidence.

Is the Information I Send You Secure While It Is Being Sent?
<p>We strive to protect the security of the information you send to us while it is en route to Lowes.com.
Every page of our website on which information is exchanged between you and Lowe's employs Secure Sockets Layer technology.
Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, is a secure and encrypted method of communicating between your browser software and our Web server.
SSL is the most common method of secure communication used on the Internet, and SSL technology is built into most major browsers.
When you provide information or place an order with us, the information is sent to us via this secure, encrypted SSL connection.
A quick method of identifying a secure Web page is to look at the address of the page.
Secure pages will usually appear with an address that starts with <em>https://</em> rather than the <em>standard http://</em>.</p>
<p>Lowe's Companies provides links to websites outside of Lowes.com as an added convenience to the user.
Any link included does not imply or convey endorsement of the other company or organization, its website or its products or services.
Lowe's Companies is not responsible for the privacy, terms of use or other policies of any other website.</p>

Is the Information I am Sending Really Going to Lowe’s?
<p>We have also obtained a Verisign™ digital security certificate for Lowes.com.
Verisign™ is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet.
By registering with Verisign™, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the information you are sending is going to Lowe's.</p>
Back to Top
What Happens to My Information After You Receive It?
<p>SSL protects information en route to us, and the Verisign™ certificate confirms that we are the recipients of this information.
How the information is handled after it arrives is every bit as important to maintaining security.
Once you are finished shopping and you have typed in your shipping information, email address and credit card information and you have clicked Submit Order, your encrypted information is sent to our server.
All data collected is stored on Lowes.com and may be accessed by Lowe's Companies, its wholly owned subsidiaries and contracted third-party service providers.</p>

Therefore, we do not warrant or ensure the security of any information sent to us online.
