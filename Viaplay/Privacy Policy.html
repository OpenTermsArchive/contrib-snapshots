Introduction</h3><p>Your right to privacy is at the forefront of everything we do. Our aim is to provide you with the best streaming service with content tailored and personalized just for you. For that, we need to process your personal data, and this Privacy Statement (this or the “Statement”) will explain to you in a transparent manner how that is done, from the collection, storage, usage and sharing of your personal data.</p><p></p><p>This Statement applies to you when creating and using your account with Viaplay, browsing our websites and applications, participating in surveys, contests, user groups, subscribing to our newsletter or otherwise when you are communicating with us through social media or by using any of our other channels.</p><p></p><p>We encourage you to read this Statement closely. If you have any questions regarding anything stated here or otherwise regarding our privacy work or handling of cookies and other technologies, you are welcome to contact us by using the contact information in Section 8. For any questions or help with the Viaplay service, we refer to <a href="help.viaplay.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">help.viaplay.com</a> or our customer service.</p><p></p><h5><strong>Data controller and service provision for Viaplay UK customers</strong></h5><p>Viaplay is a service provided by Viaplay Group UK Limited, corporate identification number 02228654, with address Chiswick Green, 610 Chiswick High Road, W4 5RU London. Viaplay Group UK is a joint data controller together with Viaplay Group Sweden AB (together referred to as Viaplay Group), for the processing of personal data under this Statement and will use your personal data as is described below. You can exercise your rights by using the contact details under section 8 below.</p><p></p><h5><strong>Data controller and service provision for PMBL customer</strong></h5><p>If you have purchased your subscription through Premier Media Broadcasting Limited, then Viaplay will be provided to you by Viaplay Group Ireland Limited (under change of name from Premier Media Broadcasting Limited), corporate identification number 620991, registered office at Broadcasting House, 3a Prince&#x27;s Street South, Dublin 2, D02 A520, Republic of Ireland. Viaplay Group Ireland is a joint controller together with Viaplay Group Sweden AB (together referred to as Viaplay Group), for the processing of personal data under this Statement and will use your personal data as is described below. You can exercise your rights by using the contact details under section 8 below.</p><p></p><h4>1.1 Minors</h4><p>You must be at least 18 years of age to create a Viaplay account. We do not knowingly market towards, nor collect personal data regarding minors. Minors may only use Viaplay with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian. Parents or legal guardians are strongly recommended to set up a children’s profile, which will filter out any content deemed inappropriate for minors, before letting children use Viaplay.</p><p></p><h4>1.2 Third party services, devices, and links</h4><p>Please note that in some situations, we are not the only ones who process your personal data when you enjoy Viaplay’s content. For example, when you use Viaplay on your game console or smart TV, then the company that provides you with that console or TV may also process your personal data as an independent data controller, with no connection to what is written in this Statement. The same applies if you click a link that leads you to a third-party website. In these cases, such company’s corresponding information on data protection will also apply to you. If you choose to use Viaplay through a third-party player (such as Apple Tv etc.) you might also be asked to share certain personal data with or from such third-party player. You will receive information about possible sharing before it is carried out. You can find more information about the third parties having access to your personal data in section 3.</p><p></p><h3>2. How we process your personal data</h3><p>In this section, we explain how your personal data is used for us to provide you with Viaplay and related relevant experiences, services, offers and our interest in improving the service.</p><p></p><p>Personal data means any information that can be linked to you either directly or indirectly. It could be your name, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number, IP address, viewing history and information about interests and preferences.</p><p></p><h4>2.1 What kind of personal data do we process and how do we collect it?</h4><p></p><p>We can collect your personal data in several ways:</p><p></p><h5><strong>2.1.1 Information that you provide us with directly, for example when using Viaplay, communicating with our customer service, participating in a contest, or answering surveys</strong></h5><p></p><ul><li>name, email address, telephone number, home address including postal code, date of birth or age, payment details (see section 2.2.6 below) and other information you provide under the respective profiles when creating and/or maintaining your user profile,</li><li>correspondence when you contact us (recordings of phone calls, emails, chat, etc.),</li><li>email address, home address or phone number when you sign up for receiving our marketing communications,</li><li>information that you provide whilst participating in a contest,</li><li>where applicable and requested, your preferences in relation to content you are interested in, if you choose to share such information with us,</li><li>user information that you choose to provide such as ratings, reviews and responses to surveys,</li><li>data related to your social media account when you share content from Viaplay or contact us through social media (please note that the social media provider’s own privacy policies will also apply to you when acting under your social media account),</li><li>username and password.<br/><br/></li></ul><h5><strong>2.1.2 Data generated when you use Viaplay</strong></h5><p></p><p>While you are enjoying the content on Viaplay, we gather and further process data about your use of the service.</p><p></p><p>The gathered data is processed, among other things, based on your behaviour and is connected to your specific user profile to give you a personalized experience. You can always create additional user profiles to have a tailored profile for each person within your household using Viaplay (please note that everyone with access to your account will have access to all the user profiles).</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, and subject to your cookie settings, your browsing behaviour on our platforms during your logout experience may also be linked to you and used to provide you with a personalized experience once you log in (see further in section 2.2.1 below).</p><p></p><p><strong>Data generated through use of Viaplay:</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Information about the user profile’s behaviour, such as viewing behaviour, streaming history, content in “My list”, where a user profile left off a stream (the functionality called “continue watching”), and how the profile navigates through the service,</li><li>Country of residence (the country you signed up for), and location (the country you are accessing the content from),</li><li>Other data collected through cookies or similar technologies, about your visits on Viaplay platforms. Some of the cookies used on any Viaplay platform may be used for marketing purposes (see section 2.2.3 to read more about Marketing and learn more about how we use cookies <a href="https://viaplay.com/gb-en/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).</li><li>Limited information about your social media account, such as your email address, when you share Viaplay content on your social media (however, we do not use such information for any purpose).</li></ul><p></p><h5><strong>2.1.3 Data we share or obtain from external sources</strong></h5><p></p><p>Sometimes, we share or obtain personal data from other sources. This sharing of data is necessary either for us or the sharing party. For example:</p><ul><li>We share data within our group of companies to achieve our business purposes and to enable marketing of our services, in compliance with legal requirements,</li><li>We share and receive information with and from payment service providers that enable you to pay for your subscription or any content you are buying or renting on Viaplay,</li><li>We may need to share and receive information to give you access to Viaplay via one of our business partners, distributors and other third parties where Viaplay is integrated,</li><li>We may obtain information if we have a legitimate interest in collecting such information from an official body regarding e.g., a claim that concerns us directly or indirectly.</li><li>We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of advertisement interactions and online conversions, with advertising platforms to understand the impact of Viaplay’s digital marketing campaigns.</li></ul><h4></h4><h4>2.2 For what purposes do we use your personal data and what legal basis is used?</h4><p>We process your personal data for a variety of purposes, all under the umbrella of providing you with Viaplay. Each purpose is connected to a so-called legal basis, which we rely upon to lawfully process your personal data. A legal basis could be performance of contract, meaning that the processing is carried out by us to fulfil our contractual obligation to you, which is created for example when you accept our <a href="https://viaplay.com/gb-en/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Terms</a>. We may also use legitimate interest as a legal basis, meaning that our reason for processing personal data outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights. In order for us to do so, we always perform a balancing test to ensure that we have considered and weighed any privacy impact in relation to the interest in question. We consider what is necessary and reasonably expected by you, but also how to minimise any impact on your data protection rights, for example by always pseudonymising data where possible. If you object to your personal data being processed based on our legitimate interests, you can contact us using the contact information under section 8 below. We could at times also ask for your consent to use your data. If consent is the legal basis, you are always given the option to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Lastly, we may at times have a legal obligation to process your data.</p><p></p><p>Below are the various purposes for which we process your personal data, including the applicable legal basis for such processing.</p><p></p><h5><strong>2.2.1 Provision of Viaplay</strong></h5><p>We process your personal data to administer and provide you with Viaplay, such as to:</p><ul><li>identify you as a customer and/or user,</li><li>charge for the services you use (administer invoices and payments) and ensuring recurrency of subscription payments,</li><li>ensure the technical functionality of Viaplay,</li><li>provide you with tailored and personalized content based on your viewing and browsing behaviour as well as other information you provide us with (read more about personalisation <a href="https://www.viaplaygroup.com/about/data-privacy/data-privacy-behavioural-data-personalisation-and-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>)</li><li> provide you with customer service,</li><li>remedy faults and deal with complaints addressed by you,</li><li>notify you of changes to our services.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal basis: Performance of contract and legitimate interest</strong></p><p></p><h5><strong>2.2.2 Improving Viaplay</strong></h5><p>We process your personal data, such as information on how you use Viaplay, to develop and improve our services, for example by:</p><ul><li>compiling different types of data, such as viewing behaviour, into statistics for analytical needs, for example to see what content that is successful on the service and what is not, what features that can be improved and how to make the navigation on the service more user-friendly</li><li>allowing you to provide feedback through different customer surveys (sometimes based on your viewing and user behaviour within Viaplay) for the reasons mentioned in the point above but also to ensure that we meet customer expectations and can continue to raise customer satisfaction, and</li><li>understanding, diagnosing, troubleshooting, and fixing issues in our services.</li></ul><p></p><p>Furthermore, and subject to your cookie settings, we may also use data connected to your logout experience to run A/B and other website testing, as part of our efforts to improve our website’s content and understand what works best for our visitors. </p><p></p><p>In most cases, any analysing of data is performed based on pseudonymised data that is separated from your customer account.</p><p></p><p><strong>Legal basis: Legitimate interest and consent</strong></p><p></p><h5><strong>2.2.3 Marketing</strong></h5><p>We may use your e-mail address, home address or phone number in order to provide you with offers, news, recommendations etc. to market our services or, where you have consented thereto specifically, our partner’s services.
