Each App sends us the device's UID, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your device.

This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the App for future releases.
As part of these error reports, the App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred.
We may use this information to investigate and remediate the error and to assist you in completing an impacted booking.</li>
</ul>You have the ability to control what information an App sends to us.
