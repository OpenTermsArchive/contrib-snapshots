For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website.
We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and bookings made.
Our goals in collecting this automatic information are helping customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud.

<br>Social Media.
If you make use of any Hotels.com social media features, either on our website, an App or otherwise through a social media provider, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with their policies.
For example, we offer the option to register with our website via the “Facebook Connect” feature, allowing you to register with our website using your Facebook account data without entering the required data manually on our webpage.
When using a social media feature and if you have chosen to include it in your social media account, we may access information such as your name, profile picture, gender, birthday, email address, town or district and any other information you have chosen to make available.
Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations (“Location Data”) to provide you with relevant content.

We may also access information from social media providers about your use of an App that we run on their website.<br>
<br>
<strong>How we use your information</strong>
<br>
<br>We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the hotel reservations you make on our website or through an App.
We use other information about you for the following general purposes so long as you have given your consent: to provide you with the products and services you request.

to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications.
to communicate with you in general.
to respond to your questions and comments.
to measure interest in and improve our products, services, website and our Apps.
to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you.
to otherwise customize your experience with this website or our Apps.

and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.<br>
<br>Email Communications.
We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website and through our Apps.
One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your hotel related interests if you consented to receiving email marketing communications.
Where legally required, we will abide by existing publicly available opt-out lists when sending you marketing communications.
For example, if you search for a hotel in New York on our website but choose not to book a hotel, we may send you an email message telling you about our special deals for hotels in New York.
We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our website and our Apps.
Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.<br>Please review “Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information” below.<br>

<br>We may share your information with the following entities:<br>
<br>•    Suppliers such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfil your travel reservations.
All services provided by a third party are described as such.
Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through this website or any App.
Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit.
While we may share anonymous reviews with our hotel suppliers, we will not share reviewer names or contact information unless you have explicitly told us that we may.
We are not responsible for the hotel deducing your identity from the content of your review and contacting you directly.<br>
<br>•    Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention.
We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or our Apps or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests.
Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
They are also required to follow the same data security practices that we ourselves adhere to.
Please note that these third party service providers may be established in countries that might not offer a level of protection for your personal information that is equivalent to the one offered in your country of residence.
However, we will endeavor to protect all personal information we collect from you in accordance with strict data protection standards.<br>

They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.<br>
<br>•    Social media providers.
When you access certain Hotels.com social media features through our website or Apps, you are sharing information with the social media provider (such as Facebook) and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies (including that we may access such information via the social media provider).

<br>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.
<br>
<br>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.

<strong>Cookies and other technologies</strong>
<br>
<br>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost all websites.
Cookies do not recognize you personally and are not harmful to your computer or mobile device.
They are used by websites you visit in order to improve your experience on the website, to provide us with analytics information that will help us improve our website generally, and to collect information about travel destinations of interest to you so that you may see travel ads more relevant to you.<br>
<br>For instance, we use cookies on our site to allow you to login without having to type your login name each time.
Other cookies help us to understand what did and didn’t interest you about our website so we can provide you with features that are more relevant and useful to you next time you visit.
We and some of our partners also use cookies on our site to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our site and how visitors use our site.
For more detailed information about the cookies that we and our partners serve through our website, please visit our cookie policy.

<br>
<strong>Using the Hotels.com mobile phone and tablet Apps (the “Mobile Apps”)</strong>
<br>
<br>When you use a Hotels.com Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.<br>
<br>In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps.
Specifically:<br>
<br>•    We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use.
This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App.
The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.<br>
<br>•    Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier (or "UID"), a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device.
We use this only on the first opening of the Mobile App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools.<br>
<br>•    When you use a Mobile App's ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, we use information about your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – to show hotels nearby.
We do not collect location data unless you expressly click on the ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, and you can switch off location data collection at any time through your phone settings menu.<br>
<br>•    Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs.
This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases.
As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred.
We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.<br>
<br>You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App sends to us.
You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device.
Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website.<br>
<br>
<strong>How we protect your information</strong>
<br>
<br>We want you to feel confident about using this website and our Apps to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.
While no website or App can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Children’s privacy</strong>
<br>
<br>This is a general audience website and neither the website nor any App offer services directed to children.
If we gain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to us without the parent’s or guardian’s consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.

<br>If you are visiting our website or using our Apps from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
By providing us with your personal information or using our services or our website, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and to those third parties with whom we share it, as described in this Privacy Policy.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
