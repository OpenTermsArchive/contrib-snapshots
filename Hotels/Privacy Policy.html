<strong>Cookies and other technologies</strong>
<br> Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).
This website uses cookies for the following general purposes:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.
For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.
We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Remember me." Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
Unless you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal information.</li>
<li>To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across the Internet.
For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
See <u>Display of Advertising/Your Choices</u> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>
<li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).</li>

Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.<br>

These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website.
Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.
By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer.

We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.
We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.<br>

<br>
<strong>Terms specific for mobile phone applications</strong>
<br> When you use Hotels.com mobile for iOS or Android (the “Application”) we collect and use your information in the same way and for the same purposes we do when you use our website.
We also collect and use the following additional information automatically from your use of the Application: <br>
<ul>
<li>The Application enables us to track the areas you access within the Application which allows us to refine the arrangement of content.  This information is collected anonymously and we cannot identify you from this.
The Application also records the phone’s unique device identifier (called a “UUID” for iPhones and the “device ID” for Android enabled phones).  We will only use the UUID/device ID on the first opening of the Application to confirm to various third parties that the Application has been downloaded and opened.</li>
<li>When you use our ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, we use available geo-location data – provided by your phone using GPS or similar technologies to determine your location in order to show hotels nearby.
Although this information is collected anonymously, this information may reveal to us your precise location.
We only use this information to find and display nearby hotels.
We do not collect location data unless you activate the ’find hotels near your current location’ feature within the Application.
Sharing of location data can be switched off at any time in the settings menu.</li>
</ul> If the Application encounters a problem and produces an error, the Application will send us information on this error so we can investigate the error and seek to improve the Application.
These error reports tell us information about the handset type and version, the UUID/device ID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred <br> If you do not wish us to collect and use this information via the Application in the ways set out above, please either disable this functionality (where the Application allows you to do so), or remove the Application from your handset and access our website.
<br> We look to optimize the Application for iPhone and Android to minimize the data usage <br>
<br>
