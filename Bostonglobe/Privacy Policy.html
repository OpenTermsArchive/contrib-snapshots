<b>1.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>The information we gather falls into two categories: </i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Personal information </b>is information that identifies you, such as your name, contact information, and credit card information.
We collect this information only when you choose to provide it to us.
For example, we collect personal information when you subscribe to the Boston Globe or email newsletters, place an order, complete a survey, register for one of our websites, or sign in to a website or mobile application through a third party tool such as Facebook Connect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Non-personal information</b> is information that our technology collects in aggregate, without identifying you.
Non-personal information includes your Internet connection, the device you use to access our websites, and tracking data relating to your use of our websites.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<i>We gather the following types of information:</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Contact &amp.
Demographic Information</b>: When you subscribe to The Boston Globe, register on a Boston Globe website or application, or participate in an optional promotion such as sweepstakes, contests, or special offers you will need to provide us with personal information such as your name, address, and email.
You must also provide some basic demographic information, such as your postal code, birth year, and gender.
For registration for promotions, special events, consumer panels, or surveys, we sometimes require information such as your household income, professional industry, and job title.
If you use our text messaging service, we collect the mobile phone number you use, the content of the messages you send to us, your wireless provider, and the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>
<b>Billing Information</b>: In order to subscribe, post a classified advertisement, or make a purchase, you must provide your credit card number or other billing information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Location Information</b>: If you use our mobile applications, you may choose to provide us with access to your precise geolocation information (such as information based on your GPS coordinates) so that we can deliver customized content to you based on your current location.
</p>
<p>
<b>Public Information</b>: You may create a public profile with us to comment on articles or share content on our forums or discussion groups (“Public Profile”).
You can learn about customizing, editing, deleting, and using your public profile here.
Please be careful when posting personal information, as this information may be read, collected, and used by others.
Third party companies offer services through which you can share information about your activities on our digital properties.
For example, Facebook Connect allows you to post information about your activities on Boston Globe properties to your Facebook profile page by “sharing” or “recommending” the content.</p>
<p>
<b>Usage Information</b>: We may log certain non-personal information about your use of the Boston Globe digital properties.
In addition, if you contact the Boston Globe, we may log information about the means through which you contacted us and our interaction with you.</p>
<p>
<b>Device Information</b>: We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device, or other device you use to access the Boston Globe digital properties.
This information may include your IP address, basic geolocation information (such as information based on your IP address), unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.</p>

(Your location information will be stored on your mobile device, unless you elect to have it saved to your search history and stored on Boston Globe servers.) If you contact the Boston Globe, we may collect information about our interaction with you.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>We allow third parties to gather information</b>.
Some of the services and advertisements on the Boston Globe properties are operated by third party companies, including service providers, analytics providers, and marketing partners, which may track certain non-personal information about our website users through cookies, web beacons, or other methods.
These third-parties gather this information for the purpose of understanding how users are using our sites, and making improvements to our sites.</p>
<p>- Social media features like the Facebook “like” button and login options such as those provided by Facebook and Google+ are operated by third parties.
The third parties operating these features may collect your IP address and information about the page(s) you visit on our sites, and they may set cookies to enable the features to function properly.

Please visit Blueconic’s privacy policy for details about its collection and use of information.</p>
<p>- A third party may also collect information about you when you interact with us via your mobile phone.
For instance, your wireless carrier enables text messaging and other services, and collects data about your mobile phone usage.
</p>
<p>- Some sections of our websites are operated by third parties.
For example, if you are searching for a job, you will be redirected to monster.com, which is framed within the boston.com website.
</p>

We do not have control over third party privacy practices.
