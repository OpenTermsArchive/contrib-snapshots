<p>Last Updated: August 18, 2016</p>
<p> This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to help you understand how Wayfair LLC and its affiliated brands, including Wayfair.com, Joss &amp.
Main, DwellStudio, AllModern, Birch Lane and Wayfair Supply ( "Wayfair", "we" or "us" ) collects and processes the information that you share when you use this and any of our websites (together, the "Site") and our mobile application (the "App," and together with the Site, the "Service").
</p>
<p>Before submitting information to the Service, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.
By using or accessing the Service, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
If you prefer that we not collect and process information about you, please do not provide it to us and do not access the Service.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
If Wayfair learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted Personal Information (defined below) online without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete the information as soon as possible and to not use such information for any purpose, except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law.
If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us here.
</p>
<p> Information We Collect
</p>
<p> We collect the following information, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Personal Information You Share With Us:</strong> "Personal Information" is information that can personally identify you, such as your name, email address and telephone number.
We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may retain it as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Service.
Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the Service.
Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice.
If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Service.
and </li>
<li>
<strong>Information We Collect Automatically:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may automatically collect identifier and other technical information, such as your browser information, operating system information, device information, TCP-IP address and the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your visits to the Service (“Online Information”).

</p>
<p> If you register to use the Service, we may collect Personal Information including your name, email address, and telephone number.
</p>
<p> You may also register for the Service using another service, such as Facebook.
If you create your Wayfair account by connecting through another service, you are authorizing us to use public information from that connected account to help complete your Wayfair profile.
Please remember that the manner in which the service uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of such service.
We recommend that you review the terms and policies of that service, including its privacy and data gathering practices.
Wayfair shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party service provider or any other third-party site or service that may be enabled within the Service.
</p>
<p> You may review, update, or modify your account information, including profile and contact information, at any time by logging into your Wayfair account.
You may also permanently delete your account by contacting us here.
</p>
<p> Online Identification Tools
</p>
<p> Like many website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and provide a better web experience.
Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather Online Information.
</p>
<p> We use web beacons (a.k.a.
clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags) to personalize your experience of the Service and to generate information about Service traffic and trends.
Web beacons collect Online Information, such as the type of browser that you use and your IP address.
Web beacons may be used alone or in conjunction with cookies.
when web beacons are used with cookies, they may link Online Information to other Personal Information that you have provided to us.
Web beacons usually are not visible to you.
</p>
<p> We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes like personalizing the Service.
A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your computer.
A "session cookie" stores temporary information that is erased when you close your web browser or turn off your computer.
A "persistent cookie" enables the Service to recognize you when you return to it and remains stored on your computer until you delete it.
Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies.
If you set your browser to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your account or to personalize the content that you see.
A "flash cookie," also known as a "local storage object," is not stored in your browser, unlike other cookies, and instead placed on your computer by websites that use Adobe Flash.
You may disable flash cookies via your Flash Player preferences or by using third-party software.
We do not and cannot use cookies to gather other information that may be stored on your hard drive.
</p>
<p> Third-party advertising management partners may help us display tailored content to our customers’ interests and serve interest-based advertising on our behalf.
Wayfair and our advertising management partners may use cookies, web beacons and other tools to collect Online Information about your activities on the Service, to deliver advertising on the Service or elsewhere on the Internet based upon your interests that may be more relevant to you and to measure effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the Service.
In particular, Wayfair may use Google Analytics to monitor activity on the Site and assist with advertising.
To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at  www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.
</p>
<p> You may "opt out" of receiving some interest-based advertisements by following the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
(An "opt-out cookie" will be placed on your computer indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.
If you delete cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again.) You may opt out of certain interest-based advertisements that use Wayfair.com's cookie by clicking here.
You may opt out of certain interest-based advertisements that use AllModern.com's cookie by clicking here.
You may opt out of certain interest-based advertisements that use JossandMain.com's cookie by clicking here.
You may opt out of certain interest-based advertisements that use BirchLane.com's cookie by clicking here.
To learn more about cookies in general, including how to manage and delete cookies, visit www.aboutads.info.
</p>
<p> Opting out of receiving interest-based advertisements through the links above does not mean you will no longer see digital advertisements from Wayfair or our ad management partners.
rather, opting out means that most of the digital advertisements that you do see will not be based on your particular interests.
In addition, certain data collection tools on the Service (including cookies) still may collect information about your use of the Service, such as for analytics and fraud prevention.
</p>
<p> How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
</p>
<p> Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many digital service operators, including Wayfair, do not recognize or respond to DNT signals.
</p>
<p> Third Party Features
</p>
<p> The Service also may include an activity feed, social media buttons and widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button or the "Share This" button.
These features may collect and display your Personal Information, your IP address and the page you are visiting on the Service and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Service and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of the third party that provides the feature.
</p>
<p> Use of Service via Mobile Device
</p>
<p> If you use the Service through your mobile device, we may collect your geo-location information to assist us in fulfilling your order.
We will not share this information with third parties and will only use this information for the sole purpose of fulfilling your order.
You may at any time prevent the Service from using your location by turning this option off at the device level.
</p>
<p> When you use the Service through your mobile device, we also collect device type and UUID, a unique identifier generated within the App, and store this information in log files.
We use this information to provide you with the most up to date application and features, or to advertise or promote products or services to you that are applicable to your device type.
</p>
<p> Third-Party Links
</p>
<p> We may provide links to third-party websites that we do not own or control.
We are not responsible for the information collection practices of any website that we do not own or control.
We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of third-party websites before providing any information to or through them.

</p>
<p> Wayfair employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, serving ads on our behalf, providing search results and links, and processing credit card payments.
These third-party service providers have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but may not use it for any other purpose.

</p>
<p> In the event that a store, division or part or all of Wayfair (or the assets of a Wayfair entity) is bought, sold or otherwise transferred, or is in the process of a potential transaction, customer information will likely be shared for evaluation purposes and included among the transferred business assets.

<p>When Will My Order Arrive?</p>
<p> Every product on our site has an estimated Lead Time - the number of business days it takes for an item to be processed and prepared for shipment at the warehouse.
To provide you with the greatest selection on the internet, we ship from warehouses all over the country.
Each lead time varies based on many different factors.
Some warehouses stock items that can be shipped the same day or within 24 hours.
Other items require a longer time (e.g.
2-4 weeks).
Each product page on our site includes the estimated Lead Time, "Usually ships in ________ ," to give you an idea how quickly your order will leave the warehouse.
</p>
<p> For Small Parcel shipments within the United States, delivery usually takes between 1 and 6 business days (except for USPS which ships in 1-10 business days) after your order is picked up from the warehouse.
For expedited services such as 3-day, 2nd Day or Next Day Air, your order's travel time is locked in to the given speed you select after the item leaves the warehouse.
You should remember that the estimated Lead Time still applies before the item ships out.
Be sure to consult the product's Lead Time before you order with expedited shipping, and call us if you have any questions or concerns.
</p>
<p> For Large Parcel Curbside Deliveries, delivery usually takes between 3-6 business days from the time your items leave the warehouse (5-10 business days for Canadian shipments).

For commercial deliveries, no appointment will be made.
