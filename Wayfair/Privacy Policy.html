Rewards Dollars will be issued in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the net amount paid for the Transaction, regardless of method of payment.
If the net amount paid for the original Transaction changes for any reason, whether due to a subsequent change in products purchased or otherwise, any associated Reward Dollars will be adjusted to reflect the modified net amount paid for the Transaction.
Rewards Dollars will be credited to a Member's account within ten (10) days of the closing of each qualifying Transaction.
All dollar amounts are rounded down.
Rewards Dollars are earned on the net US dollar amount paid on the Transaction, and will be in the form of a credit in US currency that can be applied to another future Transaction.
The "net amount" shall mean the cash amount paid by the Member for the product(s) purchased in connection with the Transaction, excluding any payment of applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges and after applying any discounts or other credits.
Rewards Dollars are not earned on any discounted dollar amounts, applicable taxes, shipping and handling charges, returns, credits, purchases of gift cards and/or gift certificates, or purchases in whole or in part with Rewards Dollars.
No Rewards Dollars will be earned for any activities prior to enrollment.
Rewards Dollars are not valid for cash or cash equivalents.
</p>
<p> Redemption of Rewards Dollars.
Rewards Dollars can be only redeemed and applied as a credit against the purchase price of a Transaction.
In order to redeem Rewards Dollars, you must either enter the promotional code assigned to you for such redemption when you confirm the Transaction or, if available, check the applicable box during the checkout process on any Participating Sites.
Rewards Dollars are not redeemable for cash or cash equivalent and may not be applied toward payment of any outstanding Wayfair account balances or previous purchases.
Rewards Dollars may not be combined with other Wayfair promotions, offers, or other discounts.
Except in the case of valid returns as specified below, no credits or refunds will be issued for any reason after Rewards Dollars have been redeemed, including for unused Rewards Dollars.
</p>
<p> Returns.

</p>
<p> Non-Transferability and Non-Aggregation of Rewards Dollars.
Rewards Dollars and any other right, obligation or benefit of the Rewards Program may not be transferred, assigned, sold, traded or bartered by any Member or any other person, without Wayfair's prior written consent, which Wayfair may withhold in its sole discretion, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be null and void.
In addition, Rewards Dollars are for the Member's personal use only.
Members may not aggregate Rewards Dollars from multiple accounts or use Rewards Dollars for the purpose of purchasing products from the Participating Sites on behalf of others or for the purpose of reselling such products to others.
</p>

In addition, you may cancel your participation in the Rewards Program by calling the following toll-free number 1-877-WAYFAIR and/or sending an email to service@wayfair.com, in which case Wayfair reserves the right to revoke any and all Rewards Dollars earned.
You may re-enroll in the Rewards Program, however, previously earned Rewards Dollars that were revoked will not be credited and you will start with a balance of zero Rewards Dollars.
</p>
<p> Other Conditions of Participation Participation in and benefits to the Rewards Program are offered at the sole discretion of Wayfair and Wayfair reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to limit, suspend, cancel, discontinue, terminate, change, amend or modify the Rewards Program and its Terms of Use, in whole or in part, at any time and without notice to Rewards Program Members (including, but not limited to, our right to terminate Rewards Dollars, adjust the amount of Rewards Dollars earned for each net dollar in purchases made, modify reward levels or reward benefits, or change program benefits, partners, conditions of participation, rules for earning, redeeming, or forfeiting Rewards Dollars, or other rules governing the use of rewards).
