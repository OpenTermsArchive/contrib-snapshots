When you visit our Website, the cookies allow our Website to recognize you and your browser and allow your use of the website and its functionalities to be tracked.
This information can be used for a number of purposes, including serving you with advertising that is more aligned to you and your interests.
Cookies are useful because they help us make your Website experience more enjoyable.

(all of this data segmentation is anonymous).

<b>ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO EEA RESIDENTS</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is our justification for handling your personal data?</b>
</p>
<p>Under European data protection laws, we have to ensure that we process your personal information fairly and lawfully.
This means that we must have a "legal basis" for each of our processing activities where they relate to the personal data of an individual within the EEA.
These bases include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Consent</b> – we may decide to obtain your specific, freely given consent to one or more processing activities.
</li>
<li>
<b>Legal obligation</b> – we may need to process your data where it is necessary to comply with applicable laws that we are subject to.
</li>
<li>
<b>Performance of a contract</b> – we may process your data if we are entering into a contract with you, or taking preparatory steps to do so.
</li>
<li>
<b>Legitimate interests</b> – we may process your personal data where we believe that we have a legitimate interest in doing so, and we have analyzed this and determined that our interests are not overridden by the impact on your rights and freedoms under data protection law.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We rely on these legal bases in different ways, and in relation to different types of processing of your personal data.
</p>
<p>
<i>Consent</i>

</li>
<li> For marketing, market research and business development.

</li>
</ol>
<p>If we rely on our, or another person's, legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a <i>balancing test</i> to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection.
You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the "Complaints, Questions and Comments" section below.
</p>
<p>We process your personal information collected through the use of Non-Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of our legitimate interests.
