<p>Airbnb recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations.
Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p>
<p>

Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you.
This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Airbnb regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Airbnb on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.</p>
<p>
<b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b>
</p>
<p>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts
<br>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Airbnb in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled.
When a booking is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest’s Airbnb Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also “friends” or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that the Guest provided to Airbnb when the Guest became a Member matches the name that the Guest provided to the SNSs to which the Guest has linked his or her Airbnb Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking.
If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of an Accommodation within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Airbnb for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released.
When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Airbnb will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Accommodation Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Accommodation Fees and Guest Fees.
The Accommodation Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “<b>Total Fees</b>”.
The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host’s Accommodation are the “<b>Accommodation Fees</b>”.
Please note that it is the Host and not Airbnb which determines the Accommodation Fees.
The Accommodation Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Host’s discretion.</p>
<p>Airbnb charges a fee to Guests based upon a percentage of applicable Accommodation Fees which are the “<b>Guest Fees</b>”.
The Guest Fees are added to the Accommodation Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing.
Airbnb will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e.
when the Host confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less Airbnb’s Host Fees (defined below)) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest).</p>
<p>Appointment of Airbnb as Payment Agent for Host
<br>Each Host hereby appoints Airbnb as the Host’s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Guests on behalf of the Host.
Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest to Airbnb shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the Accommodation available to Guest in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees.
Each Host agrees that, Airbnb may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.
In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Airbnb assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>
<p>Please note that Airbnb does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.
However, you acknowledge and agree that Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings.
Please note that Airbnb will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p>
<p>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests
<br>The Hosts, not Airbnb, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services.
If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host.
You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Airbnb, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Airbnb is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Airbnb disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.
You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Airbnb is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Airbnb acts as the Host’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host.
Upon your payment of amounts to Airbnb which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is extinguished, and Airbnb is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Airbnb’s Host Fees, to the Host.
In the event that Airbnb does not remit any such amounts to a Host, such Host will have recourse only against Airbnb.</p>
<p>Listings for Accommodations will specify the Total Fees.
As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Airbnb in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled.
If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e.
not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Airbnb will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
<p>You agree to pay Airbnb for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Airbnb Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host.
In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Airbnb, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g.
one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit card.
Once Airbnb receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Airbnb will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing.
Please note that Airbnb cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Airbnb’s collection of the Total Fees, and Airbnb disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Airbnb or its third party payment processor.
You agree to pay Airbnb for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Airbnb Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application – e.g.
by PayPal or credit card.
You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Airbnb or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application.
You also authorize Airbnb to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under “Damage to Accommodations” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable.
If you are directed to Airbnb’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices.
Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.
Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>
<p>
<b>Security Deposits</b>
</p>
<p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“<b>Security Deposits</b>”).
Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation.
If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of Accommodation, Airbnb will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest’s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Guest’s check-in at the applicable Host’s Accommodation.
Airbnb will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Airbnb is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>
<b>Service Fees</b>
</p>
<p>In consideration for providing the Services, Airbnb collects service fees from Hosts and Guests (“<b>Service Fees</b>”).
Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Guest Fees and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Host based upon a percentage of the amount of the Accommodation Fees (“<b>Host Fees</b>”).
Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Host Fees.
Host Fees are deducted from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the Accommodation Fees to the Host, within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation.
Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
<br>Balances will be remitted by Airbnb to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services.
Please note that for any payments by Airbnb in currencies other than U.S.
dollars, Airbnb may deduct foreign currency processing costs from such payments.
More information on foreign currency processing cost deductions will be available via the Site and Application.
More information on Services Fees can be found at HYPERLINK "http://www.airbnb.com/help/topic/hosting" http://www.airbnb.com/help/topic/hosting.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p>
<b>General Booking and Financial Terms</b>
</p>
<p>Cancellations and Refunds
<br>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Airbnb will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time.
If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation.
Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy.
Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application.</p>
<p>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Airbnb will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Airbnb containing alternative Listings and other related information.
If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest’s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Airbnb the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms.
If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Airbnb, please contact Airbnb at http://www.airbnb.com/home/contact.</p>
<p>Recurring Payments
<br>In some instances, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, “<b>Recurring Payments</b>”).
More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable.
If Recurring Payments apply to your payment obligations for Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking, you authorize Airbnb, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, identified on the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>Donations
<br>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity.
We do not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for, whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</p>
<p>Taxes
<br>IRS regulation, regarding federal tax reporting requirements, stipulates that Airbnb must collect IRS Form W-9 from all property owners in the United States.
You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors.
Airbnb cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site, Application and Services.
Additionally, please note that each Host is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings.
Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, Airbnb may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency
<br>As part of the Services, Airbnb provides a feature through which Members may view Total Fees for various Listings in foreign currencies.
You understand and agree that these views of Total Fees are for informational purposes only and are not the official Total Fees for the Listings.
If you (as a Guest) request a booking, you will be notified of the currency in which you will be charged together with the corresponding amount of Total Fees, if your booking is confirmed by a Host.
The currency in which you will be charged will be determined by Airbnb based on the payment method you select and the location of the Accommodation in the Listing you are booking.
If the currency in which you will be charged is different from the currency chosen by the Host to receive payment, Airbnb will be responsible for the required currency conversion processing, including the costs thereof, which will be calculated based on the most current applicable foreign exchange rate that Airbnb has uploaded to the Site as of the date and time that your booking is confirmed (the “<b>Applicable Exchange Rate</b>”).
You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) although Airbnb updates the Applicable Exchange Rate on a regular basis, it does not update such rate on a real-time basis.
and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate.
For the avoidance of doubt, Airbnb will retain any profits (and will bear any losses) that result from such currency conversion processing due to changes in the applicable foreign exchange rate between the date your booking is confirmed and the date Airbnb makes payment to a Host.</p>
<p>Damage to Accommodations
<br>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived.
You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation.
In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to, photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.
After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Airbnb Account.
Airbnb also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Airbnb Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Airbnb in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Airbnb’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Airbnb Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Airbnb to Hosts.
If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to Airbnb (if applicable).</p>
<p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Airbnb Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb or a representative of Airbnb regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services.
If you are a Guest, upon Airbnb’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Airbnb or a third party selected by Airbnb, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Airbnb under the Airbnb Host Guarantee.</p>
<p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including amounts paid by Airbnb under the Airbnb Host Guarantee.) You agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Airbnb may reasonably request to assist Airbnb in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Airbnb otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Airbnb submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Airbnb will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<p>Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Airbnb will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
