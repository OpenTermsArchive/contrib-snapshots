<ul><li>Your public profile page, which includes your profile photo, first name, description, and city.</li><li>Listing pages that include information such as the Accommodation or Experience’s approximate or precise location description, calendar availability, profile photo, aggregated demand information (like page views over a period of time), and additional information you choose to share.</li><li>Reviews, ratings and other public feedback.</li><li>Content in a community or discussion forum, blog or social media post.</li></ul>
<p>We may display parts of your public profile and other Content you make available to the public like Listing details on third-party sites, platforms and apps.</p>

<p><strong>4.4 Host Service Providers</strong>.</p>
<p>Hosts may use third-party services to help manage or deliver their services, such as cleaning services or lock providers. Hosts may use features on the Airbnb Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number) with such third-party service providers.</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Complying with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protecting our Rights</strong>.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with a valid legal request or to respond to claims asserted against Airbnb, (iii) to respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation to address alleged or suspected illegal activity, or to respond to or address any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal or regulatory liability (more information on Airbnb’s Law Enforcement Guidelines <a href="/help/article/960/how-does-airbnb-respond-to-data-requests-from-law-enforcement">here</a>), (iv) to enforce and administer our <a href="/terms">agreements</a> with Members, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Airbnb, its employees, its Members, or members of the public. For example, if permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, Host tax information may be shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon or harm to Airbnb, our Members, or expose Airbnb to a claim of obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>For jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and remittance of Taxes where legally permissible according to applicable law, we may disclose Hosts’ and Guests’ information about transactions, bookings, Accommodations and occupancy Taxes to the applicable tax authority, such as Host and Guest names, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by Hosts from Guests, and contact information.</p>
<p>In jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates or requires a registration, notification, permit, or license application of a Host with a local governmental authority through Airbnb in accordance with local law, we may share information of participating Hosts with the relevant authority, both during the application process and, periodically thereafter, such as the Host’s full name and contact details, Accommodation address, tax identification number, Listing details, and number of nights booked.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 Programs with Managers and Owners</strong>.</p>
<p>We may share personal information of Hosts and Guests such as booking information, and information related to compliance with applicable laws such as short-term rental laws with landlords, management companies, and/or property owners (the “<strong>Building Management</strong>”), in order to facilitate programs with Building Management. For example, guest booking and personal information, including guest contact information, may be shared with the Building Management of the building, complex, or community where a host lives and/or the listing is located, to facilitate hosting services, compliance with applicable laws, security, billing, and other services.</p>
<p><strong>4.7 Host Information Provided to Airbnb for Work Customers</strong>.</p>
<p>If a booking is designated as being for business or work purpose and (1) is made by a Guest affiliated with an Enterprise, (2) the Enterprise is enrolled in Airbnb for Work, we may disclose information related to the booking to the Enterprise (e.g., name of the Host, Accommodation address, booking dates, Listing details, etc.) to the extent necessary for the adequate performance of Airbnb’s contract with the Enterprise and to provide the services. At the request of the Enterprise or the Guest, we may also share this information with third parties engaged by the Enterprise to provide support services.</p>
<p><strong>4.8 Service Providers</strong>.</p>
<p>We share personal information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers to help us run our business, including service providers that help us: (i) verify your identity or authenticate your identification documents, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) conduct background or police checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, (iv) perform product development, maintenance and debugging, (v) allow the provision of the Airbnb Services through third-party platforms and software tools (e.g. through the integration with our APIs), (vi) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services, (vii) process, handle or assess insurance claims or similar claims, or (viii) facilitate non-profit and charitable activities consistent with Airbnb’s mission. These providers are contractually bound to protect your personal information and have access to your personal information to perform these tasks.</p>

In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>4.10 Corporate Affiliates</strong>.</p>

Occasionally we may need to manually review communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications to send third-party marketing messages to you and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</p>
