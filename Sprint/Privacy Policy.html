<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: Our privacy policy has been updated to reflect that Sprint will be introducing two new programs: 1) Mobile Advertising – to make the mobile ads you see on your device more relevant to you (You must opt in to this program) and 2) Reporting &amp.

We will not share any information that identifies you personally under either of these new programs.
For detailed information on these programs and to learn how to opt in or out, please visit sprint.com/privacy.<br>(En Español)</p> Sprint Nextel Privacy Policy <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Sprint Nextel ("Sprint") will collect, access, use or disclose your personal information.
It applies to all of our products, services, and web sites ("Services").

For example, we may have a separate policy or agreement for certain products, services or brands.
Our collection, access, use, disclosure and safeguarding of your personal information is subject to U.S.

We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you use our Services.
We may collect information about your device such as the type, version of operating system, signal strength, whether it is on and how it is functioning, as well as information about how you use the device and services available through it, such as your call and data usage and history, your location, web sites you have visited, applications purchased, applications downloaded or used, and other similar information.

These third party cookies or tools are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads and are not subject to this Policy.

The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users.
You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us.
If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services.

For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services.
Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies.

You may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications.
