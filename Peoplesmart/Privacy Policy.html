This privacy policy is for visitors and registered users ("you") of PeopleSmart.com (the "website" or "service"), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc.
(“Inflection”, "we" or "our"): </p>
<p> This policy discusses what information the site collects, how we use it, and the limited circumstances in which we may share it.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
</p> What is covered by this privacy policy? <p> This privacy policy covers PeopleSmart.com, which is designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others.
This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
Visit GoodHire.com for all your employment screening needs.
</p> What isn’t covered by this policy? <p> This privacy policy only applies to information collected by this website, which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc.
This policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains that this site links to, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.

<p> If you want to submit an opt-out request to remove yourself from the search results of this and other people search sites we operate, please click here.
We will try our best to honor it.
</p>
<p> If you choose to opt out of search results, that choice may affect the visibility of the relevant information on our entire network of sites, which includes this website, Identity.com, and other affiliated properties.
We try our best to honor your request, but our opt-out system is not perfect and it may miss records that don’t perfectly match the information you submit.
</p> Your Public Records Exist Elsewhere In The World – We Do Not Control Them <p> This site displays public records that are available in the real world, such as criminal history records from law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy records from courts.
Original copies of public records can only be changed by those entities.

Please note that exercising the opt-out option will not actually delete or change the original copies of such records.

</p> User Data Supplementation <p> We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.
This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.
If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
Please see the “What This Policy Covers”.
</p> Your safety and privacy are very important to us <p> We want to minimize the risk of harm resulting from use of public records information.
