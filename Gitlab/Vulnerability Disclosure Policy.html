<p>GitLab protects your data with encryption in transit and at rest, providing organization-wide protection mechanism such as SAML SSO and enforced 2FA.</p>
Security of GitLab as an Open-Source Product
<p>GitLab CE is open source and has over 2,000 contributors.
This means there have been over 2,000 pairs of eyes looking at the GitLab CE source code.
GitLab EE is open-core, which means the source code is also open for inspection to our customers.</p>
Privacy
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of your data, preventing it from unauthorized access.</p>
GitLab's Access to Your Private Repositories
<p>GitLab Support will never access private repositories unless required for support reasons and only when requested by the owner of the repository via a support ticket.
When working a support issue we strive to respect your privacy as much as possible.
Once we've verified account ownership, we will only access the files and settings needed to resolve your issue.
Support may sign into your account to access configurations but we will limit the scope of our review to the minimal required to solve your issue.
In the event we need to pull a clone of your code, we will only do so with your consent.
All cloned repositories are deleted as soon as the support issue has been resolved.
There are two exceptions to this policy: we have determined that there has been a violation of our terms of service or if we are compelled as part of a legal matter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Guidelines for shell commands in the GitLab codebase</li>
<li>For community contributions, we enforce style guides</li>
<li>In addition, both for community contributions and for internal development, we use brakeman and RuboCop run by GitLab CI.</li>
<li>We engage security experts to do white box testing such as fault injection (manual), penetration testing (manual) and vulnerabilities testing (both automatic, and manual)</li>
</ul>
<p>GitLab also has a responsible disclosure program.</p>
External Testing
<p>GitLab's on-premises product as well as GitLab.com SaaS is subjected to security
tests regularly through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug reporting program through direct email, or HackerOne.
For more details on
this, please see the page on responsible disclosure.</li>
<li>A combination of third party white box, grey box, and pen testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grimm carries out a black box
assessment of GitLab and GitLab.com annually and the last assessment was performed in Q3 of 2019.
Their report is available for
(prospective) enterprise customers by emailing <code>security@gitlab.com</code>.</p>
<p>Given that penetration testing and other simulated events are frequently indistinguishable from real life attack activities and have the potential to impact performance and site reliability, we do not permit customers, prospective customers, or members of the larger GitLab community to conduct penetration tests and vulnerability scans to or originating from the GitLab.com environment without explicit approval from GitLab's Security Team.</p>
<p>To request authorization for penetration testing to or originating from any GitLab resource, please email security@gitlab.com.
If you have hired a third-party to conduct your testing, you must follow the same process and then notify your third-party company when we grant approval.
GitLab will not grant approval to a third-party testing company.</p>
<p>If you are a GitLab customer or prospective customer, please reach out to your GitLab Sales Account Representative and have them submit the request on your behalf.</p>
<p>Again, explicit permission from GitLab's Security Team is required for all penetration tests.</p>
Business Continuity Plan
<p>GitLab, by its remote-only nature, is not easily affected by typical causes of business disruption, such as local failures of equipment, power supplies, telecommunications, social unrest, terrorist attacks, fire, or natural disasters.</p>
<p>The detailed business continuity plan is documented in the BuinessOps section of this handbook.</p>
Data Breach Notification Policy
<p>This policy defines what qualifies as a breach of user data, what actions will be
taken in the event of user data exposure or compromise, and the timeline for
action.</p>
<p>This policy applies to user data stored on GitLab.com and GitLab Hosted (GitHost).
It does not apply to self-managed / on-premises GitLab instances or instances hosted with other
providers than GitLab.com and GitLab Hosted.</p>
Data Classification - What information is covered by this policy
<p>This policy covers "private user data" stored by GitLab.com and GitLab Hosted,
and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private git Repositories</li>
<li>Private Wikis, Issues, and Merge Requests</li>
<li>Encrypted Passwords</li>
<li>Private Email Addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: GitLab.com and GitLab Hosted do not store any "personally identifiable information"
(PII) such as (i) Private Addresses, (ii) Credit Card Numbers, (iii) Bank
Account Information, (iv) ID numbers (e.g.
passport, driver's license, social
security, national identification, etc.).
GitLab.com and GitLab Hosted also do not store
any "personal health information" (PHI).
Therefore, laws and regulations
relating to PII and PHI do not apply.</p>
What qualifies as a breach
<p>A breach of user data is the unintended or accidental exposure of private user
data.
This can be caused by accidents, misconfigurations, or malicious actions
performed by an external attacker or team member.</p>
<p>An event is considered a data breach when there is evidence that private user data
has been exposed to the public or to an untrusted third party.</p>
<p>Trusted third parties may have authorized access to user data under a signed
Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Such trusted third parties include but are not
limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud service providers</li>
<li>Database consultants</li>
<li>Security auditors</li>
<li>Financial auditors</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of a user data breach would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compromise of a database server that contains private user data with evidence
that an attacker may have had access to or copied the data off-site.</li>
<li>Compromise of an application server account that has access to private user data
and evidence that the attacker has downloaded or accessed private data.</li>
<li>Theft of a device known to contain private user data.</li>
<li>Web application attack used to download a list of all user emails and encrypted
passwords.</li>
</ul>What is not considered a breach
<p>Examples of security incidents that would not be considered a breach of private
user data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compromise of an application server that does not contain or have access to
private user data.</li>
<li>Compromise of a team member application account that does not have access to
private user data.</li>
<li>Malware infection on a server or team member computer system that does not
contain private user data.</li>
<li>Compromise of non-sensitive user data such as login IP addresses, login history,
project permissions.</li>
<li>Unintentional disclosure of project names, group names, issue titles, or
project or user metadata unless this data can cause damage to the user or their
business.</li>
<li>Discovery of a vulnerability that could have been used to compromise
private data, but for which there is no evidence of exploitation.</li>
<li>Theft of a team member's mobile device that does not contain private user
data.</li>
<li>Theft of a team member's private keys, tokens, or other credentials provided
there is no evidence they were used to access private user data.</li>
</ul>Who will be notified in the event of a data breach
<p>If GitLab has detected evidence of a breach of GitLab.com or GitLab Hosted private
user data, all affected users will be notified via the configured email address
for their accounts.
Emails will contain information on what data was exposed or
compromised, when, and for how long (to the extent this information is available).</p>
<p>For a breach that exposes private data for a large number of users, the public will
also be informed via the configured email addresses for their accounts, and
additional means of communication will be considered (e.g.
press release, the
blog, etc.) on a case by case basis.</p>
Notification timing
<p>GitLab will endeavor to notify users within 24 hours of breach discovery.
This
may be delayed when necessary to comply with requests by law enforcement.</p>
