In these cases, your personal data is handled according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Contests, sweepstakes and promotions</b>
We may sponsor contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (any, a "Promotion, and collectively, "Promotions").
If you choose to participate in a Promotion, you may be required to provide certain Personal Information.
By participating in a Promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion.

These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
<p>
<b>What is 123Greetings.com's practice regarding IP addresses?</b>
We collect and analyze traffic on our website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors.
IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet.
An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally.
However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.</p>
<p>123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website.
This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard.
This limits your ability to communicate anonymously using ecards.
Ecards are not intended for anonymous communications, and such activity is expressly prohibited by our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
<b>What does 123Greetings.com do with the ecard messages &amp.
information?</b>
When you send one of our ecards, the information you provide to us is used to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an e-mail to the recipient.
We treat our ecards as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and the contents will not be disclosed to anyone other than the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online ecards you send.
Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network.
Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an ecard or to verify that an ecard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the ecard, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message.</p>
<p>If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>
<p>
<b>Third Party Ad Advertising </b>
123Greetings or its advertisers may use third party ad networks and ad serving companies to help sell and present advertisements online in connection with the Website.
These third party ad companies may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness and to compile anonymous statistics about 123Greetings users.
The use of these technologies by these third party ad companies is subject to their own privacy policies, not 123Greetings's.
These third party ad companies may also monitor 123Greetings for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisements, "click-throughs" and/or other activities.</p>
<p>123Greetings does not provide advertisers access to any personally identifiable information that you have provided to 123Greetings (keeping in mind that anything you have elected to share publicly on the site is available to everyone to see).</p>
<p>123Greetings does not control the information collection, use, or sharing practices of third party analytics providers or advertisers.
Some of these parties may collect your Personal Information when you access the Platforms or other online websites and services.</p>
<p>While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
You may want to visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members.
You may also want to visit or https://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an "opt-out" by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program.</p>
<p>
<b>Social &amp.
interactive features.
Public information</b>
The website may provide you the opportunity to interact between the website and a third party website (such as social media platforms) and post content publicly through interactive features and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums").
You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post photographs (which may include metadata), videos, questions, comments, suggestions or other content (collectively, "User Content").
Please note that certain information, such as your name and other Personal Information, may be publicly displayed on the Platforms along with your User Content.</p>
<p>Anything you post to a Community Forum is public -- others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties.
Information or other content you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others.
If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information, that information will be considered public information and this Privacy Notice will not apply to such information.
If you submit User Content, it may be published online or offline at any time.
In addition, we may use your User Content and any excerpt from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.</p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third party providers of Social Features that interact with our website.
For example, if you choose to use Social Features, you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information, related to your use of the third party website or interactive service.
The third party website or interactive service may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or service, but we may retain the information previously collected in accordance with respective third-party privacy policies.
In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website, feature or application give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your posts, your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a third party social media website, feature or application.
The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Notice.
The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party website or service.</p>
<p>
<b>Import Contacts</b>
The website may also allow you to import information about yourself or third parties from a third-party website or interactive service.
For example, the website may allow you to provide your login information to your email account to enable the website to import your contacts or list of persons with whom you have communicated.
By providing the login information in your account in any such situation, you are consenting to 123Greetings, or a party on behalf of 123Greetings, importing your contacts or list of persons with whom you have communicated for using with the website.
Unless you consent, we will not store the password you provide if you import your contacts from a third party source.</p>
<p>
<b>Your Control over Your Information</b>
123Greetings may provide functionality on some Platforms to update your contact information and/or preferences through a "My Account" (or similar) section.
If you submit a request to update your contact information, 123Greetings will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.
Note, however, that information may persist internally for 123Greetings’ administrative purposes and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
Please also note that if you are the user of one of our Apps, you may be able to review and update your Personal Information or preferences only through the website associated with that App.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those e-mails.
Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the website and these transactional messages may be unaffected if you opt-out from marketing communications.</p>
<p>To opt-out of receiving direct mail, you may contact us through Customer Support at support@123greetings.com.<br>
Note: Because mailings often are prepared well in advance you may, for a period of time, continue to receive some offers after you send us your request.</p>
<p>
