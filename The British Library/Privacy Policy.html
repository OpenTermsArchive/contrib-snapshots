 Privacy Policy <p>At the British Library, <em>we</em> care about the privacy of the people who use <em>our Services,</em> and this <em>Policy</em> explains how <em>we</em> deal with <em>your personal information</em> in relation to <em>our Services.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>We</em> explain many of the terms used in this <em>Policy</em> on <em>our</em> Definitions page – defined terms are shown in italics.</p>
<p>Depending upon <em>your</em> relationship with <em>us, we</em> may also provide you with additional <em>Service</em> specific information about <em>our</em> use of your <em>personal information</em> which should be read alongside this <em>Policy.</em> Specific details relating to <em>our Services</em> can be found on the Our Services page.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>1.            What type of information does the British Library collect about you?</strong>
<p>1.1          <em>We</em> may collect certain <em>personal information</em> which (either on its own or when combined with other information <em>we</em> hold about <em>you</em>) allows <em>us</em> to identify <em>you</em> as an individual and which is about <em>you</em>.
<em>You</em> can see details of the types of <em>personal information</em>
<em>we</em> may collect on the Personal Information page.</p>
<p>1.2          <em>We</em> will normally collect <em>personal information</em> directly from <em>you</em> when <em>you</em> volunteer it to <em>us</em> or from <em>your</em> use of <em>our Services</em>.
Normally, <em>we</em> try to limit <em>our</em> use of information which allows <em>us</em> to identify you as a named individual to the details <em>we</em> need to provide the requested or agreed <em>Service</em> for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>1.3          Where possible, <em>we</em> collect and use details which do not identify you as a named individual, such as website usage information, aggregated information and statistics and other details of how <em>you</em> use <em>our</em> online content and <em>Services</em>.
Some of this information may involve the use of cookies and web beacons.
Please see the <strong>Depersonalised &amp.
Anonymous Information</strong> section below, as well as our Cookie Policy for more information.</p>
<p>1.4          However, <em>we</em> may also collect information from and/or combine <em>your personal information</em> with information from other sources.
<em>We</em> only do this where lawful to do so and where it helps the Library to provide efficient, relevant Services to <em>our</em> users.
<em>You</em> can find more details about other such sources on the Data Collection page.</p>
<p>1.5          <em>We</em> do not normally collect any <em>sensitive personal information</em> from or about <em>you</em> and do not wish to do so unless essential.
<em>You</em> can find more details about such situations on the Personal Information page.</p>
<p>1.6          <em>We</em> may store <em>your personal information</em> in electronic and/or hard copy format.</p>
<p>1.7          To understand why <em>we</em> collect and further use <em>your personal information</em> please see the <strong>Why does the British Library use your personal information</strong> section below.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>2.            How does the British Library collect your personal information?</strong>
<p>2.1          The <em>Policy</em> applies to any <em>personal information</em>
<em>we</em> collect through <em>our data collection media.</em> See the Data Collection page for more details.</p>
<p>2.2          <em>We</em> collect <em>your personal information</em> through <em>our data collection media</em> whenever <em>you</em> use any of <em>our Services</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>3.            Why does the British Library use your personal information?</strong>
<p>3.1          The <em>Library</em> may use <em>your personal information</em> for a variety of purposes, depending upon the <em>Service</em> you have requested or are using.
This will normally simply be to do what <em>you</em> have requested, such as to deal with <em>your</em> enquiry, give <em>you</em> access to the <em>Library</em>, provide a requested book to <em>you</em>, or send <em>you</em> tickets to an event.</p>
<p>3.2          Other uses of <em>personal information</em> will be to ensure that the <em>Library</em> can meet its legal, regulatory and good governance obligations (and regulator’s expectations), such as meeting audit requirements.</p>
<p>3.3          In addition, where agreed with <em>you</em>, <em>we</em> may tailor <em>our</em> communications and dealings with you to better reflect <em>your</em> needs and preferences, such as sending you newsletters with <em>your</em> preferred topics highlighted, or to inform <em>you</em> that <em>our</em> shop offers a book relevant to an event you are attending, or to make you aware that an event similar to one recently attended by you is being scheduled.</p>
<p>3.4          More details about why <em>we</em> use <em>your personal information</em> can be found on the Purposes page.</p>
<p>3.5          The Purposes page is not intended to be exhaustive and may be updated from time to time in line with the <em>Library</em>’s business needs and legal requirements.</p>
<p>3.6          <em>We</em> may also convert <em>personal information</em> into depersonalised (“pseudonymous”) data or anonymous data and use it (normally on an aggregated statistical basis) for research and analysis to improve <em>our</em> Services, processes and performance.
For more information, please see the <strong>Depersonalised and Anonymous Information</strong> section directly below.</p>
<p>3.7          In carrying out the above, the <em>Library</em> processes <em>your</em> personal data in a variety of ways, each of which may have a different legal basis.
<em>We</em> may process <em>your</em> personal data because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>You</em> have given your consent (e.g.
for the provision of marketing correspondence)</li>
<li>It is necessary for the performance of a contract with <em>you</em> (e.g.
the purchase of tickets or other goods or services)</li>
<li>
<em>We</em> are under a legal obligation to do so (e.g.
for equality monitoring or health &amp.
safety purposes)</li>
<li>It is in the public interest and in the performance of <em>our</em> official duties (e.g.
the provision of access to, and the security of, <em>our</em> Collections as set out in the British Library Act 1972)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<strong>4.            Depersonalised and Anonymous Information</strong>
<p>4.1          Depersonalised or aggregated information does not personally identify <em>you</em>.
It may be used for statistical analysis and administration, including analysis of trends, carrying out actuarial work, tailoring products and <em>Services</em>, risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to <em>our Services</em>.</p>
<p>4.2          <em>We</em> may automatically collect certain information from you (such as usage information) when <em>you</em> use <em>our data collection media,</em> through the use of web beacons, device identifiers, pixel tags, cookies and similar technologies.
<em>We</em> may combine this information with other <em>personal information</em> that <em>we</em> have collected from or about <em>you</em> in order to learn more about how <em>you</em> use <em>our data collection media</em> and <em>Services</em> so that <em>we</em> can improve <em>our Service</em> offering.</p>
<p>4.3          To find out more about how <em>we</em> collect and use this automatically collected information, please see <em>our</em> Cookies Policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>5.            Does the British Library share <em>personal information</em> with third parties?</strong>
<p>5.1          Your <em>personal information</em> will be made available to those members of <em>our</em> staff who need to see it in order to perform their functions/roles/responsibilities at the <em>Library</em> in respect of the <em>Services you</em> have requested or agreed to use.</p>
<p>5.2          <em>Your personal information</em> may be held by <em>us</em> in one or more customer relationship management or CRM database(s), consolidating details of <em>your</em> dealings with the <em>Library</em> across various Services, to ensure <em>we</em> have clear and accurate records about <em>your</em> use of <em>our</em> Services, to better understand <em>your</em> requirements and how <em>we</em> might provide other <em>Services</em> to <em>you</em>.   For instance, the <em>Library</em> may assess <em>your</em> attendance at events, against <em>your</em> purchases from <em>our</em> shop, in order to consider making you aware that event specific products may be purchased from our shop.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> Details relating to the specific Collection Items that you have requested during <em>your</em> use of <em>our</em> Collections (for example through use of <em>our</em> Reading Rooms or <em>our</em> remote <em>Services</em> such as Document Supply) will never be used to provide marketing analysis or similar functions.</p>
<p>5.3          In addition, the <em>Library</em> makes use of expert third party service providers to help it to provide relevant <em>Services,</em> such as expert IT providers helping the Library with <em>our</em> IT systems, or professional auditors<em>.</em> These third party service providers may use <em>your personal information</em> in order to provide the agreed <em>Service</em> to the <em>Library,</em> or to <em>you</em> on <em>our</em> behalf.
Please note that certain individuals who will see <em>your personal information</em> may not be based at the <em>Library</em> or in <em>your</em> country (please see <strong>below</strong>).</p>
<p>5.4          <em>We</em> may share <em>personal information</em> within the Library’s advisory boards, panels and councils as needed for reasonable management, analysis, planning and decision making, including in relation to taking decisions regarding <em>our Service</em> offering, order or customer request fulfillment.</p>
<p>5.5          Where thought necessary by the Library, in limited cases, your <em>personal information</em> may also be shared with other people and organisations outside the <em>Library</em> to the extent permitted or required by law (for example, to meet legal obligations on the Library, or to provide reasonable voluntary cooperation with a relevant police investigation), as further described on the Sharing Your Personal Information page.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>6.
           Will the British Library send your personal information overseas?</strong>
<p>6.1             You should be aware that the recipients of <em>your personal information</em> (as set out in this <em>policy</em>) may be located in countries or territories outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) which may not have data protection laws equivalent to those in the UK.</p>
<p>6.2             Where <em>we</em> (or our third party service providers acting on <em>our</em> behalf) transfer <em>your</em>
<em>personal information</em> to countries outside of the EEA, <em>we</em> will put in place such other measures as are required by law to ensure that those transfers are adequately protected.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>7.               What are your choices relating to contact from us?</strong>
<p>7.1          We may contact you with information that may affect your use of a service, for example, disruptions to services, reading room closures, lost property, or problems with orders, or to request your feedback in relation to those services.

Please note that you will not be able to unsubscribe from administrative and service-related communications unless you unsubscribe from the relevant services.</p>
<p>7.2<em>          We</em> may wish to provide <em>you</em> with information about new Services, including products, events, courses, collections, promotions and offers from the <em>Library</em> which may be of interest to <em>you</em>, and <em>we</em> may invite <em>you</em> to take part in market research.
<em>We</em> may contact <em>you</em> by email (or in some cases by mail) to tell <em>you</em> this information, but <em>we</em> will obtain <em>your</em> consent before contacting <em>you</em> with “direct marketing<em>”</em> in this way.</p>
<p>7.3          <em>We</em> will ensure that any direct marketing communications that <em>you</em> receive from the <em>Library</em> provide a simple way for <em>you</em> to decline or change your mind about further marketing.
For example, in emails the <em>Library</em> may provide <em>you</em> with an ‘unsubscribe’ link, or an email address to which <em>you</em> can send an opt-out request.
The <em>Library</em> will take steps to stop any direct marketing to which <em>you</em> object, or in respect of which <em>you</em> withdraw <em>your</em> consent, within a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for the change to be administered after being told of <em>your</em> objection or withdrawal of consent.</p>
<p>7.4             If <em>you</em> tell <em>us</em> that <em>you</em> no longer wish to receive the <em>Library’s</em> direct marketing communications <em>we</em> will take steps to respect <em>your</em> modified direct marketing preferences and will keep a record of <em>your</em> request so as to avoid contacting <em>you</em> again in the future with direct marketing content.</p>
