  SmugMug Privacy Policy (Last Updated: October 28, 2010)
<p>At SmugMug, Inc.
("SmugMug", "we", or "us"), we are passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of SmugMug's website at www.smugmug.com (the "Site"), and how that information is used and disclosed by SmugMug.</p>
<p>For information about how to make your photo galleries private and/or secure, please see:</p>
<p>http://www.smugmug.com/help/private-albums.</p> What is Personal Information?
<p>Personal information specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number—and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to him or her, such as information about his or her purchases.</p>
<p>Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies an individual.</p>
<p>Personal information does not include "aggregate" information.
Aggregate information is data collected about a group or category of products, services or customers from which individual customer identities have been removed.
Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better design new products and services, and refine existing products and services to serve our customers better.</p> Personal Information We Collect <p>Some third parties may place cookies in advertisements and in other locations on the Site, and may place Web beacons on the Site in conjunction with such cookies.
Information collected by these third parties is subject to those third parties' policies governing use and disclosure of personal information.
In addition, a third-party service is used to anonymously track traffic data on the Site through the use of a cookie that is not linked to, and does not track, any personally identifiable information about users of our Site.

<p>Additionally, when you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected, such as your computer's operating system and browser type, version, and capabilities (such as whether JavaScript is enabled and cookies are accepted), your Internet Protocol (IP) address and the time and date of your visit, the referring site (if applicable), as well as screen resolution, color and depth.
This information is tracked through the use of "cookies" and "Web beacons."</p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your browser at the request of a web site to store your personal preferences.
We use cookies to keep you logged in to the Site, to count the number of unique computers visiting the Site, and to record your user preferences.</p>
<p>Web beacons, also known as Web bugs, are small, graphic images on a Web page or other Web-based content that allow the site owner or a third party to monitor the IP address and other information of the site or computer viewing the Web page or content.
Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page or other Web content.
Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer to which the Web beacon is sent, the URL of the page from which the Web beacon comes, and the time it was viewed.
Web beacons can be linked to personal information.</p>
<p>We may place Web beacons on the Site in conjunction with cookies to monitor how visitors are navigating and/or interacting with the Site.
