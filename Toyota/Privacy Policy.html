The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address ("Personal Information")).
For example, Toyota may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, request information, submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs") or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.

Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on.
This information helps us keep our Web site fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor's interests.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.
Toyota also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Sites.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a Web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.

Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.
Toyota, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tailor our communications with you, facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Sites.
Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites and pages visited.
Cookies and other tracking technologies allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Sites; and determine the correlation between Toyota purchasers and the sites they visit.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies.
However, please be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s).
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
Pixel tags.
A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a Web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a Web page or in an e-mail, which indicates that a page or e-mail has been viewed.
In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
In order to ensure the safekeeping of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly collect Personal Information on our Sites.

ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT Toyota licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own Sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet.
In addition, Toyota may use third-party ad networks, publishers and other entities to serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content.
We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but ad network providers, data providers, publishers and other media-related companies, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.

To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page.
Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
7.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13.
Toyota does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children that young.
If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit your e-mail address or any other Personal Information to us through the Sites.
8.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information.

Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk.
Beware of Phishing Scams: There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion.
Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius.
In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address.
Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at this Web site.
This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information.
This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity.
For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.
cn), German (.
de) or British (.
co.
uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users.
Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security Numbers, or other personal information through e-mail or U.
S.
mail or fax or text message.
If you receive an e-mail or letter by U.
S.
mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam.
Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their inbox and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Antiphishing Workgroup are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.
9.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES The Sites include links to other Web sites, such as the Web site for Toyota Financial Services and to Web sites for Toyota dealers.
These Web sites are not under our control, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us.
Such other Web sites do not necessarily follow our Privacy Policy, and may place their own cookies on your Device.
This practice is standard on the Web, and we do not control cookies or Web beacons that may be placed on your Device by third parties whose advertising or links appear on our Sites.
These Web sites may have their own privacy and information security policy and terms and conditions.
Visitors should consult the other Web sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

By using the Sites, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
