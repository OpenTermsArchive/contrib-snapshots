For example, we will collect your credit card number and other payment-related information in connection with your purchase of products and/or services through the Platforms, and we will collect Personal Information when you submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs").
In addition, we may post customer testimonials/video testimonials on our Platforms which may contain personally identifiable information.
We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>

We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information).

If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s).
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
If you block or delete cookies, not all tracking that we have described in this privacy statement will stop.

<i>Websites.</i> For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Toyota, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.</p>
<br>
<p>
<i>Third Party Applications.</i> You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which, through your participation, you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information and Personal Information such as lists of your friends, “likes”, comments you have shared, groups and location.
Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network.
In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>

ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING.
HOW TO OPT-OUT.</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use third party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content.
We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you give us permission).
Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your precise location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited.
In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information.
The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information.
To do so, please visit the DAA Opt-Out Page.
Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>

<p>
<strong>7.
CHILDREN.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Platforms are not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian’s consent.
If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.</p>

<strong>8.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND PHISHING SCAMS.</strong>
</p>
<p>We take information security seriously and use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information.
However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk.
When we collect sensitive information on our sites or within our mobile application (such as credit card number or geo-location information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>Beware of Phishing Scams:</em> There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion.
Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius.
In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address.
Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at this web site.</p>
<p>This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one’s personal information.
This information can then be utilized to steal a person’s identity.
For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users.
Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other personal information through e-mail or U.S.
mail or fax or text message.
If you receive an email or letter by U.S.
mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam.
Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Antiphishing Workgroup are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.</p>

DISPUTES/ARBITRATION.</strong>
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.
IT INCLUDES <u>AN AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION</u>, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SITES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEED IN COURT.
THIS PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A <u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.
THIS AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A <u>JURY WAIVER</u>.</p>
<p>It is Toyota's goal that the Sites meet your expectations and that you are satisfied.
However, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention.
In those instances, Toyota is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you.
however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue.
Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with Toyota, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give Toyota an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.
This includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute to Toyota Motor North America, c/o Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., Toyota Customer Experience Center, P.O.
Box 259001 – Web Services, Plano, TX 75025-9001.
You then agree to negotiate with Toyota in good faith about your problem or dispute.
This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after Toyota's receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.</p>
<p>You agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your use of any of the Sites and these Terms shall be final and binding arbitration, except to the extent that you have in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate any of the Toyota Entities' or any third party patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, in which case you acknowledge that there is no adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought by the Toyota Entities and/or the applicable third party(ies) either in court or from an arbitrator.
You and we acknowledge that the Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under the Agreement (despite any other choice of law provision).
To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law do not supply substantive law necessary for the resolution of any disputes or claims, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply.
To the extent that the parties litigate any part of any dispute or claim in court, including, without limitation, obtaining provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, confirmation of the award, and judgment enforcement, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply.</p>
<p>Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
The arbitration shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
If the arbitration results in an award, then judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
<b>You and we agree to pay our own fees, costs, and expenses, including those for any attorneys, experts, and witnesses.</b> You agree that any claim for or award of attorneys' fees, including such claim or award pursuant of Chapter 38 of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is waived.
An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief.
As a limited exception to the agreement to arbitrate, you and we agree that you may take claims to small claims court, if your claims qualify for hearing by such court.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER VISITOR OF THE SITES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.
In the event that this <b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b> is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>
<p>WE BOTH AGREE THAT, WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND TOYOTA BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL INVOLVING ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN US.In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to this Agreement be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.
The immediately foregoing limitation does not apply to New Jersey residents.</p>
