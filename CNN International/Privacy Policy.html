We, our affiliates, or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDKs, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers and across websites, services, and apps over time, in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our Digital Services and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as ‘interest-based advertising’. We, our affiliates, or third parties may also use this information to associate your different browsers and devices together for interest-based advertising and for other purposes like research, analytics, internal operations, fraud prevention, and enhancing consumer experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to managing your preferences through our consent management platform, for more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs by visiting the <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Online Choices website</a> if in the EEA, which is hosted by and can be visited at the <a href="https://www.edaa.eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</a> (EDAA) website; if in Argentina to the <a href="http://tupublicidaddigital.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alianza de Publicidad Digital de Argentina</a> (APDA); if in Canada, by visiting the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</a> (DAAC) website and if in the United States, by navigating to the <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance of the US</a> (DAA) website. To learn more about interest-based advertising on mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please visit the <a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ad choice link</a> to download the version of AppChoices for your device. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select but will still allow the collection of Information for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You can therefore continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.</p><p><br></p><p>Important things to note about cookie-based web browser opt outs (such as those utilized by the EDAA, APDA and DAAC):</p><ul><li><strong>Blocked cookies:</strong> The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.</li><li><strong>Deleting or protecting opt outs:</strong> If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.</li><li><strong>Only this browser:&nbsp;</strong>The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it. For example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process. This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>The opt out does not block or delete cookies:</strong> It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Precise location information.</strong> To enable or disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection. You may also limit the collection of precise location information from websites through browser settings.</p></div></section><section class="otnotice-section" id="otnotice-section-66305e2a-6cb7-473b-812f-c20fee57fcf1"><h2 class="otnotice-section-header">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h2><div class="otnotice-section-content"><p>We operate internationally, and some of the processes involved in our use of your Information will require your Information to be stored or processed in countries outside the country where you are located, including countries where the level of legal protection for your Information may be different and where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to it.
