<strong> Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights</strong>
<br> We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research, third party advertising, promotions management and payment processing (to view PayPal's privacy policy, please visit https://www.paypal.com/privacy).
We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected.
These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than L.L.Bean.</p>
<p>From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to reputable companies whose products or services we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards.
We do not share email addresses for this purpose.
If you do not want to receive mailings from other reputable companies and prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please contact us.</p>
<p>If you apply for the L.L.Bean Visa Card, you provide the financial and personal information needed to process your application directly to Barclays Bank Delaware, the issuer and the administrator of the credit card program.
Barclays Bank Delaware is independent of L.L.Bean and has its own privacy and security policies.
You can review their policies at <u>www.barclaycardus.com</u>.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so.
We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation.
We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>  return to top </p>
<p>
<strong> Your Choices about Communication from L.L.Bean</strong>
<br> We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us.
If you prefer not to receive catalogs or email updates from L.L.Bean or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please visit the My Account section of llbean.com or contact us at the address shown below.
You can also unsubscribe from our email updates using the link provided in each edition of the email.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive other communications from us, such as surveys, please contact us at:</p>

CFM<br> Freeport, ME 04033<br> 800-559-0747, ext.
58138<br>preferences@llbean.com </p>
<p>So that we can be sure to identify you correctly, please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog.
Because mailings are planned in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective.
If due to human error you continue to receive unwanted communications, please contact us again, and we will make every effort to correct the situation.</p>

<strong>Third Party Catalog Opt-Out Services</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the past several years, many third party services have become available to help consumers opt-out of catalog mailings.
We currently do not honor requests made through these services, with the exception of Catalog Choice.
We made this decision after careful consideration of customer service, data protection, privacy and whether or not fees were associated with the service.
It is important to us that consumers not have to pay to make a catalog opt-out request.
Catalog Choice met all of our requirements.
If you prefer to use their service, we welcome you to visit their Web Site at catalogchoice.org.
Whether you use Catalog Choice or contact us directly with your mailing preferences, we are committed to meeting your needs.</p>

<p>We may also send promotional emails about products, special offers, services or events we believe may be of interest to you.
It is our intent to send promotional emails only to those who wish to receive them.
We provide instructions on how to unsubscribe in each email and within the My Account section of llbean.com.</p>
