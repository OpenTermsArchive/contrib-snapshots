Third Party Catalog Opt-Out Services Over the past several years, many third party services have become available to help consumers opt-out of catalog mailings.
We currently do not honor requests made through these services, with the exception of Catalog Choice.
We made this decision after careful consideration of customer service, data protection, privacy and whether or not there were fees associated with the service.
It is important to us that consumers not have to pay to make a catalog opt-out request.
Catalog Choice met all of our requirements.
If you prefer to use their service, we welcome you to visit their website at catalogchoice.

Whether you use Catalog Choice or contact us directly with your mailing preferences, we are committed to meeting your needs.
