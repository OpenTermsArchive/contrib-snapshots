</p> How We Use Your Personal Information.
<p>We use your personal information to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications and to get in touch with you when necessary.
For example, we may use your personal information to communicate with you or to send you information that you have requested.
Additionally, by registering for the Defy Site you will be automatically entered into sweepstakes and contests held on the Defy Site.
We may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey.
We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy.
Thus, we may also share personal information with Defy Affiliates.
Defy Affiliates may use and further share personal information in the same ways we do.
However, if we pass on personal information to a Defy Affiliate, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences.
For example, a Defy Affiliate may send to you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products or services that it thinks might be of interest to you, or contact you offline.
If you want to opt-out from our (or a family company) using the personal information you provided in these ways, please contact us.
Please see “How to Contact Us” later in this policy.</p> How We Share Your Personal Information.
<p>We will not share your personal information with third parties except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it.
(b) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g.
in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another).
and (c) with other persons, service providers, or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal Defy Site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Defy Site).
Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested.
Additionally, with your consent, we may share your personal information with companies not affiliated with us (i.e.
third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline.
Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers.
If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online.
In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.
If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy.
We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.</p> Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.
<p>We may use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Defy Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, including the ads that you see.
We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Defy Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services.

This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Defy Site, through the Defy Site.
We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies.

<p>As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit.
This anonymous information, which is sometimes referred to as "Clickstream Data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server.
Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Defy Site.
We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Defy Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Defy Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregated.</p> Supplementing Information.
<p>From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address.
Thus, information we obtain through the Defy Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Defy Site, including both offline and online sources.</p> Discussions and Community Tools.
<p>We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you.
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use.
For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Defy Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information.</p> Our Commitment to Security.
<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.
We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet including, without limitation, emails.
Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we have no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal information, including such information that has been provided to third parties or other users, or with regard to the failure of a third party to abide by the agreement between us and such third party.</p> Notice to California-Based Users.
