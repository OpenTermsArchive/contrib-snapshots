</p> III.
Our Websites and other websites (a) About Our Websites <p> Our Websites use a single-login system that let You connect among the Websites, including games and social interaction.
In this way, We can provide You with a personalized experience on the Websites.
</p>
<p> You are reminded that the links contained or included in Our Websites and Services may direct You to third party websites and they are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of the Company, so it is important that You read their terms of service and privacy policies as this is Your responsibility.
</p> (b) Logging in to another website using Y8 Account <p> In some circumstances, You may be able to log into third party websites using Y8 Account identity.
This means that You have the possibility to use the default Y8 Account identities or create new ones to log in to third party websites.
You can determine under which identity You want to access third party websites.
When You log in using Y8 Account, Your account information will never be transferred to the third party website without Your consent (Section II (c)).
In order for third party websites to uniquely identify Your account among other accounts, We send a unique identifier named ‘PID’ (personal identification).
Your PID is different for each third party website so as to preserver your anonymity.
</p>
<p> Be aware that there is a probability that third party websites, games or services may require from You different information than the one in the fields you have chosen to fill for Your Y8 Account identity.
For instance, You have filled in Your name and country but the third party website requires You to provide Your nickname as well.
The extra information required may vary from one third party website, game or service to another.
Once you do so, the extra information provided will be automatically added to the identity you have accessed that website with.
As a result, all the websites linked to that identity will also benefit from that additional information.
Nonetheless, You are able to view which third party website has access to which information You provided by going on the “Sites” section of Your Y8 Account.
</p>
<p> If You already have an account on a third party website, that website may also allow You to connect and link it to Your Y8 Account.
Your information will be sent to Us when You use Your Y8 Account to register or login to a third party website.
</p> (c) Privacy Practices of Third Parties <p> This privacy statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Us through Your interaction with Our Websites and Services.
Other websites that may be accessible from Our Websites may have their own privacy statements and Personal Information collection, use and disclosure practices.
For instance, and purely as an example, some websites require an over eighteen (18) years of age access.
</p>
<p> We are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of Third party websites.
Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information gathered through other websites.

changes You have made to any information, will automatically apply to all the linked websites to that Y8 Account and identity.

under the age of 18, his/her parent or legal guardian can request access, change or delete of the Personal Information We have, or refuse to allow any further reception or use of the information by a written letter to Us at privacy@y8.com.

<p> In order to protect the Users’ privacy and security, reasonable steps will be taken to verify the parent’s or legal guardian’s identity before granting access to the Personal Information.
