We may also use cookies in emails that you receive from us.
A "cookie" is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a web site.
A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).
A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same web site at a later date the cookie information is still available.
Generally, we use cookies to improve the quality of our service when you visit our web site and other web sites of interest to you.
We also use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our web sites and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns.</p>
<p>Certain of our Service Providers may use cookies and collect information on our behalf.
They are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Service Providers.
However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services.
You may opt out of certain of these services by clicking here.
In addition, in connection with the services that they provide to us, certain of our Service Providers may work with third parties who may use cookies to collect anonymous information to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Internet.
These third parties do not have access to any contact information about you.
If you would like to opt out of accepting cookies altogether, you can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
However, certain features of our web sites or other services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p> Security <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.
To guard your information delivered to us electronically, our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.
Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.
Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.</p> Protecting Children <p>Williams–Sonoma, Inc.
