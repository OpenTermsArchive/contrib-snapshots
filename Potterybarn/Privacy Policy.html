On the checkout page, you will be required to submit credit card and contact information (name, billing address, shipping address, email address and phone number) to FiftyOne to complete your order.
Upon completion of your order, FiftyOne will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to FiftyOne.
Simultaneously, FiftyOne will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you.
In this process, FiftyOne makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with FiftyOne's terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered.
Once you place your order, you will be prompted to check the box to indicate if you would like to receive information from Williams–Sonoma, Inc.

Cookies When you visit our web sites, we send one or more "cookies" to your computer or other device.
We may also use cookies in emails that you receive from us.
A "cookie" is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a web site.
A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.
e.
, close your browser).
A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same web site at a later date the cookie information is still available.
Generally, we use cookies to improve the quality of our service when you visit our web site and other web sites of interest to you.
We also use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our web sites and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns.
Certain of our Service Providers may use cookies and collect information on our behalf.
They are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Service Providers.
However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services.
You may opt out of certain of these services by clicking here.

Security We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.
To guard your information delivered to us electronically, our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.
