If you do not want to assist Symantec in improving its Web sites, you can “opt-out” of this web sites analysis by disabling JavaScript on your computer.
If you disable JavaScript, some of the features on our web sites will not work.
</p>
<br>
<p>Symantec may also use web beacons in promotional email messages to determine whether the message was opened and acted on.
We may use this information on email response to develop future promotions you may enjoy.
For these purposes, some of our Web beacons are tied to your e-mail address.
</p>
<br>
<p>Except for the email address you have previously provided, the information we collect does not identify you.
To modify your Norton privacy options, visit here.
</p>
<br>
<p>Symantec may also use third party scripts on our sites to optimize the effectiveness of Symantec's ads appearing on other parties' sites.
The information collected is not personally identifiable and is limited to the minimum information necessary to optimize effectiveness.
Symantec has no access or control of any third party tracking technologies.</p> 3.4 Flash LSOs <p>Third parties with whom we partner use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences for audio control.  </p>
<br>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:  <br>http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/<br>settings_manager.html#117118</p> 4.0 Managing Your Privacy 4.1 Opt-in and Opt-out <p>In jurisdictions where your consent is required at the point of collection before any sharing of your information can take place, you will be given the option to opt-in before such information is being shared, and to opt-in to the transfer of your contact information to a third party.</p>
<br>
<p>In other jurisdictions, we may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information, or subsequently through ‘opt-out’ mechanisms.</p> 4.2 Communication Choices <p>If you are on a Symantec web page that requires personal information to be submitted but does not offer communication choices, or if you would like to change your preferences for information that you have previously provided, please use one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement.</p> 4.3 Other Privacy Considerations Please remember that information you submit in a discussion groups or forums, like "Ask Symantec", will be deemed public information and will not be kept as confidential.
There is a risk in such communication venues that information can be collected and used by others.
Please be careful and responsible when you are participating in such discussion groups or forums.
For further details, please see our Social Media Privacy Policy.
4.4 Updating or Correcting Your Personal Information <p>You have the right to update or correct or remove your personal information.
If you believe that Symantec does not have your most current personal information, you can update it at your Norton Account, at your Symaccount or through the other communication channels at the bottom of this notice.
If requested, and to the extent permissible by applicable law relating to the retention of records or otherwise not required for valid business purposes (such as fulfillment of transactions), you may request that we use our best efforts to remove such data from Symantec repositories.</p>
<br>
<p>Symantec will respond to access requests within 30 days.</p> 5.0 Transferring and Sharing Information 5.1 Transferring Information <p>Since Symantec is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices, with information processing taking place in many countries.
The personal information that you have provided to us, for the purposes set out above, will be transferred to servers in the United States, and there may be further transfers to other countries in which Symantec has operations, or to our outside contractors for the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information for the purposes outlined above.
In respect to transfers from the European Economic Area to the United States or elsewhere, Symantec has data transfer agreements in place if and as required by the data privacy authorities in European countries from where such transfers of personal information are being made.</p> 5.2 Sharing Information <p>From time to time, and in jurisdictions where it is permitted, we may provide your information to Symantec Partners to communicate to you information or offers about products or services that they believe are important to you or your business.
If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods described in this Statement, Symantec provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners by ‘opt-out’ options provided at the point of collection, through e-mail notices, or through other preference management that may be available depending on the service or web-site.
</p>
<br>
<p>If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the "unsubscribe" address in the body of the email.
</p> 5.3 Third Parties <p>In addition, Symantec may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us (e.g.
ship products, provide technical support, or handle order processing).
</p>
<br>
<p>For example, you may decide to purchase a license to a number of Symantec software products online in a downloadable format by way of Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) or in a CD format from one of Symantec’s authorized online resellers.
If you elect to purchase a software license through one of Symantec’s authorized online resellers, your personal data will need to be shared between the Symantec reseller (as your vendor) and Symantec (as the software manufacturer and licensor).
Furthermore, in order to manage purchases and license renewals by Symantec customers, Symantec will need to share your personal information with a billing system service provider.
Such service provider will process data of Symantec’s customers only on behalf of Symantec.
(These examples are not exhaustive, and may change from time to time).</p>
<br>
<p>We require that all such contractors keep the personal information of our customers secure and confidential.
We have contractually bound third parties to such restrictions and require that these contractors provide for appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure the data, that they use personal information only on behalf of Symantec and that they do not share personal information with others or use your personal information for their own marketing purposes.
</p> 5.4 Legal Disclosures Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Symantec to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by applicable law.
No personal information will be disclosed to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response to:<br>
<ul>
<li>A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;</li>
<li>A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that Symantec would be in breach of local law were it to refuse to provide such information, and it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process, provided there is a legal basis to do so, or,</li>
<li>Where such disclosure is necessary for Symantec to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered, and there is a legal basis to do so.</li>
</ul> 6.0 Security of Personal Information <p>We have taken appropriate security measures, consistent with international information practices, to protect your personal information.
These measures include, on our web sites and Internet-enabled technologies, administrative, technical, physical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.
These measures include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Physical safeguards</em>, such as locked doors and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities, and secure destruction of media containing personal information;</p>
<br>
<p>
<em>Technology safeguards</em>, such as use of Symantec anti-virus and endpoint protection software, encryption, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure compliance with our security policies, and in particular, credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption;</p>
<br>
<p>
<em>Organizational safeguards</em>, through training and awareness programs on security and privacy, to ensure employees understand the importance and means by which they must protect personal information, as well as through privacy policies and standards that govern how Symantec treats personal information.</p>
</blockquote> 7.0 Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It 7.1 Non-Personal Information We Collect <p>We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when users visit our web sites.
Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor.
It tells us information such as how many users visited our sites and the pages accessed.
By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our web sites to our visitors.</p>
<br>
<p>We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with “web beacons,” as explained above.</p> 7.4 Web Site Traffic Through our various tracking methods discussed above and using log files, we may track domain names, IP addresses, and browser types from people who visit our site.
We use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout Symantec’s Web site.
Such information is not correlated with any personal information.
8.0 IP Addresses Symantec collects and retains, for a limited period of time, internet protocol (IP) address information, of its customers, for the following purposes:<ul>
<li>subscription and registration,</li>
<li>to provide technical support;</li>
<li>to obtain geolocation information;</li>
<li>and to secure our networks and systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>IP addresses collected by Symantec are primarily traffic data, which is not necessarily personal information.
Symantec does not have the means to reasonably and authoritatively link an IP address to an identifiable individual.
Registration of a product does create a unique computer identifier, which is linked to an IP address at the time of registration.
however, IP addresses are usually assigned dynamically and therefore are temporary, and may be behind network address translation, and are often capable of falsification (spoofing).</p>
<br>
<p>For LiveUpdate’s privacy Policy, please see http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/policies/luprivacy.jsp.</p> 9.0 Links to Business Partner and Co-branded Sites <p>At the Symantec Web sites, there are a number of links to companies with whom we have a relationship.
Symantec is not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners.
We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours.</p>
<br>
<p>We also link to co-branded Web sites that are maintained by Symantec and one or more of our business partners who are collecting your information pursuant to their own policies and purposes.
</p>
<br>
<p>We encourage you to read the privacy policies on any co-branded site to which you link for information on the privacy practices of that site.<strong>
</strong>
</p> 10.0 Statement Changes In the event there is a major change to Symantec's privacy practices, a prominent notice will be posted on our Web site.
If the change involves the use of your personally identifiable information, the notice will contain instructions on how you can opt-out of such use.
