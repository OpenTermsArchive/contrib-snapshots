</ul>Privacy
<p>Privacy is fundamental to Yammer.
Each company or organization on Yammer lives in a separate Network that assures the privacy of its Members and the User Content posted in that Network.
Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Network is defined by your company or organization’s email domain.
For example, all users who sign up with a “megacorp.com” email address would be part of the megacorp.com network.
To join a Network, you must confirm your email address.</li>
<li>Only the people in your Network can view the Member profiles and feeds.</li>
<li>Users can require anyone else in their Network to re-confirm their email address at any time to prove they still belong in that Network.
You can use this feature to remove former colleagues.
Network administrators can also remove a user at any time.</li>
<li>We don’t share your private information with advertisers.
This includes your email address and the email addresses of others in your Network.</li>
<li>Companies can impose additional security requirements for their networks, such as secure sessions, password policies, and restricting access to the IP range of their VPN.</li>
<li>Companies who claim their network own the User Content created by their employees.
Until that point, Users own their own User Content.
Yammer does not own User Content.
Network Administrators can request that messages posted to their Network be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes.</li>
<li>Yammer’s administrative tools do not allow our employees to view messages in a Network.
Access to our database is granted only to our technicians on a case-by-case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues, or as may be required by law.
Each such instance is logged.</li>
<li>Yammer has instituted measures to protect the security of each Network’s data.</li>

<p>Welcome to www.yammer.com (“Website”).
We are happy that you have chosen to visit our Website and learn more about our company.
Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website.
We will not use or share your Personal Information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy the term “www.yammer.com” refers to our Website, the homepage of which is located at www.yammer.com.
the terms “us” or “we” or “our” refers to Yammer, Inc.
(“Yammer”), the owner of www.yammer.com, and the terms “you” or “user” refer to the user or viewer of www.yammer.com.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>When using Yammer, there are general elements of our service that you should know.
First, your network of contacts is defined by your company or organization’s email domain.
To join a network, you must confirm your email address and it must match the email domain of your company.
Additionally, only people in your network can view other member profiles and feeds.
Companies that “claim” their network can impose additional security requirements beyond those described in this Privacy Policy.
Examples of such restrictions include secure sessions, password policies and restricting access to the internal protocol range of their virtual private network.
Additionally, companies that claim their network own the user generated content of their employees.
Yammer does not own such user generated content and network administrators can request that user generated content posted to their network be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes.
Yammer’s administrative tools do not allow our employees to view messages in a network.
Access to our database is granted only to our technicians on a case-by-case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues, or as may be required by law.
For further details on using Yammer, please refer to our Terms of Use Agreement, located here.</p>

</ol>Website Usage Information
<ol>
<li>
Cookies
<p>We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Website to maintain information about you.
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.
Yammer employs the use of both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.</p>
<p>When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie.
Our Website will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.</p>
<p>Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.
However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
Clear GIFs
<p>We may also use “Clear GIFs” (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in our Website and/or in our communications with you.
A Clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which helps us to verify an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your Personal Information.
We use information provided from Clear GIFs to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Yammer better for our users.</p>

Security
<p>Yammer uses commercially reasonable and industry standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information.
We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit sensitive information.
While Yammer endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.</p>
