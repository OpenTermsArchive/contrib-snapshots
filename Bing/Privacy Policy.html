<u>Our Use of Cookies</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server.
Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well.
Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 </p>
<p>We may use cookies for: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Storing your Preferences and Settings.</b> If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site.
This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.
</li>
<li>
<b>Sign-in and Authentication.</b> When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk.
This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page.
When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer.
We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience.
For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out.
This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.
If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Targeted Advertising.
</b>When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you.
Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages you visit on Microsoft and other sites, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed.
This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again.
We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.
You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.</li>
<li>
<b>Site Analytics.
</b>We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services.
These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart.
This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies.
If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:</p>
<b>Cookie name</b>
<b>Description</b> MUID
Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites.
It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.
.
ANON
Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like.
It is also used to preserve a user’s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.
CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.
Microsoft account authentication
Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.
NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user’s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user’s Windows Live profile.
MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.
ACH01
Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.
TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.
<p>In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites.
In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics.
In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks.
Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.
</p>
<p>
<u>
<b>How to Control Cookies</b>
</u>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Browser Controls to Block Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.
<p>For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options” </li>
<li>Click the “Privacy” tab at the top of the window </li>
<li>Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block </li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Browser Controls to Delete Cookies</b>.
If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.
<p>For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options” </li>
<li>On the “General” tab, under “Browsing History,” click the “Delete” button </li>
<li>On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies” </li>
<li>Click the “Delete” button </li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection.</b> Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.
</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 has a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers.
When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked.
By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit.
For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and how to find them, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Advertising Opt-Out Controls.</b> Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use.
Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft).
These pages include:   <ul>
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
</li>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
</li>
<li>In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices.
For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/.
Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads.
however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted.
In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>Our Use of Web Beacons</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services.
We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p>We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.</p>
<p>Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations.
These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer.
We prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information.
Nevertheless, you may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers: </p>

<u>Other Similar Technologies</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer.
This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.
But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior.
These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or “Flash cookies”) and Silverlight Application Storage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies.”</b> Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies” to store data on your computer.

</ul> Collecting Your InformationCollecting Your Information <p>When you use Bing services, Microsoft may collect many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can.
We collect information when you register, sign in and use our sites and services.
We also may get information from other companies.
We collect this information in a variety of ways, including from web forms, technologies like cookies, web logging and software on your computer or other device.</p>
<p>When you conduct a search, Microsoft collects the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Search term and time and date of your search</li>
<li>IP Address, browser configuration and approximate location</li>
<li>Any unique identifiers contained in the cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>We store search terms (and the cookie IDs associated with search terms) separately from any account information that directly identifies the user, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers.

<p>Microsoft provides many of our sites and services free of charge because they are supported by advertising.
In order to make these services widely available, the information we collect may be used to help improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant to you.
For example, we may use search query data for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners.
The search terms you enter in Bing are categorized and certain user segments are inferred based on those terms.
For example, if you search on terms associated with sports, we may associate a “sports segment” with the unique identifier contained in your cookie, and you will then be more likely to see ads related to sports.</p> Reasons We Share Your Personal InformationSharing Your Information <p>Except as described in this privacy statement, we won’t disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent.</p>

When you sign in to Windows 8 on another PC or device with the same Microsoft account, the service will download and apply those settings to the additional PC or device.
These settings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your favorites, including stocks, sports and news, depending on the app.
</li>
<li>Your settings, including weather units.
and</li>
<li>Your history, including search history, if enabled.</li>

<p>If you do not want the service to store your customized settings on Microsoft servers or to download and apply them onto PCs and devices that you use, either do not sign into Windows with a Microsoft account or a domain account connected to a Microsoft account or turn off this functionality in the “sync your settings” options of Windows 8.
Certain applications may store your search history on your PC and devices, and you may clear your search history by going to the “Settings” of that application.</p>
<p>If you consent to send location information to an app, that information will be used to provide the service you’ve requested, as well as to improve our products and services.
You can stop sending location information by going to the “Privacy” options of Windows 8 or, to stop sending location information to a specific app, go to the “Settings” of that app, then “Permissions” and disable location.</p> Bing ApplicationsBing Applications <p>Bing applications, such as Bing Bar and Bing Desktop, use Bing search services to provide you with quick and convenient ways to access information such as searching the internet, weather forecasts, traffic reports, or other information depending on the features of the application (not all Bing applications or features are available in every country).

<p>Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners.</p>
<p>
<b>Creating a Microsoft account.</b>
</p>
<p>You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other “account proofs,” such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer.
We will use your “account proofs” for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account.
Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key.
The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your “credentials” that you will use to authenticate with our network.
Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.</p>
<p>When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender.
country.
birthdate.
and postal code.We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law.
In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information.
In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number).
If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads.
For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement.</p>
<p>You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account.
This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners.
Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services.
we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law.
For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications.</p>
<p>If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.
</p>
<p>
<b>Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.</b>
</p>
<p>When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service.
For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date.
Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device.
this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account.
The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next.
the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information).
whether your email address has been confirmed.
and whether your account has been deactivated.</p>
<p>Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services.
In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service.
However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.</p>
<p>If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password,view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account.
In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party.
If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.
</p>
<p>Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements.
However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested.
All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary.
<b>
<i>You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Accessing your personal information.</b>
</p>
<p>You can access your personal information by going to account.
You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain.
You can always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer.
You may also close your Microsoft account by going to account, and then “Close your account.” If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account.
Please note that if you are an MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.
