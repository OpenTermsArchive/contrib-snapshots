<strong>3.
Collection and Providence of Information and Content</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit Wix.com you provide us with two types of information: limited personal information and content you knowingly choose to disclose and/or post on the Wix.com website.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you register with Wix.com, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name and your email address.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you enter Wix.com, we collect your browser type and IP address.
This information is gathered for all Wix.com visitors.
In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID and password to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Wix.com.
You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Wix.com Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk.
Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your personal content, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and content.
Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed (or even harmed) by unauthorized persons.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.
You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
Billing information </strong>
</p>
<p>Should you sign up for a Charged Service (as defined in the Terms of Use), we will require your billing information in order to process the transaction and to collect the fees involved.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We do not store your billing information, and this information will be discarded after your transaction has been processed.
Nevertheless, the required information for your billing will be stored by our payment gateway company which will store your billing information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, and credit card type, so that you may identify the card used in the future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Should you cancel your subscription, your billing information will be removed by the payment gateway company.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 1024-bit encryption.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
Sharing Your Content with Third Parties</strong>
</p>
<p>Wix.com provides, as a main service, the ability of sharing created content with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with privacy settings that restrict other users from viewing and/or accessing your content without your consent.
We allow you to choose the content you wish to provide to friends and networks through Wix.com and the manner in which you choose to share it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may provide information and/or personal user content to service providers to help us provide the services we offer.
Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Wix.com, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services.
In connection with these business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information and/or content for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.
</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstrations of user created content that allow non-users a glimpse into the Wix.com world.
Such content is provided in a form which protects your content from any unauthorized editing and/or changing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.
We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards.
Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Wix.com service or using the Wix.com name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm.
This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We may offer or provide services jointly with other companies on Wix.com.
You can tell when another company is involved in the providence of such service on Wix.com, and we may share customer information with such third party in connection with your use of such service.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are logged out from Wix.com, or that pertains to non-Wix.com users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical operation of our system.
In cases where Wix.com receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-Wix.com users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Wix.com accounts and will discard it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In any case in which the ownership of Wix.com's business shall change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.
In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you use Wix.com, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select.
All such sharing of information is done at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
Links</strong>
</p>
<p>Wix.com may contain links to other websites.
We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites.
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Wix.com or posted on the Wix.com website.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
Third Party Advertising</strong>
</p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Wix.com are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers.
They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.
Wix.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.
Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Wix.com unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Wix.com and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
Changing or Removing Content</strong>
</p>
<p>Access and control over personal content on Wix.com is possible through the content editing tools.
Wix.com users may modify or delete any of their personal content at any time by logging into their account.
Any such changes will be updated immediately.
Users who wish to deactivate their Wix.com account may do so on the My Account page.
Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to users of Wix.com.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
Security </strong>
</p>
<p>Wix.com takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information and content.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards which protect your account information and uploaded content.
Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information or data to us by email or instant messaging services.
