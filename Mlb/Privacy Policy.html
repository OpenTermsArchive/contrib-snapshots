</p> 2.
How, and for What Purpose, We Use and Share Your Personal Information<p>If you submit personal information to us, or to any third party acting on our behalf (a "Service Provider"), via the MLB Properties, we may use and share your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, as disclosed when you first submit your information or as otherwise permissible under applicable law.
We will not sell, lease, publish or share your personal information with or to anyone else, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We may use and share your personal information as described in Section 1 above and: </p>

<li>With one or more MLB Clubs or other MLB Entities, to the extent you've submitted information or accessed functionality or content that relates specifically to such MLB Club(s) or other MLB Entities (e.g., you've asked to receive the email newsletter of an MLB Club or you've made an MLB Club-specific purchase), so we and they may learn more about fans like you, add you to the MLB Club's postal mail list, and provide better services to you;</li>
<li>To send you periodic surveys to help improve the MLB Properties or your Major League Baseball experience;</li>
<li>In connection with loyalty, membership or rewards programs operated or accessible from the MLB Properties.

<li>In accordance with any other permission you provide at the time you submit such information to us.
and</li>
<li>To provide your personal information to other MLB Entities where necessary for the purposes set out in this policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>For customers in the EEA, we are required to give you information about the legal basis on which we process your personal information.
In some cases, such as where you have purchased a service, the processing of your personal information will be necessary in order to perform a contract with you.
In many other cases, the processing will be necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests we are pursuing, namely the facilitation of the purposes for which your personal information is processed as set out above.</p> 3.
Other Information Collected<p>Technical Information.
When you use the MLB Properties, we use software tools, including but not limited to cookies (small amounts of data which include a unique string of characters sent to your browser or application from a website's computers and stored on your computer's or device's hard drive), web beacons (technology used to track activity, also known as pixel tags) and similar technologies, to collect a variety of information, for example the IP address of the computer or device used to access an MLB Property, the type of Internet browser or operating system used to access an MLB Property, the date and duration of a Website visit or the IP address used to access the Website.
We use such technical information for internal purposes, for example to study and improve the response times of our Website.
We may associate such technical information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information.
Please be advised that associating technical information with personal information may be required for us, and our Service Providers, to recognize you and your communications with us, for example to retain your newsletter preferences or enable your use of a "shopping cart."   Customers within the EEA will be asked for consent prior to the setting of cookies.</p>
<p>Location Data.
When you use an MLB Property via a wireless device we may solicit your permission to collect your location data.
Some features within our Applications (e.g., live Major League Baseball game video or location-based offers) may only function upon confirmation of your location, and therefore such features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us.
The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the Internet (e.g., via cable broadband connection, WiFi).
If you enable location services for our Applications, we may collect location data (e.g., zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Applications.
We use such location information for internal purposes and to improve your MLB Property experience, for example to understand where our users are most successfully accessing the MLB Properties.
We may associate such location information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information.
Depending on the platform you use to access our Applications (e.g., Apple's iOS, Google's Android) you may be able to control whether location data is collected from within "Settings" or other controls on your wireless device or the Applications.
</p>
<p>Our Access to Your Contacts.
When you use our Games, we may solicit your permission to access your contacts list (e.g., address book) so you can be matched with individuals from your contacts list who participate in our Games and you can invite your friends to play.
We will not store the information in your contacts list except to manage your Game invitations.
</p>
<p>Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons.
Network Advertisers.
We allow and use select third parties, such as those who deliver advertisements, content, or social networking or which provide other services associated with the MLB Properties, to collect data and/or serve ads when you visit MLB Properties.
We may also make available certain data you have given to us (e.g., IP address) or that we have collected through publicly available means to third parties engaged in targeting advertisements on the MLB Properties including for use in accordance with such third party's privacy policy. Network advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to MLB Properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
This may happen through permission given to such third parties to set cookies, web beacons or similar technologies in certain locations within the MLB Properties, including but not limited to certain of our emails.
Third party companies that manage and deliver advertisements to websites and applications such as ours are commonly referred to as "network advertisers." A permitted network advertiser may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the MLB Properties in order to tailor certain advertisements and content delivered within the MLB Properties and on other websites within such network advertiser's ad network.
These companies may also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on or off MLB Properties.
Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
You may learn more about network advertising industry practices and opt out of targeted behavioral advertising from many major third party network advertisers and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies via the information and tools available here and here.</p>
<p>To facilitate the activity described above, we use a third party to convert your email address into a unique code (hashed email address), which is then provided to the advertiser.
</p>
<p>Other Advertising.
We share certain data with Social Networks (as defined below) such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Snapchat to allow us to target existing users and customers with highly relevant advertising campaigns.
We will not share your name, address, email address or telephone number for the purposes of such campaigns.
Instead, a unique code (hashed email address) is shared with the applicable Social Network in order for that identifier to be matched against existing users of the relevant Social Network and to identify potentially relevant audiences for targeted advertising.
We use services such as LinkedIn Matched Audiences and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes.
If you do not wish to receive advertisements in this way, please follow the links in the paragraph above.
</p>
<p>In addition to advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to advertise their own goods and services including by targeting those advertisements to those that might be most interested in them.
These advertisements may be shown within our Games.
This is done using information which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number and we will not share or sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers.
In order to provide advertisements relevant to you, your IP address will be used, as well as your operating system and device type.
Information about your particular device will be used to show you advertisements which work properly on that device.</p>
<p>Social Networking.
When using the MLB Properties or when using certain third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google +) (each a "Social Network"), you may have the option to connect your MLB Property information and activity with your Social Network information and activity.
If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to share or publish information about your MLB Property activity with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you consent to the connection.
Information we may share with a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, technical information about your MLB Property activity, your MLB Property comments or the videos you watch on MLB Properties.
Information we may access about you, with your consent, from a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, your basic Social Network information, your location data, your list of contacts, friends or followers and certain information about your activities on the Social Network.
If you permit a connection between a Social Network and an MLB Property, we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and privacy control options of any Social Network with which you choose to share information or connect to an MLB Property.
</p>
<p>Device ID.
When you use certain MLB Properties, we or our Service Provider may collect your unique Device ID.
We may use such information for internal purposes and to provide you a better MLB Property experience, for example to troubleshoot Application problems you may experience or provide you rewards or offers in connection with your Game activity.
We may associate Device ID with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information.
You may learn more about our Service Provider for Mobile Games and opt out of any anonymous Device ID collection via the privacy settings available within your mobile device.</p> 4.
Other Circumstances When Your Data May Be Shared<ul>
<li>Aggregated and Anonymous Information.
We may share aggregated, anonymous information with any third party.
This information is not linked to personal information that can identify you or another individual person.

In such a case, our customer information may be one of the business assets we transfer.
</li>
<li>Disclosure for Legal Purposes.
We may be required to share your personal and non-personal information pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders.
If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law.

</ul> 5.
Transferring Your Personal Information Across Borders<p>For customers in the EEA we are obliged to provide certain information relating to the transfer of your personal information outside the EEA.
Where you have purchased a service, it may often be necessary to transfer your personal information in order to perform a contract with you.
In addition, we may in some circumstances rely on your express consent.
If you submit personal information to us, or to a Service Provider, via the MLB Properties, you will be voluntarily transferring this personal information to the United States, a jurisdiction which does not provide the same framework as the EEA for the protection of personal information.
The same will be the case in relation to your personal information which is collected when you use MLB Properties as specified above.</p> 6.
Managing Your Personal Information<p>You may choose and control what information you provide about yourself and certain information which is automatically collected via the MLB Properties.
If you do not wish to provide certain information necessary for enhanced functionality or content on the MLB Properties, please do not use such functionality or content.

<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows a user to accept or reject most cookies.
Certain cookies that are set when you access certain video products via the MLB Properties, called local shared objects or Flash cookies, may not be managed using the settings in your web browser.
Information on managing, accepting and rejecting these cookies is available from Adobe on the Adobe Website.
If you set your browser or Adobe Flash options not to accept cookies or local shared objects, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the MLB Properties.</p>
<p>If you want to review or revise the personal information you provided during Website registration or in connection with certain Website purchases, or change the promotional email communications or newsletters you receive from us, you may click here to log in, and then click on the applicable left-hand menu option(s).
If you want to review or revise other personal information you have provided to us, or to close your account(s) and have us delete the applicable account personal information (except what is needed for record-keeping purposes) call Customer Service at 866-800-1275.</p>
<p>Remember that when you share information publicly online, it may be indexable by search engines or recorded by others, and any search engine index or record of your information may persist after you delete the information at the original source.</p>
<p>For customers in the EEA, you have the right to see a copy of the personal information that we hold about you, and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that this information is accurate and kept up to date.</p>
<p>In addition, subject to limitations as provided for by applicable data protection legislation you have the right to request the erasure of your personal data or the restriction of its processing, or the transfer of your personal data to another data controller.
Please contact us as specified below if you wish to do so.</p>
<p>Your personal information will be held for the purposes and uses set out in this Privacy Policy and for as long as there is a legal, taxation, accounting, risk management or business requirement to do so.

This period may be extended where circumstances so require or until a particular query, investigation or dispute is fully resolved.</p> 7.

We do not install any Spyware or Adware in connection with the MLB Properties, or distribute any commercial message, or authorize any third party to distribute any commercial message, by means of Spyware or Adware.
"Spyware" or "Adware" is any software which has been downloaded to or installed on an Internet user's computer or device, without the user's actual consent, and facilitates the distribution of any commercial message to the user.

<li>Special Rules For Children.
Because of federal law, we are not permitted to knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child's parent or guardian.
The statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen.
Some elements of the MLB Properties (e.g., shop, ticketing, and auctions) require the submission of a payment card number along with personal information in connection with a purchase.
other elements of the MLB Properties (e.g., fantasy baseball) require the submission of personal information to access or use the MLB Properties.
Except in certain cases where limited contact information may be collected and not retained, these elements of the MLB Properties are not available to children under the age of thirteen.
If a child who we know to be under the age of thirteen and for whom we have not received parental consent attempts to utilize a service on the MLB Properties which is not available to children, he/she will not be able to access it and may receive a message which relays that he/she is not eligible for such feature.
For children located in jurisdictions within the EU or EEA, where this Privacy Policy refers to consent, this will require the consent of a parent or legal guardian in relation to any person under the age specified by the law applicable to the location of the child in question.</li>
