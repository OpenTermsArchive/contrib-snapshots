</p>
<p>ARLO’s liability for damages, especially for breach of duty or obligation, delay in performance, non-performance, or malperformance shall be precluded, except when these are due to negligent breaches of any significant contractual duty or obligation on the part of ARLO.
Any liability for negligence is limited to direct losses usually and typically foreseeable in such case.
Should the claim for damages be based on wilful or grossly negligent breach of contractual duty or obligation on the part of ARLO, the preclusion and limitation of liability mentioned in the preceding sentences WIll not apply.
The preceding preclusion and limitation of liability WIll also not apply to claims for damages arising out of loss of life, bodily injury or health impacts for which ARLO may be liable, or for non-contractual liability.</p>
<p>Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
Additionally, this provision is not intended to limit ARLO's liability in the event of ARLO's willful or intentional misconduct.
Moreover, if ARLO mistakenly or wrongfully overcharges your account, this section does not limit ARLO's ability to refund such mistakenly or wrongfully overcharged amounts.</p>

<p>Last Updated: November 25, 2019</p>
<p>
<strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AND IN FULL.
THEY CONTAIN CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF THE ARLO SERVICE YOU ARE ACTIVATING ("Arlo Service")..</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>These "Arlo Service Terms" supplement the Arlo Terms and Conditions ("Arlo Terms" or "Terms"), which will otherwise apply in full force and effect, subject to any additional terms set forth herein.
In the event of any inconsistency between the Arlo Service Terms and the Arlo Terms, the terms and provisions of the Arlo Service Terms will govern and control.</u>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Activation.</strong> To activate your Arlo Service, you must affirmatively take certain steps - this activation will not occur automatically.
For new Arlo users, this will involve creating an Arlo account as part of the sign up process.
Your use of the Arlo Service will be subject to these Arlo Service Terms, the Arlo Terms, and Arlo's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Duration.</strong> You may cancel your Arlo Service or delete your Arlo account at any time, upon which you will lose access to the Arlo Service and/or Arlo account.
To take any of these actions, log into your Arlo account and follow the prompts on the account page.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy.</strong> If your Arlo Service utilizes facial recognition, object recognition, and other artificial intelligence capabilities then Arlo may capture digital images, videos, sounds, and use information provided by your Arlo system.
Arlo automatically may compare these captured images and sounds to databases of stored records.
You explicitly agree that such data and other biometric or environmental data may be captured by your Arlo system and used and analyzed by the Arlo Service, but Arlo employees do not view your private images or private videos without your permission.
In addition to the above-described information you provide to the Arlo system for use by the Arlo Service, you also acknowledge and agree that you will provide other information to Arlo, such as your email address, physical address, and credit card information.
This latter information is for the purpose of activating and administering the Arlo Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Payment.</strong> The credit card you provide when signing up for the Arlo Service will automatically be charged the current price of the Arlo Service for each subscription period until you cancel.
<u>You can cancel the Arlo Service at any time prior to the commencement of the new subscription period, but you will not be provided a pro-rated refund for the current subscription period.</u>If Arlo changes the monthly or other term subscription fee for the Arlo Service in the future, we will provide you advanced notice of the price change and when it will take effect.
If not cancelled, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.
By not canceling and continuing to use the Arlo Service after the price change takes effect, you agree to be charged the new price.
In other words, after your subscription period ends then the price for the next subscription period could be different, but the price will not be change during your current subscription period.</p>

We disclaim all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centers and the national emergency calling center.
We rely on third parties to assist us in routing Arlo Smart E911 Service communications to local emergency response centers and to a national emergency calling center.
We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route communications is incorrect or yields an erroneous result.
Neither Arlo nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to our Arlo Service unless such claims or causes of action arose from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
