If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the previous calendar year (e.
g.

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Our Site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18.
MBUSA does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal Information from children under the age of 18.
In addition, no part of this Site is designed with the purpose of attracting any person under age 18.
To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 18 should not provide any Personal Information on this Site.
We ask that parents supervise their children while online.
Pixel Tags We may use Pixel Tags on our Site and may permit third parties to place them on our Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes.
A Pixel Tag, also known as a "Web bug", is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document, or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site.
Web beacons are often invisible to the visitor because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document, or email message.
Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; visitors can click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon.
Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, and the time it was viewed.
Web beacons can also be linked to Personal Information.
For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile.
Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular website.
Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.
IP Address and Click-Stream Data Collection MBUSA may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for market research, for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information.
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet.
Our servers identify your computer by its IP address.
When you request web pages from our Site, our servers log your IP address.
Click-stream data is information collected by our servers when you request pages from our Site.
Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view, and other such Non-Personal Information.
When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at our Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content, and the like.
Security MBUSA uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction by any unauthorized party.
We encrypt order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our customers' information is safe as it is sent over the Internet to our server.
We exercise reasonable care to protect your Personal Information.
This includes storing the Personal Information on our servers behind a secure firewall and ensuring all transmissions to other vendors use secure encryption technology.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.
So while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us.
This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email.
We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us.
Once we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information.

These persons are limited in number and are committed to our privacy and security policies.
We will review our security arrangements from time to time, as we deem appropriate.
