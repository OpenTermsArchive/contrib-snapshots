If you pay in advance on SamsClub.com at the time of order placement, subject to the note immediately below for fresh weighted items, then that price will not change.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE on weighted items:</strong> Unit prices and available quantities for items sold by weight, including fresh meat, home meal solutions, and some bakery and cheese products, will vary by club and date.

The final price will be determined based on the item’s availability and payment choice.
If you choose to pay for a Club Pickup order in-club at the time of pickup (option not available for local delivery or additional pickup locations which must be paid on-line at the time of order placement), then the final price for the items will be based on the weight of the items actually available at time of pickup and the current in-club unit price, which may differ from the unit price shown on-line at the time of order placement.
If you choose to pay in advance on SamsClub.com at the time of order placement, then the final price for the items will be based on the weight of the items actually available at time of pickup (whether in-club or at pickup location) or delivery and the on-line unit price at the time of order placement.
