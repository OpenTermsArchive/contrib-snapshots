<b>ELECTRONIC FILING
SERVICES</b>.
If you choose to file your return electronically, your tax return
will be converted to a standardized format and transmitted to the applicable
federal taxing authority.
You are responsible for verifying the status of your
return to confirm that it has been received and accepted by the applicable
taxing authority and, if necessary, for filing it manually in the event that
the taxing authority rejects your electronically filed return (e.g., if the
taxpayer name and SSN don't match).
You agree to review your tax return before
electronically filing or mailing it and to print and save a copy (printed and
electronic) of any tax return prepared using the Forms Utility for your
records.
To the extent required by applicable law and regulation and the terms
of this Agreement, the information you provide will be stored and maintained.
If
you require a copy of your tax return, you must contact the IRS.
The IRS
requires us to notify it, in connection with the electronic filing of your tax
return, of the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the computer from which the
return originated and whether the email address of the person electronically
filing the return has been collected.
By using this electronic filing service
to prepare and submit your tax return, you consent to the disclosure to the IRS
and any other tax or revenue authority of all information relating to your use
of the Electronic Filing Services.

<b>ACCURACY OF CALCULATION
GUARANTEE</b>
<b>.
</b>If you are a registered user and you pay an IRS
penalty and/or interest solely because of a calculation error on a form which
was caused by the Forms Utility, but not as a result of, among other things,
your failure to enter all required information accurately, <p>
</p>
</p>
<p>your
substitution of a number for the one automatically computed by the program,
willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information on your tax return,
misclassification of information on the tax return, or failure to file an
amended return to avoid or reduce an applicable penalty/interest after release
of announced updates or corrections to the Forms Utility in time for you to
file an amended return, then we will pay you in the amount of the IRS penalty
and/or interest paid by you to the IRS.
In this regard, you are responsible for
keeping us apprised promptly of any change in your email address, mailing
address and/or phone number so that you can be notified of such updates or
corrections.
Calculations are defined in this regard to be the numerical
addition, subtraction or multiplication of numbers.
We are not responsible for
any errors introduced as a result of changes in tax law made by the Congress
during the tax season where we have not had a reasonable time to update the
Forms Utility for such changes.
You are responsible for paying any additional
tax liability you may owe, and providing any other information we reasonably
request.
A "registered user" is a user who has provided the
information necessary to permit such person to access, use and print or
electronically file a tax return prepared using the Forms Utility, who complies
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and who notifies us of any
changes to his or her contact information.
If you believe such a calculation
error occurred, you must notify us as soon as you learn of the mistake (and in
no event later than 30 days after the penalty or interest is assessed).
We will
then contact you promptly to resolve the issue.
To resolve your matter, you may
be required to provide your Forms Utility tax data file and other supporting
information such as a copy of the IRS notice, evidence of payment of the
specified penalty and/or interest, and a copy of your printed tax return or
estimated quarterly taxes form.
Your request must be forwarded to Free File
Alliance, 6367 Rolling Mill Place, Suite 102, Springfield, Virginia 22152.
