</ul> × FICO <p>FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation.
The FICO Score provided by Experian is based on FICO Score 8.
Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report.
Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8, or another type of credit score altogether.
Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 could vary from the score used by your lender.
The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8.</p>
<p>FICO Score 8 ranges from 300 to 850.
Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.
A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — Experian, TransUnion<sup>®</sup> and Equifax<sup>®</sup> — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report.
Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested.
Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.
So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.
Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.</p> Close
