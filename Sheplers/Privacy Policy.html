Conflict in Terms It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand.
We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind.

The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read.
This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary".
It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Statement upon which it is based.
It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Statement.
For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
