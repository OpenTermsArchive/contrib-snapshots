<b>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH OUR ONLINE PRODUCTS? </b>
<br> We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
<i>Personally Identifiable Information.</i>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information").
Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and payment information.
We may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website, subscribe to our Online Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time.
In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.
Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br> You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website.
However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or use all of our Online Products, such as subscribing to our online weight-loss tools or posting content to any Community Area on our Website.
A "Community Area" means any blog, personal page, group page, chat room, message board, bulletin board, recipe swap, or similar activity.
In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other Online Products dependent upon the collection of such information, such as a personalized WeightWatchers.com home page.
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</i>When you become a registered user of our Website, subscribe to one of our current Online Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time, we also may collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information like age, profession or gender ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").
Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in general and our Online Products in particular.
