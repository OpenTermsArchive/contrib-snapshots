(ii) geographic location which SparkPeople determines through your IP address.

The ad network provider may connect information about your visit on the Website with information about your visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information.
The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Website or any other sites on the internet if such other sites also have a relationship with the ad network provider.<br>
<br> The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by third party ad network providers is governed by each ad network provider’s specific privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.
