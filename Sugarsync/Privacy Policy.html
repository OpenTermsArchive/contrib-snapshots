<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by SugarSync and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers.

This is different than blocking "cookies" as browsers with the "do not track" option selected may still accept "cookies." Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may be adopted in the future.
We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time.
If we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly.
