<em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</em>
</strong> These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We and our third-party service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage.

These advertisements may be about United products and services or products and services of third parties that we think might be of interest to you.
United and our third party service providers may use cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.</p>
<p>In addition, some third party advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies and other tracking technologies.
This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, apps or otherwise.
Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third-party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this website, other websites or apps, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or our apps or otherwise take action.</p>
<p>Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Third party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAI”).
If they are members and you do not want to receive targeted advertisements from these third-party ad networks, you may opt out.
Information as to member companies, the practices of such third-party ad networks and your choices regarding having information used by these companies, including how to opt out, can be found at either: http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp for NAI members or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for DAI members.
Information on how to opt out of the use of your information by DoubleClick is available at http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/ and information on how to opt out of Google Analytics is available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
<p>Opting out of one or more NAI or DAI members means that only those particular members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you.
It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites.
If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out pages and then you erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer be active.</p> Third-party analytics <p>We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate the use of our websites and apps and the services we provide.
We use these tools to gather information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences.
These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our websites with other information that they have collected.
This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.</p> Your access to your information <p>If you are a MileagePlus member, you can create, view or update your MileagePlus account by accessing it through the MileagePlus profile section on united.com or by calling 1-800-421-4655.
You may also update information relevant to your use of our mobile application(s) through the app itself.</p> Protecting information collected <p>United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.
When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites.
Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p>
<p>If a third party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction.
Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has your consent and authorization to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude you have given them your consent to do so.
Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices.
If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p> Your role in protecting your information <p>To protect your privacy and United’s proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information.
You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them.
We do not have control over the security of your mobile device.
United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device.
The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p> Opting out <p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded.
In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change.
Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future.
Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p> Location of your information/Data transfer/Notice to non-US persons
<p>United will transfer, store, and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country.
In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy.
By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p> Other sites/digital channels <p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third party sites.
Any access to and use of such linked sites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party sites.
We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party sites.</p> Contact us <p>If you have comments or questions about this Privacy Policy, please submit your inquiry to United Customer Care.
Please reference this Privacy Policy in those communications.</p> Legal effect and changes to the policy <p>As previously stated, this Privacy Policy is not a contract nor does it otherwise create any legal rights or obligations.
Rather, this Privacy Policy merely reflects guidelines setting forth United’s intended business practices.
By using any United digital channel, and/or by providing any information to United online or offline, you consent to the collection and use of such information by United, its affiliates, partners, contractors and permitted agents as herein described and consistent with applicable laws.
