Subaru reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting to this Web site.
We suggest periodically visiting the page to review our policy.
This Privacy Policy applies when Subaru collects both personal information and non-personal information from and about individuals, including through Subaru-controlled websites or applications, and through Subaru-controlled applications accessed or used on a mobile, handheld or other device (a "Website" or "Application").
It also applies to information individuals voluntarily provide to us "offline," such as at events.
This Privacy Policy explains the privacy practices of Subaru including: (1) how Subaru uses the personal information you share with us and that we learn about you from third parties; (2) how Subaru uses "cookies" and similar technology; (3) what personal information Subaru may share about you and in what circumstances; (4) what kind of security measures Subaru takes to protect your information and what steps Subaru will take in the event of a security breach; and (5) the process through which you can change the Personal Information that Subaru retains in its records and to modify your preferences.
We do not collect Personal Information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, although we may collect Personal Information about you from third parties, as described in more detail below.
"Personal Information" includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you (e.
g.
, your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and location).
By disclosing your Personal Information to us or by using our Websites or Applications, you consent to our collection and use of your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT Subaru collects and uses the information you provide to us.
We may also obtain information about you from outside sources and may combine it with the information you provide to us.
For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic information about you from third parties, get device ID information from mobile applications or advertisements or purchase e-mail or similar lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes.
As a general matter, we may use or share your Personal Information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do.
We may also use this information for our internal research purposes as we develop our products and services.
We may use Personal Information and data collected for our advertising or marketing purposes including on other websites or media and we may communicate with you to provide you with information we think may be of interest to you.

If you make a request for information, for example, we might need to provide your name, mailing address, or email address to one of our dealers or a service provider with whom we have a relationship so that they can help us respond to you.
Specifically, we collect and use information from you in certain ways including: Processing Your Requests.
When you interact with us (for example, to request a brochure or locate a dealer) you will be asked for information needed to complete your request.
The information you provide is used to process your transactions, to create and share reports about these transactions, and/or to provide related customer service.
