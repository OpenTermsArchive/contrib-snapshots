2.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT Personal Information "Personal Information" is the information that identifies you as an individual, such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address and credit or debit card number.
Personal Information You Submit We collect Personal Information when you submit it to us, including but not limited to when you register for or subscribe to certain products or services, create a profile, participate in a sweepstakes or contest, take a survey, use an interactive feature (such as Email-to-a-Friend), or participate in a forum.
Personal Information We Receive from Third Parties We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications.
For example, if you access an Online Service through a third party connection or log-in, such as Facebook Connect, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to us.
This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
Other Information "Other Information" is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as browser information, information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information, and aggregated information.
We may combine Other Information with your Personal Information, and when we do, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.
Other Information You Submit We collect Other Information when you submit it to us.
It may include your gender, education, occupation, financial information (such as your income, investments, portfolio transactions and value, and other information), interests, photos, connections, and comments.
Other Information We Receive from Third Parties We may receive Other Information about you from third parties, including, for example, demographic data, information about your interests, and information about your activities on other websites.
Other Information We Collect Automatically When You are Online When you access our Online Services, we automatically collect certain information about those visits.
For example, in order to permit your connection to our Online Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, potentially including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access our Online Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device ("UDID") or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.
Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.
We may use these technologies to facilitate our login processes; personalize your experience on WSJDN Services; display relevant content, products, services and advertising, as described further below; and collect and store information about your usage of our Online Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.
We may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Online Services to Personal Information obtained from you or a reputable third party.
For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or clickstream data about your activities on our Online Services may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
Third parties that support our Online Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect Other Information.
Dow Jones may not control these third-party technologies and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION We use the Personal Information we collect from and about you for the purposes set forth below.
Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.
To improve the quality of our products and services, we may combine the Personal and Other Information we collect with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of other Dow Jones products, services and websites, or information from third parties.
To provide and manage our services.
We use the information we collect from and about you to provide our products and services and features to you, including: to process and fulfill your subscription, to send you information about your relationship or transactions with us, to measure and improve those services and features, to personalize your experience to allow you to comment on content, participate in online games, contests, promotions or rewards programs, to provide you with customer support, and to respond to inquiries.
Some Online Services use the information we collect in site-specific ways.
For example: FINS Resume Database.
FINS (fins.
com) offers you the opportunity to create an online profile and store it in our database.
When you create a profile on our system, you can choose one of the following options: (a) you can designate your profile as "Private" which means that your profile will not be shared with employers or recruiters unless you apply directly for a job, or (b) you can designate your profile as "Searchable" which means you allow your profile, including your name and contact information, to be searchable and viewable by employers or recruiters.
IF YOU ELECT TO MAKE YOUR PROFILE SEARCHABLE, ALL INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION) THAT YOU INCLUDE IN YOUR PROFILE MAY BE VIEWED BY RECRUITERS AND EMPLOYERS.
YOU SHOULD NOT ENTER ANY INFORMATION IN THE BODY OF YOUR PROFILE THAT YOU WISH TO REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL.
We do not screen the credentials of employers or recruiters before allowing them to conduct searches in our database.
Dow Jones is not responsible for the retention, use or privacy practices of that employer or recruiter after it has received your information.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, third parties who accessed the database or obtained a copy of your resume may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances.
FINS Job Alerts.
FINS offers you the opportunity to sign up for job match alerts.
These matches are generated by comparing a user's profile to our job database using our matching software.
If you would like to review, change or delete your resume or job match alert, you can do so by signing in here and following directions to edit.
To deliver relevant content and recommendations.
To make your experience more interesting and personalized, we may use any of the Personal and Other Information we collect to assist us in delivering content on our Online Services.

Information about your activities on our Online Services and other non-personally identifiable information about you may be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.
