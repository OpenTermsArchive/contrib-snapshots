<b>Security </b> The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number, date of birth, and/or geo-location data) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
To learn more about SSL, follow this link.
<br>
<br>All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (AES with 128 and 256 bit secret key).
While the secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download.
Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time.
<br>
<br>If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers.
As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.
<br>
<br>We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personally identifiable information when you are on the Internet.
Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
