This data includes usage and user statistics.
Emails sent by SurveyMonkey or by users through our services include page tags that allow the sender to collect information about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them.
We provide more information on cookies below and in our Cookies Policy.</li>
<li>Log Data.<br>Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type and timestamps.</li>
<li>Referral information.<br>If you arrive at a SurveyMonkey website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</li>

For example, your default language, time zone and communication preferences (e.g.
opting in or out of receiving marketing communications from SurveyMonkey).</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of some of our services will also result in us collecting the following data on your behalf:</p>
<ul>

See our “Respondent” section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 3.2 Respondent <i>á</i>
<p>We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us, which are described in detail in this privacy policy.
We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used.
Our primary goal is to improve upon and make sure our services and messaging are relevant for all our users, while also ensuring that personal information of all users is respected and protected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cookies (to include page tags).</p>
<p>We collect information using cookies when you take a survey.
These cookies are used to ensure that the full functionality of our survey service is operational, to ensure the survey operates appropriately and optimally.
For more information please read our Cookies section below and our Respondent Cookies Policy.
After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be re-directed to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates.
We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contact Information.</p>
<p>As a Respondent, we only use contact information to respond to an inquiry which you submit to us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Our customer support team use your email address to communicate with you if you have contacted us about a survey, form, application or questionnaire you received, but we will not send marketing to you unless you have otherwise opted-in to marketing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How you use our services (applicable to survey Respondents only).</p>
<p>We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>We collect information about the types of questions you answer.
This data will be aggregated and anonymized so we can examine patterns in terms of respondent preferences when submitting responses (see further below in Information for Survey Respondent section).
We collect and use all this data for our legitimate interests like helping us improve the experience for respondents (so that questions are easier to answer), to understand industry trends in and to help improve the completion rates on surveys/forms.</p>
<p>We will also use usage information such as the type of survey, form, questionnaire or application that you answered to personalize products we show you on completion of a survey when you are re-directed to our website.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Device and browser data.</p>
<p>We use device data to, for example, troubleshoot issues to make improvements with our services and to infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>We collect this to ensure that service experience works well across all possible devices and to infer geographic location to produce aggregated data around Respondent location trends.
We also want to use this information to provide an additional data layer to Creators so that they can filter responses by e.g.
inferred geographic location.
Note however, that we do not collect precise GPS co-ordinate location.
We just infer location from IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Device and browser data.</p>
<p>We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it.
We also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Examples</p>
<p>We collect this to ensure that service experience works well across all possible devices and to infer geographic location to produce aggregated data around Respondent location trends.
We also want to use this information to provide an additional data layer to Creators so that they can filter responses by e.g.
inferred geographic location.
Note however, that we do not collect precise GPS co-ordinate location.
We just infer location from IP address.
Finally we will use this information to compare and look at trends on how our service operates and how you interact with surveys, on different browsers and devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log data.</p>
<p>We use log data for many different business purposes to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To monitor abuse and troubleshoot.</li>
<li>To create new services, features, content or make recommendations.</li>
<li>To track behavior at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services.</li>
<li>To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing), for abuse monitoring purposes (so we can identify a Respondent who abused the survey taking experience in a manner contrary to our usage policies or to facilitate the Creator in complying with their own legal obligations.
We also collect log data to collate aggregated data and metrics on activity at a non-identifying level and so that we can identify trends in survey taking over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Third parties and integrations.</p>
<p>We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Machine learning.</p>
<p>We will use machine learning techniques on response data, metadata (as described above) and cookie data, in order to provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services, to build features, improve our services and to develop aggregated data products.
You can read more about this in relation to surveys below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>To respond to legal requests or prevent fraud, we may need to disclose any information or data we hold about you.
If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of survey responses (SurveyMonkey surveys only)</p>
<p>In general survey responses to SurveyMonkey surveys are controlled and managed by the Creator (the person who sent or deployed that survey).
In those instances SurveyMonkey is only processing those responses on behalf of the Creator.</p>
<p>Creator and Respondent trust is paramount to everything we do and so when we do use data about Respondents, we put Creators and Respondents first.
When we do analysis of response data we only do so once we have ensured the anonymity of individual respondents (by aggregating and anonymizing the data).</p>
<p>Our goal is to improve the user experience across SurveyMonkey survey services while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of responses.</p>
<p>We go into more detail below on how SurveyMonkey uses survey data.
A Creator has some controls over how we use responses in their Account settings and may have turned off our ability to use responses where it is feature linked.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey uses data in the ways described below, for legitimate interests pursued by it which are described in this section:</p>
<p>The data impacted by this section includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey type, question type and responses (at an aggregated and anonymized level only);</li>
<li>Device data</li>
<li>Log data</li>
</ul>
<p>SurveyMonkey will use automated processes and machine learning, to analyze survey responses, which in turn helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate response data and activity: We will aggregate responses, activity and behavior of Respondents so that we can identify trends, build product features that optimize responses, make product recommendations and provide guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios.
These product features also provide feedback and recommendations to increase response rates.
For an example of this check out how SurveyMonkey Genius works.
See more about SurveyMonkey Genius here.</li>
<li>
<p>Extract and analyze usage patterns: By understanding response data and Respondent interaction in different types of surveys we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve our services and ease of use: for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected.
We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses,</li>
<li>undertake personalization for survey Creators and Respondents (for example by customizing the page on our website which a Respondent sees at the end of a survey - See more about Customizing Survey End Page here.).
If a Respondent does not want to be included in this personalization they can clear the cookies in their browser settings after taking a survey,</li>
<li>improve user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers), and</li>
<li>identify insightful data trends (which never identifies any individuals).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>6.
Cookies</p>
<p>We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites.
For more information see our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>We use certain cookies, as described in our Cookies Policy and here in our Privacy Policy, that you agree to when you use our sites and, in the case of some cookies, for legitimate interests of delivering and optimizing our services (where the cookie delivers essential functionality).
Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users.
Each cookie expires after a certain period of time, depending on what we use it for.
We use cookies and similar technologies for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To gather metrics about your survey taking experience.<br>For example, we will collect data about the number of clicks it took Respondents to complete a survey, whether they left and returned to a survey, whether they skipped parts of a survey and how long it took to complete the survey and other details about the survey taking.
However, this information is collated and kept at an aggregated and anonymized level only.</li>
<li>To make our site easier to use.<br>Creators if you use the “Remember me” feature when you sign into your account, we store your username in a cookie to make it quicker for you to sign in whenever you return to SurveyMonkey.</li>
<li>For security reasons.<br>We use cookies to authenticate your identity and confirm whether you are currently logged into SurveyMonkey or determine if an incident impacts you.</li>
<li>To provide you with personalized content.<br>We store user preferences, your default language, device and browser information, your profile information which includes, the level of usage of service and the web-pages on our site which you visit, so we can personalize the content you see.</li>
<li>To improve our services.<br>We use cookies to measure your usage of our websites and track referral data, as well as to occasionally display different versions of content to you.
This information helps us to develop and improve our services (it helps us focus on the parts of the service you seem most interested in) and optimize the content we display to you (which may include marketing content).</li>
<li>To advertise to you.<br>We, or our service providers and other third parties we work with, place cookies when you visit our website and other websites or when you open emails that we send you, in order to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective.
For instance, we evaluate which ads are clicked on most often, and whether those clicks lead users to make better use of our tools, features and services.
If you don’t want to receive ads that are tailored to you based on your online activity, you may “opt out” of many of the companies that are involved in such tailoring by going to https://www.aboutads.info, https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ or, if you’re located in the European Union, at https://www.youronlinechoices.eu.
Opting out in this way does not mean you will not receive any ads.
it just means that you will not receive ads from such companies that have been tailored to you based on your activities and inferred preferences.</li>
<li>Google Analytics.<br>In addition to the above, we have implemented on our websites and other services certain Google Analytics features that support Display Advertising, including re-targeting.
Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google Analytics tracking, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center.
If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to remove or disable cookies via your browser settings.</p>
<p>7.
Security</p>
<p>We have a security statement related to our self-serve businesses (SurveyMonkey and Wufoo) available to view here.
For information about security related to our other business lines you can speak to a sales representative by completing the form here.</p>
<p>8.
Data Retention</p>
<p>If you hold an account with SurveyMonkey we do not delete the data in your account – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data.
There are controls in your account where you can delete data at the account level (all data in your account) and at the response level.
If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Creator how long your responses will be stored in SurveyMonkey services.</p>
<p>We also describe the expiry periods for cookies on our websites in our cookies policy.</p>
<p>9.
Safety of Minors</p>
<p>Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors.
“Minors” are individuals under the age of 13 (or under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence).
SurveyMonkey does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors or allow them to register.
If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice.
If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.</p>
<p>10.
Privacy Shield (relevant to our EU users)</p>
<p>EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey Europe UC has entered into contractual terms to include standard contractual clauses with SurveyMonkey Inc.
for the transfer of data to SurveyMonkey Inc.
as part of delivery of service.
SurveyMonkey Inc.
is located in the United States and accordingly, data (to include Respondent data) will be transferred to the United States.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey Inc.
participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield.
SurveyMonkey is committed to subjecting all personal information and data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.
https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>When SurveyMonkey receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on SurveyMonkey’s behalf, SurveyMonkey has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) SurveyMonkey is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, SurveyMonkey is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, SurveyMonkey may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>Please contact SurveyMonkey as described in the as described in Section 14 section below if you have any concerns or complaints of any nature.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider, (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>11.
Changes to our privacy policy</p>
<p>We can make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.
We will identify the changes we have made on this page.
In circumstances where a change will materially change the way in which we collect or use your personal information or data, we will send a notice of this change to all of our account holders.</p>
<p>12.
Personalized marketing</p>
<p>You can opt-out from direct marketing in your account and we provide opt-out options in all direct marketing emails.
Finally, if you do not wish to see personalized marketing content on the web related to our service you can clear the cookies in your browser settings.
See our Help Center article on how to do this here.</p>
<p>13.
Who is my data controller?</p>
<p>As mentioned above – all response data at an individual level is controlled by the Creator.
SurveyMonkey can be a data controller of data about Respondents only in the very limited ways described in the section here called “How we use the information we collect - Respondent”.
To the extent that is the case we have identified the correct controller below.</p>
<p>For Creators, Respondents, Website Visitors and Panel who are addressed in this privacy policy and who are located outside the United States, your data controller is SurveyMonkey Europe UC to the extent that it is processing your personal data.</p>
<p>14.
Your rights</p>
<p>Some of you (in particular, European users and those whose information we receive under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield) have certain legal rights to obtain information about whether we hold personal information about them, to access personal information we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.
Some of these rights may be subject to some exceptions or limitations.

<ul>
<li> Creator <i>á</i>

<p>By way of reminder, SurveyMonkey also enables you to export your own response data from our system in a variety of formats so that you can back it up, or use it with other applications.</p>
</li>
<li> Respondent <i>á</i>
<p>Where you have responded to a survey, form, questionnaire or application sent to you by a Creator, using a SurveyMonkey service, you will need to reach out directly to that individual or organization to discuss managing, deleting, accessing, restricting access to or otherwise withdrawing consent for use of, the information which you provided to them in your responses.
SurveyMonkey does not control your response data and, accordingly, is not in a position to directly handle these requests in relation to that data.

Information specific to other services</p>
<ul>
<li> 16.1 TechValidate <i>á</i>
<p>Contact Information for Respondents</p>
<p>The SurveyMonkey Privacy Policy applies to our Techvalidate users except where the Privacy Policy specifies a section that is only applicable to our SurveyMonkey survey tool.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey will never independently use contact information for Respondents which you provide, to contact and communicate with that Respondent.
The only circumstances where SurveyMonkey would independently speak to these Respondents would be where they reached out to us separately to inquire about any of our services unrelated to a specific customer’s account or project.</p>
<p>TechFacts</p>
<p>TechFacts are published on an anonymous basis, – that is, no Respondent Personal Information displayed in a TechFact unless your Respondents authorize the use of their name and company affiliation.
You are able to see the individual respondent’s identity in your account and, if you give a SurveyMonkey employee permission to view that response then SurveyMonkey will also see this.
However, we never publish or disseminate this information (unless you explicitly ask us to).</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey assigns a unique identification number to each TechFact.
The ID will appear on each copy of the TechFact.
Our site is designed so that visitors may look up and view TechFacts without the collection of any personal information (except for such visitor's internet protocol (IP) address).</p>
</li>
<li> 16.2 SM Apply / FluidReview <i>á</i>
<p>SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview is an online application system that helps organizations collect applications, manage subscriptions and facilitate reviews.
The SurveyMonkey Privacy Policy applies to apply.surveymonkey.com/www.fluidreview.com (“SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview”) except where the Privacy Policy specifies a section that is applicable only to our SurveyMonkey survey tool.
Responses and Respondents in this privacy policy are intended as reference to applicants and their applications for the purposes of use of FluidReview.</p>
<p>Data locations.
The servers on which SurveyMonkey Apply/FluidReview operate are located in Canada, so your information will be hosted in Canada.
Additionally, your information may be processed in and transferred or disclosed to countries in which our affiliates are located and in which our service providers are located or have servers.
You can view where our affiliates are located on the Office Locations page.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about your personal information in the context of our SM Apply or FluidReview services, you can contact us at support@fluidreview.com.</p>

<li>We would like to emphasize that we will not use your form data to compete with you, market to your clients, or contact them for any other means of profit.
We will also not sell your form data to anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Control of your form data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download/backup your form data.
We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your form data in a variety of formats.
