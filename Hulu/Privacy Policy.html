<br>
<br> Security, Kids, and Other Information How does Hulu protect the information it collects from or about me? <p>We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.
For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit.
We also take steps to ensure that only those Hulu employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your information are granted access.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information on our order forms), we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL), an industry standard protocol for billing transmission in order to help protect the financial information you send us.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We want you to feel confident using the Hulu Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
Please refer to the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.</p> Does Hulu collect information from children under the age of 13? <p>Hulu prohibits registration or subscription by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.</p> Do any special considerations apply to visitors from outside the United States? <p>Hulu is an online video service based in the U.S., and our offices are headquartered in the U.S.
Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Hulu Services may be processed and transferred to the U.S.
and be subject to U.S.
law.
The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S.
may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence.
By using our website, participating in any of the Hulu Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S.</p> What happens when Hulu changes its Privacy Policy? <p>From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law or changes to the scope of the Hulu Services or for other reasons.
Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted at http://www.hulu.com/privacy each time you visit Hulu.com or use any of the Hulu Services to ensure you are familiar with the most updated policies and practices.
If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting notice on Hulu.com or by sending you an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to such revisions taking effect.
If the material revisions concern practices where we have represented that we will obtain your consent to use or disclose your personally identifiable information, we will obtain your consent before taking any action inconsistent with those representations.</p>
<br>
<br> Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies What technologies are used to understand how people use the Hulu Services? <p>On Hulu, we, along with our partners and vendors, use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Hulu Services and the Internet.
This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Cookies.
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.
Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.
They enable us to make your use of the Hulu Services more enjoyable.</li>
<ul>
<li>For example, we, along with our partners and vendors, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information about you that we have collected, such as your interests.
Cookies are one way that we store this kind of information.
</li>
<li>We, along with our partners and vendors, may also use cookies and similar technologies to relate your use of the Hulu Services to information we obtain from you or from reputable third parties, and to compile aggregate data.
For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Hulu Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.
</li>
<li>You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.</li>
<li>Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers and the companies that help them deliver their ads (sometimes called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”).
For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Hulu.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Other local storage.
We, along with our partners and vendors, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Hulu Services, including the video player.
Sometimes called “browser cookies,” these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here.
Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.</li>
<li>
Web beacons.
We, along with our partners and vendors, may also use technologies that communicate information from your Internet browser or the Hulu video player to a web server, including so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”).
Pixel Tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed.
We use Pixel Tags to improve your Hulu experience, including to provide you with content customized to your interests.</li>
</ul>
<br> Social Networking How does Hulu work with social networks such as Facebook? <ul>
<li>
Hulu and Social Networking.
If you choose to link your Hulu account with a social networking service, Hulu and that service may share certain information about you and your activities.
With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you watch on Hulu, with that social network’s users.</li>
<li>
Connecting with Facebook While Using the Hulu Services.
Facebook and Hulu have developed a process that allows you to connect your Hulu account with your Facebook account.
When you connect your accounts, you authorize Hulu and Facebook to share certain information about you with each other.
With your consent, we may also share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook and its users including publishing your watch activity to Facebook.
This section provides information on how this sharing works.
<ul>
<li>
Sharing on Facebook.
If you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, Hulu will ask you if you want to automatically share information about your activities on the Hulu Services to Facebook.
When you choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook, Facebook may make that information visible to Facebook users in accordance with applicable law, the Facebook Data Use Policy, and your Facebook privacy settings.
We recommend that you familiarize yourself with Facebook’s Data Use Policy and privacy controls.
You can always stop or start sharing your activities on the Hulu Service with Facebook at any time using the Account &gt.
Privacy and Settings controls on Hulu.</li>
<li>
Sharing on Hulu.
When you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, Hulu will access the list of all your Facebook friends and import them to Hulu.
All of your Facebook friends who have also connected their Hulu and Facebook accounts will be connected to you on Hulu.
Any Facebook friend who connects his or her Hulu and Facebook accounts at a later date will also automatically be connected to you on Hulu.
This means that, if you choose to share your activities on the Hulu Services, all of your Facebook friends who have connected their Facebook and Hulu accounts will be able to see what you watch when they use Hulu.
You can always stop or start sharing your activities on the Hulu Service at any time using the Account &gt.
Privacy and Settings controls on Hulu.</li>
<li>
Separate Lists of Friends.
Although Hulu imports all of your friends from Facebook, the Hulu and Facebook privacy settings are separate.
This means that your Facebook privacy controls do not control who can see your activity on Hulu.
As a result, if you choose to connect your Facebook and Hulu accounts and enable sharing, then all of your Facebook friends will be able to see your Hulu activity when they use Hulu.
Right now, the best way to stop sharing your activity on Hulu with a Facebook friend is to turn off social sharing or unfriend that person on Facebook.
If you unfriend someone on Facebook there may be some reasonable delay, while Hulu and Facebook process changes to your Facebook friend list, before we update who can see your activity on Hulu.
You can always review the current list of who can see your activity on Hulu using the Community controls.</li>
<li>In addition, if you visit Hulu while logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that Facebook already has about you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br> Third-Party Advertising On Hulu How does third-party advertising on Hulu impact me? <p>Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Clicking on or Viewing Ads.
When you click on or view an advertisement, the advertiser may collect some information from or about you.
Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers.
You should check the privacy policy of the advertiser whose website you visit to determine how it handles any information it separately collects from you.
Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services.</li>
<li>
Use of Cookies in Third-Party Advertising.
Companies that advertise on Hulu and the providers that help them deliver their ads may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Hulu Services in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content.
The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
Information Shared with Advertisers and Advertising Companies.
Hulu may share aggregate information with advertisers and the companies that help them deliver their ads so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed in connection with the Hulu Services.
For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.</li>
<li>
Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising.
Some of these advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies.
If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their members’ use of your information, please click here.
Some of the third parties that collect information on the Hulu Services in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
This program offers a single location where users can make choices about the use of their information for ad targeting.
