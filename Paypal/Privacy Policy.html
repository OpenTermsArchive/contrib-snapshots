<p>We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the PayPal Services.
This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page.
Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.</p>

<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.
You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.</p>
<p>We and our service-providers also use cookies to customize our services, content and advertising.
measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
<br>
<br> You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the PayPal Services on certain websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a webpage created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application).
<br>
<br>
</p> Back to top <strong>How we protect and store personal information</strong>
<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.
We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
<p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and at various customer and operations support centers around the world such as in the Philippines, Ireland, Canada, and China, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards.
We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p> Back to top <strong>How we use the personal information we collect</strong>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.
To that end, we use your personal information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
<li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions</li>
<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;</li>
<li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website;</li>
<li>deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;</li>
<li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li>
</ul>Back to top <strong>Marketing</strong>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third-parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising.
If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference by logging into your account going to the Profile subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.</p> Back to top <strong>How we share personal information with other PayPal users</strong>
<p>To process your payments, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you.
Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other PayPal users who you transact with through PayPal.
In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access PayPal services.
Unless you agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any other purpose other than to enable the PayPal Services.</p>
<p>If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may also provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller.
The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it.</p>
<p>We work with third parties, including merchants to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using PayPal.
In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, when a payment is sent to you or, when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party.
We use this information to confirm to that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment .
<br>
<br> Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through PayPal or with the third parties that offer or use the PayPal Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card association rules, a valid regulatory or law enforcement request, or, to cooperate in an ongoing law enforcement investigation, as otherwise required by law.
