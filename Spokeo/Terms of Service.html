Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
</p>
<p>Please read this carefully.
It affects your rights.
</p>
<p>a) Disputes Subject to Arbitration.
Spokeo and You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, including, but not limited to:
</p>
<p>• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
</p>
<p>• claims that arose before this or any prior agreement between us (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or disclosures).
and
</p>
<p>• claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, provided that it seeks relief that does not affect other customers.
</p>
<p>Any dispute as to the arbitrability of claims or the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision, or as to the interpretation of paragraph (19)(e) below, is for the court to decide.
These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the agreement between us.
</p>
<p>(b) Starting the Dispute-Resolution Process.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).
The Notice to Spokeo should be addressed to: General Counsel, Spokeo, Inc., 556 S.
Fair Oaks Ave., Suite # 101-179, Pasadena, CA USA 91105 (“Notice Address”).
The Notice must (a) provide Your mailing address, phone number, and account name (if any).
(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
If Spokeo and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, You or Spokeo may commence an arbitration proceeding with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
</p>
<p>(c) Costs of Arbitration.
Spokeo will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration we initiate.
The payment of those fees for any arbitration that You initiate will be governed by the AAA Rules.
The filing fee currently is $125 for claims for up to $10,000 in damages, but is subject to change by the AAA.
However, if you initiate an arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements of paragraph (19)(b) and are seeking relief valued at $300 or less (both to You and us), Spokeo will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.
If your claim is for greater than $300 but less than $10,000, Spokeo will pay all such fees in excess of $20.
After Spokeo receives notice at the Notice Address that You have commenced such an arbitration, Spokeo will promptly reimburse you for any portion of the filing fee that you paid that Spokeo has agreed to pay..
</p>
<p>If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules, and You agree to reimburse us for any amounts we have paid on Your behalf to the AAA.
</p>
<p>(d) Arbitration Procedures.
The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this arbitration provision.
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this arbitration provision.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
The AAA shall administer the arbitration.
If the AAA is unavailable, the arbitration will be administered by another arbitration provider that the parties agree to or that the court selects.
</p>
<p>Unless Spokeo and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your residence at the time of the filing of the Demand.
If you bring a claim for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
</p>
<p>Arbitrators may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different customers.
Arbitrators shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law.
</p>
<p>Unless the parties agree otherwise, You and we must bring all directly related claims in a single arbitration proceeding.
If You or we later initiate a subsequent arbitration asserting claims that are directly related to ones that were raised in a prior arbitration between the same parties, the AAA or the arbitrator shall either (i) consolidate the subsequent arbitration with the earlier proceeding if it is ongoing or (ii) dismiss any claims raised in the subsequent arbitration that would be barred by applicable law if brought in court.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
Although under some laws Spokeo may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Spokeo agrees that it will not seek such an award unless You are represented by an attorney and the arbitrator has determined that Your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
</p>
<p>(e) Prohibition of Class or Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
YOU AND SPOKEO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR PARTICIPANT IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both You and Spokeo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding.
The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, so long as the relief is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other Spokeo users.
Neither You nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other Spokeo users.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
</p>
<p>(f) Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate.

Entire Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>a) These Terms and any Spokeo policies posted on Spokeo.com constitute the entire contract between You and Spokeo and supersede all previous written or oral contracts.
Except as provided in paragraph (19)(e), if any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
Any failure by us to enforce any term of the Terms shall not affect our right to require performance at any subsequent time, nor shall the waiver by us of any breach by you of any provisions of these terms be taken to be a waiver of the provision or provisions itself.
Apple, Inc.
and its subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and they are entitled to enforce these Terms.
